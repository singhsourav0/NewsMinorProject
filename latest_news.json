Justice Varma has denied any wrongdoing by him or his family.\nDhankhar's official schedule had listed a visit to the western city of Jaipur on Wednesday in his capacity as vice president.\nBut on Monday evening, he submitted his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu, saying he wanted \"to prioritise health care and abide by medical advice\".\n\"It has been a privilege and satisfaction to witness and partake in India's remarkable economic progress and unprecedented exponential development during this significant period. Serving in this transformative era of our nation's history has been a true honour,\" Dhankar said in the letter.\nThe abrupt move sent ripples through political circles, with some remarking that they had spoken to Dhankhar just hours before his resignation.\n\"What is going on in this government?\" asked Anand Dubey, spokesperson of the Shiv Sena (UBT) party.\n\"This decision came without proper consultation or discussion.

In 2019, he was appointed the governor of West Bengal state where he was often at loggerheads with the state government, run by the Trinamool Congress party.\nHe resigned as governor in 2022 after the BJP nominated him as vice president.\nDhankhar underwent angioplasty in Delhi in March but quickly resumed his duties and remained active in parliament.\nWith the vice president's seat now vacant, his responsibilities are likely to be handled by the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha or another member designated by the president.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Warning: The story contains distressing details \nA BBC Hindi investigation reveals that Indian officials quietly paid compensation to the families of more people than they admit died in a deadly crowd crush at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival which is the world's largest religious gathering.\nThe official death toll is 37, but the BBC found 26 additional cases where families received partial compensation in cash, and 18 more deaths where no payment was made.\nOn 25 March, a team of plain-clothed police officers from India's northern Uttar Pradesh (UP) state arrived in neighbouring Bihar with bundles of cash.\nThe team visited Gopalganj city, where they met the family of 62-year-old Tara Devi. They handed over 500,000 rupees ($5,758; \u00a34,291) in cash to her son, Dhananjay Gond, and asked him to record a statement on video.\nIn the video, Dhananjay introduces himself, saying: \"My mother Tara Devi and I went to the Kumbh Mela for a holy dip. My mother died. Officers from UP came and gave us 500,000 rupees. We have received it.\"\nDhananjay says his mother was killed in the crowd crush in the city of Prayagraj in UP on 29 January.\nThe UP government has not yet released an official list of the crush victims. Tara Devi's son says police told him the money he got was the first instalment of the 2.5m rupees officially promised to victims' families. Dhananjay says he hasn't received the remaining 2m rupees.\nThe UP government says it has paid 2.5m rupees each to the families of 35 victims (of the 37 deaths, one victim remains unidentified, and another does not have a legal heir). A three-member judicial commission set up to investigate the incident and submit a report within a month has had its tenure extended.\nThe BBC, however, found one more family which was given a cheque of 2.5m rupees. For the other 35 victims, the compensation was transferred to relatives' bank accounts.\nApart from this, the BBC found 26 cases - including that of Tara Devi - where police paid 500,000 rupees in cash at people's homes.\nIn many instances, officials had families sign documents blaming health issues for the deaths, despite them insisting that their relatives died in the crush. (The UP government typically does not compensate for natural deaths during the Kumbh, held every 12 years.)\nThe BBC also confirmed 18 deaths where no compensation was given (excluding the case mentioned above where there was no legal heir).\nIt also found evidence of four separate crush incidents in Prayagraj on 29 January, despite Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's claim that only one occurred at what is called the Sangam nose - the point of confluence of three sacred rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati.\nIn the weeks after the Kumbh crush, the BBC met over 100 families across 11 states in India, who claimed their relatives died in the tragedy. It verified 82 deaths in total with concrete evidence, excluding cases lacking proof.\nSome families hold post-mortems, morgue slips, death certificates, or photos and videos as proof. The BBC cross-checked local newspaper reports and spoke to district reporters to trace where bodies were received, mapped these locations, and then visited the victims' families.\nThe BBC interviewed families and eyewitnesses to reconstruct timelines for each case - when the victims left for the holy dip, the time of the crush, nearby landmarks, the distance from the bathing site and the immediate aftermath.\nFrom these detailed accounts, clear patterns emerged, leading to the identification of four crush locations: Sangam Nose, Jhusi side of Samudrakup Chauraha, Airavat Marg, and Mukti Marg Chauraha near Kalpavriksha Gate.\nMost of the full 2.5m-rupee compensation cases list the death location as \"Ward No. 7, Fort Cantt, Prayagraj\", about 1.5km (0.9 miles) from Sangam Nose.\nIn contrast, the cases that received 500,000 rupees mostly mention \"Sector-20 or Sector-21, Kumbh Mela area, Jhusi\". Some of these families claim their relatives also died near Sangam Nose, but that their certificates wrongly cite Jhusi - possibly to downplay the scale of the tragedy there.\nAs for the 18 families which did not receive any compensation, there does not seem to be a common thread binding them.\nFor instance, at one crush location, the BBC identified five bodies through photos and the numbers issued during post-death formalities. Of these, the families of three victims received 500,000 rupees in cash, while the other two received nothing. Some other families have photographs from the day of the crush which show bodies of their relatives, but these deaths have not been acknowledged by the government.\nThe BBC repeatedly tried to contact UP government officials, emailing the information department and district magistrate. Despite promises by the district magistrate's office, no call was arranged. Attempts to reach the UP police chief went unanswered, while Prayagraj's police commissioner at the time of the incident, Tarun Gaba, and Mela officer Vijay Kiran Anand refused to answer questions.\nThe BBC has also found evidence of deaths in crushes that took place at locations other than the Sangam Nose, which the government has acknowledged through giving some compensation.\nIn UP's Jaunpur, Dharmraj Rajbhar received 500,000 rupees each for the deaths of his wife and daughter-in-law in the Airavat Marg crush.\nA video shot by the BBC on 29 January shows the family sitting with both bodies at the site. Back home, Rajbhar displayed the cash bundles and said, \"The government promised 2.5m rupees, but the police gave only 500,000 rupees each and left.\"\nThe UP police also travelled hundreds of kilometres to Paschim Bardhaman in West Bengal, where they handed over 500,000 rupees to the family of Vinod Ruidas.\nNot all families accepted the amount, though. In Bihar, the relatives of Sunaina Devi rejected it. They told the BBC that they refused to \"sign false documents\".\nThe BBC also identified at least\u202ffive families\u202fwho lost their relatives near Kalpavriksha Gate, about 3-4km from Sangam Nose.\nKusum Devi, the wife of Panne Lal Sahni, says that her husband died around 8am on 29 January. \"People were stepping over his body. I sat in the sun with his corpse until 4pm. No-one even gave us water,\" she says.

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nTongue takes five wickets but India have the edge in fifth Test after day three\nWhen Ollie Pope found out he was going to lead England this week, he cheekily asked Ben Stokes if he could have the captain's suite in the team hotel. Stokes declined.\nPope probably knew he was on a hiding to nothing. This final Test against India at The Oval is the fifth time he has deputised as skipper, so Pope would also have been well aware of the biggest challenge that faces anyone who replaces Stokes as England captain - not having Stokes the all-rounder.\nThis has been a gruelling series, not helped by the condensed nature of the schedule. Bodies on both sides have been broken.\nEngland have bowled almost 315 more overs than India in the series and paid through the loss of Stokes. India have had to deal with injury problems of their own - Rishabh Pant and Nitish Kumar Reddy have gone down, while Jasprit Bumrah has been limited to only three Tests.\nWe have entered the final act. England have recent form for run chases, but knocking off 374 on this Oval pitch would be truly remarkable. \nStarting day four on 50-0 would have been a position of promise, but the loss of Zak Crawley from the penultimate delivery of day three tipped the balance further towards India ending with a 2-2 draw. \nIf they do, they will have won the two Tests Bumrah has missed. They have managed their resources better than England.\nThis video can not be played\nWill England rue six dropped catches in India's second innings?\nThe home side can point to their depleted stock of fast bowlers. Mark Wood and Olly Stone have missed the entire Test summer, young back-ups like Josh Hull and Sonny Baker have had stop-start seasons.\nBrydon Carse and Jofra Archer endured the bowlers' graveyard in the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Hindsight is glorious and, a week on, suggests it would have been wiser to save one of them for The Oval. England were going for the win that would have sealed the series and did not get it. Had they caught Ravindra Jadeja on the final day, it may have been a different story. Drops have become a recurring theme.\nOf all the pacers England could have asked to play all five Tests against India, the task was given to Chris Woakes, the oldest man in the squad. It would have been impossible to legislate for Woakes' shoulder injury, but there is also a question of whether a Brendon McCullum non-negotiable of chasing every lost cause to the boundary should apply to a weary 36-year-old fast bowler.\nIt left Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue and Jamie Overton to shoulder the burden. None of the trio shirked their responsibility, delivering a lion-hearted effort on Saturday in particular.\nAtkinson's 48.4 overs in the match and Tongue's 46 are each man's most in first-class cricket, Overton's 38 his most for three years.\nAtkinson looked back to the bowler that took Test cricket by storm last year. His performance belied any worries about a lack of cricket for the previous two months and suggests he perhaps could have played at Old Trafford. He should take the new ball for the first Ashes Test in Perth.\nTongue has had a bizarre game. Graham Gooch once said that playing New Zealand with the great Richard Hadlee in the team was like \"facing World XI at one end and Ilford 2nd XI at the other\". In the first innings at The Oval, Tongue was that in one bowler. He improved in the second and deserved his five-wicket haul, ending as England's leading wicket-taker in the series, despite only playing three Tests.\nCrawley falls late as India take upper hand\n'England should consider Brook when Stokes is out'\nEngland v India: Late Crawley wicket gives India advantage\nBetween them, Atkinson and Tongue shared 16 wickets in the fifth Test. Overton was unlucky to have three catches dropped, but did little to disprove pre-match the suspicion he was an odd pick.\nEven if the Surrey man could not have given any more, England did not need his hit-the-deck style in conditions that called for a full length. His recent history - two first-class wickets in four matches across almost two years - did not suggest he was coming in with great pedigree.\nOver the course of this summer, Overton has gone ahead of Matthew Potts and Sam Cook in the pecking order, albeit if the comparison is slightly clumsy because of their different attributes. One wonders how both Potts and Cook might have gone here. England did not see the pitch until the day before the game, by which time they were dealing with the fallout from Stokes' injury.\nPotts is centrally contracted. In the winter he played Tests against Pakistan in Multan and New Zealand in Hamilton, then disappeared. The whisper is that England have decided he is not pacey enough to be a battering ram, nor has the skills to thrive with the new ball.\nCook, so prolific in county cricket, was disappointing on Test debut against Zimbabwe in May, taking one wicket in his 31 overs. If that was his only chance to impress, he chose a bad time to have a bad game. It would be harsh if England have judged him on that alone.\nIf England have indeed gone cool on Potts and Cook, who else could they have turned to? Ollie Robinson is blacklisted and injured anyway. Calling up Dan Worrall would have sent Australia into meltdown. A 43-year-old retired James Anderson? Perhaps Overton was the best of limited options.\nThis video can not be played\nTongue takes five-for as India set England 374 runs to win\nThe managing of resources is a lesson for an Ashes series from November that will be just as relentless as this one.\nEngland have to get their bowlers to Perth, then nurse them around Australia. Woakes is a serious doubt, Stokes is battling to be fit and Wood has had a setback in his recovery from knee surgery. England will be keeping everything crossed that Archer, Carse, Atkinson and Tongue can get through the next three months of white-ball cricket - both in this country and New Zealand in October - unscathed.\nOnce in Australia, England will have to balance the desire for a good start against the need to stay the course. The final three Tests are back-to-back.\nThere have been other Ashes pointers this week. Bar Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley, England's batters struggled against the movement they can expect to face down under.\nJoe Root was rattled by words from Prasidh Krishna, yet will surely have to endure worse from the Australians. David Warner fired shots for his old team-mates on Saturday, following chirp from Steve Smith and Nathan Lyon.\nEngland will not win in Australia if they do not take their catches, so the six drops in the second innings of the fifth Test are a huge concern. One of them, by sub fielder Liam Dawson, is the sort of thing that will count against his chances of going as the second spinner. Jamie Smith looked tired behind the stumps after his first five-Test series as a keeper. Another in the heat of Australia awaits.\nBefore then, England's supreme run-chasers face the challenge of pulling off their greatest pursuit.\nThey will head to Australia on the back of a stunning victory, or with the regret of a missed opportunity for a series win.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nIndia win dramatic final Test by six runs to clinch series draw\nIt was a series for the ages. The best in the UK since 2005? It's hard to argue.\nFor the first time since 2004 the game went into the fifth day in all five Tests in the series, leaving players on both sides to summon energy from their depths.\nFrom England there was so much good before they ultimately fell short of winning a five-Test series for the first time since 2018.\nThe result is a squad that will remain largely settled going forward to the Ashes in Australia in November. There will not, and should not, be wholesale changes. \nSome have pushed their case but there remains a feeling that others could have done more.\nHere's how we rated the 16 players England used across the series. You can share your verdict in the comments below.\nBen Duckett: The opener's 149 to set up victory in the first Test was an all-timer of a knock. That he reached 12 in all but one of his eight innings afterwards yet did not make another century was disappointing. Still, given he provides fast starts, is the consistent run-getter in England's opening partnership and is growing as an influential leader who will take the fight to Australia, Duckett remains one of England's most important players. 7\nZak Crawley: The right-hander ended the series with no hundreds and an average of 32.22, effectively matching that of his 59-Test career. It means calls for England to move him on will not go away. That remains highly unlikely, however. Captain Ben Stokes and the management regularly pointed to the partnerships he shared with Duckett - 188 in the fourth innings at Headingley, 166 at Manchester and 92 at The Oval - and still believe he is best suited to the pacey, bouncy pitches in Australia. After all of the backing, it would be a massive call to change now. 5 \nOllie Pope: Similarly, this was the most Pope of series, with 106 in his first innings and only one fifty afterwards. The discrepancy between his record in the first and second innings - 46.7 compared to 19.8 - remains a concern and did not improve against India. His place is in more doubt because of how highly England rate Bethell but Pope is more likely than not to remain at number three. His captaincy in Stokes' absence at The Oval was uninspiring. 5\nJoe Root: 537 runs, three centuries and an average of 67.1. Thankfully for England, Root shows no sign of slowing down. For them to have a chance in Australia, Root will surely have to score his first Test ton down under. 9\nThis video can not be played\nSiraj bowls Crawley for 14 with the last delivery of day three\nHarry Brook: Two hundreds and a 99 make this Brook's best home summer. Another banker for the Ashes. England will need him at his best. 8\nBen Stokes: Stokes back bowling at full tilt, taking 17 wickets across 140 overs, was the biggest plus of England's summer. Their captain's 141 at Old Trafford was also welcome and will quieten any talk of a batting decline. The Oval defeat showed how crucial his captaincy and leadership remains and 34-year-old is confident he will be fit from his shoulder injury to play a full part in Australia. If he's not, England have no chance. 9\nJamie Smith: Smith's 184 not out in the second Test at Edgbaston was arguably the knock of the series. It showed why England rate him so highly. Concerning, though, was how his summer tailed off with scores of eight, nine, eight and two in his final four innings. He looked tired physically and mentally at The Oval where he failed to take England over the line on the fifth morning. Australia could be even harder on body and mind. 7\nChris Woakes: Woakes deserves a 10 for his bravery in batting in a sling during the Oval finale alone. It should endear a double World Cup winner and modern-day stalwart even further to the English sporting public. There are caveats - the flat pitches and the fact he was the only England bowler to play in all five Tests - but 11 wickets at an average of 52.1 hinted at a bowler coming towards the end. His shoulder injury could yet rule him out of Australia but England may have moved on anyway. 6\nThis video can not be played\n'Here he comes!' - Woakes comes out to bat with arm in sling\nBrydon Carse: Nine wickets at 60.9 across four matches does not reflect how well Carse bowled at times in his first home summer as a Test cricketer. He was England's best seamer in the first two Tests and his two wickets in the second innings at Lord's broke open the game. He will have a big part to play this winter. 7\nJosh Tongue: Tongue's series is the hardest to evaluate. Despite playing in only three Tests, he ended up as England's highest wicket-taker with 19. That flatters him a little, although more of his wickets were top-order dismissals than lower-order by the series' end - a reversal of his return at the start. He bowled one of the most wayward spells in recent memory in the first innings at The Oval but England will focus on the positives, such as his five-wicket haul in the second. While not a starter, he will be a part of the Ashes bowling group. 6\nShoaib Bashir: Bashir took 10 expensive wickets before breaking a finger in the third Test at Lord's. In truth, the best two Tests for him were probably those he missed. Liam Dawson did not take his chance in his place at Old Trafford and Jacob Bethell's spin is not good enough to pass as more than part-time. It may be England return to Bashir after all because, although he leaks runs, no spinner since Graeme Swann has taken wickets more regularly. 6 \nJofra Archer: Archer's return was the other big plus for England this summer. After a four-year absence he returned at Lord's and did not look like he had been away. Five wickets there were followed by four more at Old Trafford. Had Root not dropped Ravindra Jadeja off his bowling in the second innings in Manchester, England may have won the series. Fly him to Perth bubble wrapped with Special Delivery. 8\nThis video can not be played\nTongue takes five-for as India set England 374 runs to win\nLiam Dawson: Dawson could have forced England's hand at Old Trafford by taking wickets in Bashir's absence but managed only one in 62 overs. If you expected differently, you probably had not been watching closely enough. Dawson is a steady and accurate spinner but is not one to run through batting line-ups or bowl magic deliveries. That means him and England's Test team do not feel a natural fit. 4\nGus Atkinson: Eight wickets at The Oval after a frustrating, injury-hit summer were timely for Atkinson. Others - Carse and Archer in particular - had caught the eye in recent months but the Surrey quick reminded England just how dependable he is. Accurate and capable of conjuring wickets from nowhere, Atkinson should take the new ball in the first Ashes Test. 7\nJacob Bethell: This score appears harsh on a supremely talented 21-year-old asked to play in a red-hot finale on the back of one first-class game in seven months. Scores of six and five, including a poor second-innings dismissal, were a reflection of that preparation. England's faith will not be dimmed, however. He will go to Australia and could yet put some pressure on Pope with white-ball runs against South Africa in September. 3\nJamie Overton: Overton is a favourite of coach Brendon McCullum but his selection for the fifth Test was a poor one. While he improved and had catches off his bowling dropped, his hit-the-deck style was not suited to the pitch. He gains a point for the way he kept running in with Woakes injured but loses one for not sealing the win having been picked, in part at least, for his batting. 5\nThough they have white-ball matches against South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand, England do not play another Test before their Ashes opener on 21 November.\nWe asked the Test Match Special team who they would pick for that first match down under...\nBBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew: Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith, Atkinson, Carse, Archer, Wood.\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith, Atkinson, Archer, Wood, Carse/Tongue.\nEx-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent: Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith, Atkinson, Archer, Wood, Bashir.\nFormer England captain Sir Alastair Cook: Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith, Wood, Archer, Carse, Atkinson.\nEx-England spinner Phil Tufnell: Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith, Atkinson, Archer, Wood, Carse/Tongue.\nBBC chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt: Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes, Smith, Atkinson, Archer, Wood, Bashir.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The Keeladi village in India's southern Tamil Nadu state has unearthed archeological finds that have sparked a political and historical battle.\nAmid coconut groves, a series of 15ft (4.5m) deep trenches reveal ancient artefacts buried in layers of soil - fragments of terracotta pots, and traces of long-lost brick structures.\nExperts from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology estimate the artefacts to be 2,000 to 2,500 years old, with the oldest dating back to around 580 BCE. They say these findings challenge and reshape existing narratives about early civilisation in the Indian subcontinent.\nWith politicians, historians, and epigraphists weighing in, Keeladi has moved beyond archaeology, becoming a symbol of state pride and identity amid competing historical narratives.\nYet history enthusiasts say it remains one of modern India's most compelling and accessible discoveries - offering a rare opportunity to deepen our understanding of a shared past.\nKeeladi, a village 12km (7 miles) from Madurai on the banks of the Vaigai river, was one of 100 sites shortlisted for excavation by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) archaeologist Amarnath Ramakrishnan in 2013. \nHe selected a 100-acre site there because of its proximity to ancient Madurai and the earlier discovery of red-and-black pottery ware by a schoolteacher in 1975.\nSince 2014, 10 excavation rounds at Keeladi have uncovered over 15,000 artefacts - burial urns, coins, beads, terracotta pipes and more - from just four of the 100 marked acres. Many are now displayed in a nearby museum.\nAjay Kumar, leading the state archaeology team at Keeladi, says the key finds are elaborate brick structures and water systems - evidence of a 2,500-year-old urban settlement.\n\"This was a literate, urban society where people had separate spaces for habitation, burial practices and industrial work,\" Mr Kumar says, noting it's the first large, well-defined ancient urban settlement found in southern India.\nSince the Indus Valley Civilisation's discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilisation's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.\nSo, the Keeladi finds have sparked excitement across Tamil Nadu and beyond.\nWilliam Daniel, a teacher from neighbouring Kerala, said the discoveries made him feel proud about his heritage.\n\"It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilisation is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],\" he says.\nThe politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep-rooted north-south divide - underscoring how understanding the present requires grappling with the past.\nIndia's first major civilisation - the Indus Valley - emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 and 1300 BCE. After its decline, a second urban phase, the Vedic period, rose in the Gangetic plains, lasting until the 6th Century BCE.\nThis phase saw major cities, powerful kingdoms and the rise of Vedic culture - a foundation for Hinduism. As a result, urbanisation in ancient India is often viewed as a northern phenomenon, with a dominant narrative that the northern Aryans \"civilised\" the Dravidian south.\nThis is especially evident in the mainstream understanding of the spread of literacy. \nIt is believed that the Ashokan Brahmi script - found on Mauryan king Ashoka's rock edicts in northern and central India, dating back to the 3rd Century BCE - is the predecessor of most scripts in South and Southeast Asia.\nEpigraphists like Iravatham Mahadevan and Y Subbarayalu have long held the view that the Tamil Brahmi script - the Tamil language spoken in Tamil Nadu and written in the Brahmi script -  was an offshoot of the Ashokan Brahmi script.\nBut now, archaeologists from the Tamil Nadu state department say that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative.\n\"We have found graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Ashokan Brahmi script. We believe that both scripts developed independently and, perhaps, emerged from the Indus Valley script,\" Mr Kumar says.\nEpigraphist S Rajavelu, former professor of marine archaeology at the Tamil University, agrees with Mr Kumar and says other excavation sites in the state too have unearthed graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE.\nBut some experts say that more research and evidence are needed to conclusively prove the antiquity of the Tamil Brahmi script.\nAnother claim by the state department of archaeology that has ruffled feathers is that the graffiti found on artefacts in Keeladi is similar to that found in the Indus Valley sites.\n\"People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to a period of urbanisation taking place in Keeladi at the same time it was taking place in the Gangetic plains,\" Mr Kumar says, adding that further excavations are needed to fully grasp the settlement's scale.\nBut Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible.\n\"Considering the rudimentary state of travel back then, people from the Indus Valley would not have been able to migrate to the south in such large numbers to set up civilisation,\" he says. He believes the finds in Keeladi can be likened to a small \"settlement\".\nWhile archaeologists debate the findings, politicians are already drawing links between Keeladi and the Indus Valley - some even claim the two existed at the same time or that the Indus Valley was part of an early southern Indian, or Dravidian, civilisation.\nThe controversy over ASI archaeologist Mr Ramakrishnan's transfer - who led the Keeladi excavations - has intensified the site's political tensions.\nIn 2017, after two excavation rounds, the ASI transferred Mr Ramakrishnan, citing protocol. The Tamil Nadu government accused the federal agency of deliberately hindering the digs to undermine Tamil pride.\nThe ASI's request in 2023 for Mr Ramakrishnan to revise his Keeladi report - citing a lack of scientific rigour - has intensified the controversy. He refused, insisting his findings followed standard archaeological methods.\nIn June, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin called the federal government's refusal to publish Mr Ramakrishnan's report an \"onslaught on Tamil culture and pride\". State minister Thangam Thennarasu accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal government of deliberately suppressing information to erase Tamilian history.\nIndia's Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has now clarified that Mr Ramakrishnan's report has not been rejected by the ASI but is \"under review,\" with expert feedback yet to be finalised.\nBack at the the Keeladi museum, children explore exhibits during a school visit while construction continues outside to create an open-air museum at the excavation site.\nJournalist Sowmiya Ashok, author of an upcoming book on Keeladi, recalls the thrill of her first visit.\n\"Uncovering history is a journey to better understand our shared past. Through small clues - like carnelian beads from the northwest or Roman copper coins - Keeladi reveals that our ancestors were far more connected than we realise,\" she says. \n\"The divisions we see today are shaped more by the present than by history.\"\n",

Ancient site stirs heated political debate on India's past2 days agoShareSaveCherylann MollanBBC NewsReporting fromKeeladi, Tamil NaduShareSaveASIA view of an excavated site in Keeladi where archaeologists have found evidence of industrial activityThe Keeladi village in India's southern Tamil Nadu state has unearthed archeological finds that have sparked a political and historical battle.Amid coconut groves, a series of 15ft (4.5m) deep trenches reveal ancient artefacts buried in layers of soil - fragments of terracotta pots, and traces of long-lost brick structures.Experts from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology estimate the artefacts to be 2,000 to 2,500 years old, with the oldest dating back to around 580 BCE. \"This was a literate, urban society where people had separate spaces for habitation, burial practices and industrial work,\" Mr Kumar says, noting it's the first large, well-defined ancient urban settlement found in southern India.Since the Indus Valley Civilisation's discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilisation's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.So, the Keeladi finds have sparked excitement across Tamil Nadu and beyond.William Daniel, a teacher from neighbouring Kerala, said the discoveries made him feel proud about his heritage. He believes the finds in Keeladi can be likened to a small \"settlement\".Keeladi MuseumPipes made of terracota were used to transport waterWhile archaeologists debate the findings, politicians are already drawing links between Keeladi and the Indus Valley - some even claim the two existed at the same time or that the Indus Valley was part of an early southern Indian, or Dravidian, civilisation.The controversy over ASI archaeologist Mr Ramakrishnan's transfer - who led the Keeladi excavations - has intensified the site's political tensions.In 2017, after two excavation rounds, the ASI transferred Mr Ramakrishnan, citing protocol.",

She recalls in her memoir hearing a colleague frantically call out to her, asking her to rush to the casualty ward.\nThere, lying on a gurney was the very woman who had selected Dr Bhargava to head the hospital - Indira Gandhi. Her saffron sari was drenched in blood and she had no pulse.\n\"At the time, I didn't focus on it being the prime minister who was lying in front of me,\" Dr Bhargava told the BBC. \"My first thoughts were that we had to help her and also protect her from further harm,\" she said.\nDr Bhargava was worried that a mob would storm the casualty ward, as a large crowd had already begun gathering outside the hospital. \nNews began to trickle out: Gandhi had been shot by two Sikh bodyguards in revenge for Operation Blue Star, the military raid on Amritsar's Golden Temple in June to flush out militants.\nGandhi's assassination sparked one of the deadliest riots India has seen, the beginnings of which Dr Bhargava began hearing about as she hastened to shift the prime minister to one of the building's top floors.\nThere, in the operating theatre, a Sikh doctor fled the room the minute he heard how Gandhi had died.\nThe news of her death had to be kept under wraps until her son, Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as prime minister.\n\"Until then, our job, for the next four hours, was to keep up the charade that we were trying to save her life, when in fact she was dead when she was brought to AIIMS,\" Dr Bhargava writes.\nShe also described the harrowing process of embalming the prime minister's body, which would lie in state in the capital for two days before cremation.\n\"The embalming chemical, when we injected it into different main arteries, kept oozing out,\" Dr Bhargava writes. A ballistic report would later reveal that over three dozen bullets had punctured Gandhi's body.\nBut this wasn't the only remarkable episode in Dr Bhargava's long and illustrious career at AIIMS.\nIn the book she shares fascinating anecdotes of her interactions with other prominent politicians, including India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\nShe also recalls Sonia Gandhi bringing her son, a young Rahul to AIIMS after an arrow grazed his head while he was playing.\n\"Sonia Gandhi told me that she had to bring Rahul to us because Rajiv (her husband) was meeting the King of Jordan and the latter had given him a fancy car as a gift, which her husband was keen to drive,\" she writes in the book.\nRajiv Gandhi wanted to drive Rahul to AIIMS himself, without security, as a surprise - but Dr Bhargava firmly stopped him, citing safety concerns.\nBut not every day was as exciting.\nDr Bhargava recalls political pressure, including an MP who threatened her for not selecting his son-in-law for a job at AIIMS.\nOn another occasion, two top politicians, including the federal health secretary, tried to handpick the AIIMS dean - though the decision was hers alone.\nDr Bhargava says she stood firm against pressure, always prioritising patient care. She worked to establish radiology as a core part of diagnosis and treatment at AIIMS.\nWhen Dr Bhargava joined in the 1960s, AIIMS had only basic imaging tools. She trained colleagues to read subtle signs in black-and-white X-rays, always in context with the patient's history. She later pushed for better equipment, helping build one of India's leading radiology departments.\n\nDr Bhargava was always drawn to making a difference. \nBorn in 1930 into an affluent family in Lahore in undivided India, as a child she loved playing doctor to her dolls and siblings. During the partition of India and Pakistan, Dr Bhargava's family fled to India and later, she would visit refugee camps with her father to help people.\nAt a time when few Indian women pursued higher education, Dr Bhargava studied radiology in London - the only woman in both her class and hospital department.\nShe returned to India in the 1950s after hearing from her mentor that the country was in need of skilled radiologists.\nDr Bhargava often credits her family, and her husband's liberal-mindedness for helping her achieve her dreams, and she hopes other Indian women find the same support.\n\"It starts from childhood,\" she says. \n\"Parents should support their daughters the same way they support their sons.

It speaks to the refinement of our mission, the harmony of science and spirit, and the unmerited favour we carry with humility.\"\nThe name, she added, was a reminder \"that spaceflight is not just a feat of engineering, but an act of goodwill - for the benefit of every human, everywhere\".",

The investigation is ongoing.\nManju Mahesh Patel, 79, was one of the 260 people killed - most of whom were passengers - when the London-bound plane fell into a densely populated neighbourhood in the western Indian city.\nHer granddaughter found reading the report \"quite heartbreaking\", as there were images from the immediate aftermath of the crash - including the wreckage - that were difficult to process. \n\"For me, I can't sort of stop thinking about what my grandma's final moments must have looked like,\" she said from her home in Buckinghamshire.\nMs Patel's grandmother had been staying in Ahmedabad for the prior few months, carrying out charity work at a temple. Manju's son had been due pick her up at Gatwick that night, and she was said to be looking forward to seeing her four grandchildren in the UK.\n\"This was the chance to reconnect with her after 10 years,\" Ms Patel said. \"Knowing that we won't be able to see her again, it is really tough.\"\nData gathered from inside the plane suggests both of its fuel control switches moved from the \"run\" to the \"cut-off\" position in the space of a second shortly after take-off.\nThese switches are typically only turned off when a plane has landed and made it to the gate, or during emergency situations. India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not specify whether an emergency situation had taken place on board in its preliminary report. \nThe cut-off then caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report found.\nFor Ms Patel, the preliminary report still points to several theories and its findings are incomplete.\nBut she stressed how \"extremely important\" it was for her and others to find out what the underlying cause of the crash was.\n\"I feel like I can't really be at peace with what's happened, unless I understand where the accountability lies.\"\nSameer Rafik, a cousin of crash victim Faizan Rafik, is similarly calling for more details to be brought forward. \n\"The Indian Government should release the cockpit audio for the families who lost loved ones,\" he said.

In-play video clips and text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer and BBC Two each night.\nThis is, in every sense, it.\nBazball. Pensioning off James Anderson. Ben Stokes' knee. Ben Stokes' hamstring. The Raid of Rawalpindi and the Heist of Hyderabad. One run in Wellington. The moral Ashes and enough rounds of golf to forge a major champion.\nAll leading to this.\nTen Tests - five against India now and five against Australia in the winter - the difference between this England team being remembered as ideological entertainers, glorious winners, or both.\nStokes, the captain, has a place in history assured. Further success between now and January would strengthen his claim as England's greatest cricketer of all time. Coach Brendon McCullum could quit today and still go down as the man that resuscitated the England team. Now he has the opportunity to take some of the biggest prizes back to his stables in New Zealand.\nThere is every chance both are still in charge this time next year \u2013 McCullum is contracted until 2027 anyway \u2013 but also an alternative outcome that sees the end of both. In the story arc we have reached the Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows, the finale of which will determine the appetite for a Cursed Child stage show.\nTalk of a \"defining period\" will not seep into the dressing room. Stokes famously told Jofra Archer \"today doesn't define you\" before he bowled the super over in the 2019 World Cup final. On a human level, how many of us would want to be judged on a six-month period at work?\n\"I don't tend to worry myself about what other people are going to say about what I've done as a captain at the end of it,\" said Stokes.\n\"Since I've done this role I've done it wholeheartedly and thrown everything I possibly have into doing it, both on the field and off the field. That's all I can really control. The results will be the results and hopefully we'll have more in favour than not.\"\nPope, Bumrah, Bashir - how England v India will be won and lost\n'Woakes return more important than ever to England'\nEngland dropping Pope would be 'remarkable' - Stokes\nStill, there is an inescapable truth that some parts of professional sport are more important than others. Some days, matches and series are bigger. The series against India, starting in sun-kissed Leeds on Friday, is bigger.\nIt is an English cricketing disease to look at everything in the context of the Ashes. Contests against Australia tend to cement legacies, shape futures and create the longest memories.\nThe best way for England to arrive in Perth in November in the strongest possible shape is to defeat India, though even framing it like that feels disrespectful to the biggest cricketing juggernaut on the planet.\nEngland and Australia may have a longer shared history, but India are in a league of their own in terms of power, attention and scrutiny. Their presence in this country over the next seven weeks, free of competing for oxygen with Premier League football, is a headline act in the sporting summer.\nEngland are a very good Test team, though probably not quite as good as they should be. They have won four and lost four of their past eight matches. Three of those defeats, by Sri Lanka at The Oval, Pakistan in Rawalpindi and New Zealand in Hamilton, were incredibly loose performances.\nIt is the sloppiness that frustrates supporters, made all the more infuriating by the knowledge of how good England can be at their best.\nRecent messaging - Stokes and McCullum talking about their team being \"smarter\" - suggests England have listened and learned. Time will tell.\nThis video can not be played\n'It would be remarkable to choose someone over Pope'\nIn terms of personnel, Ollie Pope v Jacob Bethell was the biggest conversation around an England number three since Ashley Cole left Arsenal for Chelsea. Stokes claimed it was never in doubt he would stick with Pope, so now Pope has to repay the faith.\nThe home side's fast bowling is down to the bare bones and a potential area of weakness in what could be superb batting conditions. Reinforcements are hopefully on the way. Gus Atkinson trained on Wednesday and Archer is set to play for Sussex on Sunday, the latest stage in England's yearn for his return like Vladimir and Estragon waiting for Godot.\nTypically, the spotlight may again fall on Stokes. For all of the effort the all-rounder has put into being fit to bowl, England probably need his runs more than his overs.\nStokes has not made a Test hundred since the near-miracle against Australia at Lord's in 2023, averaging below 30 in the process. He has batted only once in any kind of professional cricket in seven months. Headingley, for obvious reasons, might be the place to spark inspiration.\nHow does new captain Gill compare to India batting greats?\nWin in England bigger than IPL - India captain Gill \nNair's long road back to India team, via Northampton\nFor once, Stokes is not the biggest box-office draw. India's Jasprit Bumrah is the leading cricketer on the planet right now, compiling a career that will stack up against any fast bowler to have played the game. How England survive his staccato approach and educated fingers will go a long way to deciding the series.\nEvery spell from Bumrah \u2013 and he may only play three Tests \u2013 will be must-watch, just like the middle-order pyrotechnics of India wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. England spinner Shoaib Bashir will have to hold his nerve when Pant attempts to hit him out of Yorkshire.\nBumrah and Pant are familiar faces in an unfamiliar India side, led for the first time by Shubman Gill. After the retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin, India are evolving, albeit with no shortage of talent from their vast reserves.\nThe absence of Kohli in particular means there is a little less stardust, though not necessarily a diminished chance of India success. Kohli's returns in Test cricket had gradually dropped up to his retirement last month and the jury is out on whether India are weaker without him. They never won a series in this country with him in the team.\nIt is that difficulty for visiting teams to win here \u2013 India have not done so since 2007 \u2013 that has England starting as favourites to complete the first part of what would be an epic double.\nFor all of the highs of the Stokes-McCullum regime \u2013 and there have been plenty \u2013 they are still to tick off victory in a marquee five-Test series.\nA comparison can be made to a decade ago, when England last held simultaneous sway over India and Australia. Back then, their cricket under coach Andy Flower was notoriously dry, the dressing room mentality rarely shifting from siege. Yet, they were winners.\nThis England team can have it all. The entertainment, the glory, even the golf.\nFor the Old Trafford rain and Stuart Broad's bails. For Jonny Bairstow's runs and Jonny Bairstow's broken leg. For Moeen Ali's finger and Ollie Robinson's podcast. For Dan Lawrence opening the batting and 823-7 in Multan. For Joe Root's records and Mark Wood's rockets. For Bazball.\nThis is it.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Many are struggling to stay in the business, while others complain about a drop in the quality of the produce, causing them huge losses.\nMs Begum's family has been cultivating paddy - a highly water-intensive crop - for decades on their one-acre land (4046 sq m) in Chersoo village.\nBut they haven't had a single batch of healthy harvest in the last five years, as rains have become progressively more erratic, she said. \n\"This summer, it feels like our worst fears have come true,\" she added. \"We have nothing left.\"\nAccording to a 2021 study, the maximum temperature in the Kashmir rose by 2C between 1980 and 2020, indicating an average rise of 0.5C rise per decade. \nMukhtar Ahmad, head of the Indian weather department's centre in Srinagar city, said the region had already witnessed three heatwaves this season, causing major rivers and streams to dry up.\nThe signs of damage were visible everywhere. \nIn Bandipore district, rows of wilted apple trees dot Ali Mohammad's 15-acre field.\nTwenty years ago, he decided to turn land, where he grew paddy, into an apple orchard because he felt the weather and water supplies had become too unreliable for growing rice.\nBut now, even his apple crop - which typically requires less water - is struggling to survive.\n\"The orchards need water at least three times a month, but for the last two months there was no rain and the irrigation canals dried up,\" he said.\nThe scorching heat has also taken a toll on residents, who are unaccustomed to living in such high temperatures.\n\"I have never witnessed such an intense heatwave in my life,\" said 63-year-old Parveez Ahmad, who lives in northern Kashmir.\nA few days ago, Mr Ahmad had to be rushed to the hospital after he complained of severe breathlessness.\n\"The doctors told me it was caused by the heat and humidity,\" he said.\nEnvironmentalists say that climate change has been impacting the region, causing extreme weather events and prolonged dry spells in both winter and summer.\nLast year, the snow-clad mountains in the region stayed oddly brown and barren for months, after a prolonged delay in the annual snowfall.\nWhile warmer winters have led to reduced snowfall, hotter summers have sped up the melting of glaciers, disrupting the availability of water and putting human health and crops at risk, said Mohammad Farooq Azam, a glaciologist and hydrologist.\n\"These trends are not just seasonal anomalies - they represent a systemic shift that could have long-term consequences for water security, agriculture and biodiversity in Kashmir,\" Mr Azam added.\nMr Azam explained that most of Kashmir's winter rain and snow come from western disturbances - storms that form over the Mediterranean and move eastward. But these systems have become weaker and less frequent, leading to reduced snowfall and delays in snowmelt.\n\"This exposes the bare ground sooner than usual, which absorbs more heat. As glaciers shrink and snow cover reduces, the land reflects less sunlight and traps more heat, making the region even warmer,\" he said.\nJasia Bashir, a professor at the Islamic University of Science and Technology in Awantipora district, points out that Kashmir contributes very little to global carbon emissions, as it has limited industry and relies mostly on agriculture and tourism.\nYet, the region is being hit hard by climate change - making it a victim of a crisis it played little part in creating, she said.\n\"This tells you how climate change is a global phenomenon, not restricted to any particular region.\"\nThat said, the region has also witnessed rapid urbanisation in recent years.\nVast farmlands and forests have been replaced with concrete buildings, reducing the region's ability to naturally regulate the local climate.\nAccording to a report by Global Forest Watch (GFW), the wider Jammu and Kashmir region lost nearly 0.39% of its total tree cover between 2001 and 2023 due to deforestation and forest fires.\nIn addition, government figures reveal that more than 600,000 trees have been felled in Kashmir over the last five years after being identified as river encroachments.\nMs Bashir said urban areas of Kashmir were also experiencing higher energy demands, especially for air conditioners, which has increased the greenhouse gas emissions.\n\"This sets off a vicious cycle: rising temperatures lead to greater energy use, which fuels more emissions and further warming,\" she added.\nCritics say that despite the growing risks, environmental issues rarely make headlines and are still not a priority for Kashmir's politicians.\nTanvir Sadiq, the spokesperson for the region's elected government, denied this and said the administration was taking the problem of climate change \"very seriously\".\n\"Climate change is a global phenomenon and the government alone cannot tackle it,\" he added. \"Still, we are exploring all available options to minimise its impact on the people.\"\nBut for farmers like Ms Begum, any action must happen quickly.\n\"Otherwise, we will be doomed,\" she said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "India's showpiece software industry is facing a moment of reckoning.\nThe country's biggest private sector employer Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - also its largest IT services company - has announced it will cut more than 12,000 jobs at middle and senior management levels. This will reduce the firm's workforce by 2%.\nThe Mumbai-headquartered software behemoth employs over half-a-million IT workers and is considered a bellwether for business sentiment across India's $283bn software industry. It forms the backbone of formal, white-collar employment in the country.\nThe decision, TCS says, was taken to make the company \"future ready\" as it invests in new areas and deploys artificial intelligence at scale amid seismic disruptions in its traditional business model.\nCompanies like TCS have, for decades, relied on cheap skilled labour to produce software for global clients at lower costs, but this has been upended by AI automating tasks and clients demanding more innovative solutions, rather than just cost savings on manpower.\n\"A number of re-skilling and redeployment initiatives have been under way,\" TCS said in a statement, adding it will be \"releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible\".\n\"Across IT companies, people managers are being let go while the doers are being kept to rationalise the workforce and bring in efficiencies,\"  Neeti Sharma, CEO of staffing firm TeamLease Digital told the BBC. \nShe added that \"there's been a massive spike\" in emerging tech hiring in areas such as AI, cloud, data security, but it is not at the same intensity at which people are being fired.\nTCS's announcement also highlights the sharp \"skills mismatch\" in the country's software industry, experts say.\nAs generative AI leads to a rapid enhancement of productivity, \"this technology shift is forcing businesses to reassess their workforce structure and analyse if resources should be redirected toward roles that complement AI capabilities,\" Rishi Shah, economist with Grant Thornton Bharat told the BBC.\nAccording to the industry body Nasscom, India needs a million AI professionals by 2026, but not even 20% of the country's IT professionals are AI-skilled. \nWhile up-skilling spends by tech companies have significantly spiked as they rush to prepare a new pool of AI talent for the future, those without the requisite skills are being shown the door. \nBesides the structural shifts brought about by the advent of AI, TCS's announcement also \"reflects the broader growth challenges being faced by India's IT sector\", according to global investment banking firm Jeffries.\n\"Aggregate net hiring at industry level has been weak since FY22 [financial year 2022], mainly due to the prolonged moderation in demand outlook,\" Jeffries said in a note.\nDemand for IT services in the US \u2013 which contributes to half of the revenue for Indian software majors - has been impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs.\nWhile tariffs chiefly target physical goods, analysts say companies are pausing on discretionary IT spending as they reconsider the economic impact of tariff uncertainties and their global sourcing strategies.\nRising AI adoption is also driving US companies to negotiate lower costs, forcing people heavy IT firms to work with fewer employees, according to Jeffries.\nThe ripple effects of this have begun to be felt in cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune \u2013 once epicentres of India's IT boom. Some 50,000 people in the industry lost their jobs last year, according to one estimate. And there was a 72% drop in net employee additions at India's top six IT services companies.\nAll of this could have cascading effects on India's broader economy, which has struggled to create jobs for the millions of young graduates that enter the workforce every year.\nIn the absence of a strong manufacturing sector, these software companies - which made India the world's back office in the 1990s - were the preferred employment option for hundreds of thousands of new IT workers. They birthed a new, affluent middle class, spawning growth in many cities and fueling demand for cars and homes.\nBut as stable, well-paying jobs shrink, there are now questions over India's services-led economic boom.\nUntil just a few years ago, India's IT majors would absorb 600,000 fresh graduates every year. In the last two years, that number has dramatically fallen to about 150,000, according to TeamLease Digital.\nOther emerging sectors such as financial technology startups and GCCs (global capability centres) \u2013 which are off-shore units of multinational companies that perform supporting tasks like IT, finance or research and development - are absorbing the rest, but at least \"20-25% of fresh graduates will have no jobs,\" says Ms Sharma.\nShe adds that the \"GCCs will never match the volume of hiring that the IT companies did\".\nSeveral top business leaders in India have begun flagging the economic consequences of these trends.\nIndia's trimmed down IT sector could \"negatively impact many allied services and industries, crash real estate and give a big blow to premium consumption,\" D Muthukrishnan, one of south India's largest distributor of mutual-funds wrote on X, reacting to TCS's announcement. \nA few months ago Arindam Paul, entrepreneur and founder of the motor technology company Atomberg, warned of the potentially crippling impact of AI on India's middle class in a LinkedIn post. \n\"Almost 40-50% white collar jobs that exist today might cease to exist,\" Paul wrote. \"And that would mean the end of the middle class and the consumption story.\" \nHow quickly Indian tech giants adapt to the gamut of disruptions being brought by the AI revolution will decide whether the country can retain its edge as a global technology player. And whether it can expand its consuming middle-class that can keep its GDP growth on track.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

It will detect changes and land, ice, or coastal shifts as small as centimetres, says Ms Mitra.\nRepeated scans will generate rich data, helping Nasa and Isro ground stations support disaster preparedness and track climate change impacts, she added.\nScientists say Earth's surface is constantly changing due to natural and human activities, and even small shifts can impact the planet.\n\"Some of these changes happen slowly, some abruptly, some are small while some are subtle,\" Nasa's director of Earth Sciences Karen St Germain, who is in India for the launch, told a pre-launch press conference.\n\"With Nisar, we'll see the precursors to natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides and volcanoes; we'll see land subsidence and swelling, movements and deformations, melting of glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica; and we'll see forest fires.\n\"We'll also be able to spot human-induced land changes caused by farming and infrastructure projects such as buildings and bridges,\" she said.\nThe satellite will take 90 days to fully deploy and will start collecting data once tests on all its systems are complete. \nThe $1.5bn joint mission, over a decade in the making, features India's payload, rocket, and launch-pad facilities.\nNasa's St Germain said the satellite was special as it was built by scientists \"who were at the opposite ends of the globe during the Covid-19 pandemic\".  \nIsro chairman V Narayanan told NDTV news channel that the \"life-saving satellite\" is a symbol of India's rising leadership in space. Talking about Wednesday's launch, he said: \"This is going to be yet another great day for India.\"\nIndian Science Minister Jitendra Singh has called the mission a defining moment in India-US space cooperation and a boost to Isro's international collaborations. \n\"Nisar is not just a satellite; it is India's scientific handshake with the world,\" the minister said.\nThe joint mission comes just weeks after astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla travelled to the International Space Station on the AX-4 mission, led by former Nasa veteran Peggy Whitson.\nIndia has been making big strides in its space programme recently. \nIn August 2023, the country made history as its Moon mission became the first to land in the lunar south pole region.

        "article_text": "In the winter of 1956, The Times correspondent David Holden arrived on the island of Bahrain, then still a British protectorate. \nAfter a short-lived career teaching geography, Holden had looked forward to his Arabian posting, but he hadn't expected to be attending a garden durbar in honour of Queen Victoria's appointment as Empress of India. \nEverywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India. \n\"The Raj maintains here a slightly phantasmal sway,\" wrote Holden, \"a situation rich in anomaly and anachronism\u2026 The servants are all bearers, the laundryman a dhobi, and the watchman a chowkidar,\" he wrote, \"and on Sundays the guests are confronted with the ancient, and agreeable, Anglo-Indian ritual of a mountainous curry lunch.\" \nThe Sultan of Oman, educated in Rajasthan, was more fluent in Urdu than Arabic, while soldiers in the nearby state of Qu'aiti, now eastern Yemen, marched around in now-defunct Hyderabadi army uniforms.\nIn the words of the governor of Aden himself: \n\"One had an extraordinarily powerful impression that all the clocks here had stopped seventy years ago; that the Raj was at its height, Victoria on the throne, Gilbert and Sullivan a fresh and revolutionary phenomenon, and Kipling a dangerous debunker, so strong was the link from Delhi via Hyderabad to the South Arabian shore.\"\nAlthough largely forgotten today, in the early 20th Century, nearly a third of the Arabian Peninsula was ruled as part of the British Indian Empire. \nFrom Aden to Kuwait, a crescent of Arabian protectorates was governed from Delhi, overseen by the Indian Political Service, policed by Indian troops, and answerable to the Viceroy of India.\nUnder the Interpretation Act of 1889, these protectorates had all legally been considered part of India. \nThe standard list of India's semi-independent princely states like Jaipur opened alphabetically with Abu Dhabi, and the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, even suggested that Oman should be treated \"as much a Native State of the Indian Empire as Lus Beyla or Kelat [present day Balochistan]\". \nIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern Yemen, which functioned as India's westernmost port and was administered as part of Bombay Province. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1931, he found many young Arabs identifying as Indian nationalists.\nEven at the time, however, few members of the British or Indian public were aware of this Arabian extension of the British Raj. \nMaps showing the full reach of the Indian Empire were only published in top secrecy, and the Arabian territories were left off public documents to avoid provoking the Ottomans or later the Saudis. \nIndeed, as one Royal Asiatic Society lecturer quipped:\n\"As a jealous sheikh veils his favourite wife, so the British authorities shroud conditions in the Arab states in such thick mystery that ill-disposed propagandists might almost be excused for thinking that something dreadful is going on there.\"\nBut by the 1920s, politics was shifting. Indian nationalists began to imagine India not as an imperial construct but as a cultural space rooted in the geography of the Mahabharata. London saw an opportunity to redraw borders. On 1 April 1937, the first of several imperial partitions was enacted and Aden was separated from India. \nA telegram from King George VI was read aloud:\n\"Aden has been an integral part of British Indian administration for nearly 100 years. That political association with my Indian Empire will now be broken, and Aden will take its place in my Colonial Empire.\"\nThe Gulf remained under the purview of the Government of India for another decade, however. \nBritish officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India.\"\nAs Gulf resident William Hay put it, \"it would clearly have been inappropriate to hand over responsibility for dealing with the Gulf Arabs to Indians or Pakistanis\". \nThe Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.\nMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. \nFew batted an eyelid, and 75 years on, the importance of what had just happened is still not fully understood in either India or the Gulf. \nWithout this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.\nWhen British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. So Britain retained its role in the Gulf for 24 more years, with an 'Arabian Raj' now reporting to Whitehall rather than to the Viceroy of India. \nIn the words of Gulf scholar Paul Rich, this was \"the Indian Empire's last redoubt, just as Goa was Portuguese India's last solitary vestige, or Pondicherry was the tag-end of French India\".\nThe official currency was still the Indian rupee; the easiest mode of transport was still the 'British India Line' (shipping company) and the 30 Arabian princely states were still governed by 'British residents' who had made their careers in the Indian Political Service.\nThe British only finally pulled out of the Gulf in 1971 as part of its decision to abandon colonial commitments east of Suez. \nAs David Holden wrote in July: \n\"For the first time since the heyday of Britain's East India Company, all the territories around the Gulf will be at liberty to seek their own salvation without the threat of British intervention, or the comfort of British protection. This final remnant of the British Raj - for that, in effect, is what it is \u2013 has been for some years now an obvious, if in some ways charming, anachronism \u2026 But its day is over.\"\nOf all the national narratives that emerged after the Empire's collapse, the Gulf states have been most successful at erasing their ties to British India. \nFrom Bahrain to Dubai, a past relationship with Britain is remembered, but governance from Delhi is not. The myth of an ancient sovereignty is crucial to keeping the monarchies alive. Yet private memories persist, particularly of the unimaginable class reversal that the Gulf has seen. \nIn 2009, Gulf scholar Paul Rich recorded an elderly Qatari gentleman who \"still got angry when he related to me the beating he received when as a young boy of seven or eight he stole an orange, a fruit which he had never seen before, from an Indian employee of the British agent\". \n\"The Indians, he said, were a privileged caste during his youth, and it gave him immense pleasure that the tables had turned and they now came to the Gulf as servants.\"\nToday Dubai, once a minor outpost of the Indian Empire with no gun salute, is the glittering centre of the new Middle East. \nFew of the millions of Indians or Pakistanis who live there know that there was a world in which India or Pakistan might have inherited the oil-rich Gulf, just as they did Jaipur, Hyderabad or Bahawalpur. \nA quiet bureaucratic decision, made in the twilight of empire, severed that link. Today, only the echoes remain.\nSam Dalrymple is the author of Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "\"Let me tell you a secret. Your nana (grandfather) helped Jewish families escape the Nazis.\"\nThat single sentence from his mother set Vinay Gupta off on a journey into his grandfather's past. What he unearthed was a tale more gripping than fiction: a little-known act of heroism by an Indian businessman who risked everything to save strangers in Europe's darkest hour.\nThis wasn't just compassion; it was logistics, risk, and resolve. Back in India, Kundanlal set up a businesses to employ Jews, built homes to house them - only to watch the British declare them as \"enemy aliens\" and detain them once World War Two broke out.\nKundanlal's life reads like an epic: a poor boy from Ludhiana, married at 13, who sold everything from timber and salt to lab gear and bullock-cart wheels. He also ran a clothing business and a matchstick factory. He topped his class in Lahore - joining the colonial civil service at 22, only to resign from it all to participate in the freedom movement and a life of building factories.\nHe shook hands with Indian independence leader and later its first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and crossed paths with actress Devika Rani on a steamer to Europe.\nIn A Rescue In Vienna, a family memoir, Gupta uncovers his grandfather's  extraordinary Indian rescue on foreign soil - pieced together through family letters, survivor interviews, and historical records.\nIn the shadow of Hitler's 1938 annexation of Austria, Kundanlal, a machine tool manufacturer from Ludhiana city in the northern state of Punjab, quietly offered Jewish professionals jobs in India to get them life-saving visas. He offered work,  provided livelihood and build homes for those families in India. \nKundanlal rescued five families.\nFritz Weiss, a 30-year-old Jewish lawyer, was hiding in a hospital, feigning illness. Kundanlal was also in the same hospital to get treatment for an illness. \nAfter Nazis forced Weiss to clean the streets outside his own home, Kundanlal handed him a lifeline: a job offer at the fictitious \"Kundan Agencies.\" It got him a visa to India.\nAlfred Wachsler, a master woodworker, met Kundanlal while bringing his pregnant wife for tests. Promised a future in furniture and a sponsor for emigration, his family became one of the Jewish households to reach India between January 1938 and February 1939. \nHans Losch, a textile technician, answered Kundanlal's advert in an Austrian paper for skilled workers. Offered a managerial role at the imaginary \"Kundan Cloth Mills\" in Ludhiana - with housing, profit share, and safe passage - he seized the chance to start over.\nAlfred Schafranek, once owner of a 50-employee plywood factory, pitched his skills to Kundanlal and was offered a role in building India's most modern plywood unit. His entire family, including his mechanic brother Siegfried, was rescued.\nAnd Siegmund Retter, a machine tools businessman, was among the first Kundanlal approached. As his business collapsed under Nazi rule, Kundanlal began arranging his move to India to start again.\nIt all began with a hospital bed in Vienna. \nStruggling with diabetes and hemorrhoids, Kundanlal, then 45, sought new treatments and read about a specialist in Vienna. In 1938, while recovering from surgery there, he met Lucy and Alfred Wachsler, a young couple expecting their first child. From them, he learned of rising antisemitic violence and the destruction of Jewish lives. \nOver the next few months, he met other men. Encouraged by this success, Kundanlal placed newspaper adverts seeking skilled workers willing to relocate to India. Among the respondents were Wachsler, Losch, Schafranek and Retter. Kundanlal offered each a job, financial guarantees, and support to secure Indian visas.\n\"A striking aspect of all of Kundanlal's elaborate scheming on behalf of these families was how close mouthed he remained, keeping up appearances of technology transfer to India until the very end,\" Gupta writes. \n\"He did not share his intent or plans with any Indian or British officials. His family learned of his plans only when he returned home months later.\" \nIn October 1938, Losch became the first of Kundanlal's recruits to arrive in Ludhiana. \nHe was welcomed into Kundanlal's home - but found little comfort in the quiet town, writes Gupta. With no Jewish community, no cultural life, and a struggling cloth mill, Losch left within weeks for Bombay (now Mumbai), citing poor working conditions and little chance of profit. He never returned.\nWeiss lasted even less - just under two months. The company created for him, Kundan Agencies, never took off. He soon moved to Bombay, found work in flooring, and by 1947 had relocated to England. \nDespite their departures, Kundanlal bore no resentment, writes Gupta.\n\"My aunt told me that on the contrary, Kundanlal had been embarrassed that he could not provide a lifestyle and social environment more suited to Vienna, and felt that if he had, the two men may have stayed on in Ludhiana.\" \nNot all stories ended this way.\nAlfred and Lucy Wachsler, with their infant son, arrived by sea, rail, and road - finally stepping off the train at Ludhiana. \nThey moved into a spacious home Kundanlal built for them next door to another, prepared for the Schafraneks. Alfred quickly set up a furniture workshop, using Burmese teak and local Sikh labour to craft elegant dining sets - one of which still survives in the author's family.\nIn March 1939, Alfred Schafranek, his brother Siegfried, and their families arrived from Austria. They launched one of India's earliest plywood factories in a shed behind the two homes. \nDriven and exacting, Alfred pushed untrained workers hard, determined to build something lasting. Gupta writes, the work was intense, the Punjab heat unfamiliar, and the isolation palpable - especially for the women, confined mostly to domestic life.\nAs the months passed in Ludhiana, the initial relief gave way to boredom. \nThe men worked long hours, while the women, limited by language and isolation, kept to household routines. \nIn September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. Days later, Britain declared war on Germany - the British parliament pulled India into the conflict. Over 2.5 million Indians would serve in the war, 87,000 never returned.\nIn Ludhiana, the reality of war hit fast. \nBy 1940, new policies ordered all German nationals - Jewish or not - into internment camps. \nThe Wachsler and Schafranek families were forcibly relocated to the Purandhar Internment Camp near Poona (now Pune), housed in bare barracks with kerosene lamps and minimal comforts. They had committed no crime - only carried the wrong passport.\nEventually, release became possible - if they could find paid work. \nAlfred and Siegfried Schafranek secured roles managing a new plywood business in Bangalore and moved there with their families, starting all over again. The Wachsler family left the camp in 1942 after Alfred found a job in Karachi. The two families never met again.\nPurandhar Camp closed in 1946, nearly a year after the war ended. \nIn 1948, Alfred Wachsler's cousin sponsored US refugee visas for the family. That October, they flew out of Karachi, never to return to India. The Schafraneks relocated to Australia in 1947 after a successful plywood venture in Bangalore.\nWhile researching the book, Gupta met Alex Wachsler - whose father, Alfred, had also built the Burmese teak desk Kundanlal once used in his tiny 120 sq ft office. (Alfred died in 1973.)\n\"Despite living in US since the age of 10, and now into his eighties, Alex Wachsler still pines for his life in India, eats at Indian restaurants, delights in meeting Indians and surprises them with his knowledge of Urdu,\" writes Gupta.\nBack in Ludhiana, Kundanlal opened a school for his daughters at home, soon expanding it into one of Punjab's oldest schools - still running today with 900 students. His wife, Saraswati, grew increasingly withdrawn and battled depression.\nKundanlal and Saraswati had five children, including four daughters. In 1965, Saraswati died after a tragic fall from their terrace. She spent her final years in silence, emotionally distanced from the family. Kundanlal passed away a year later, aged 73, from a heart attack. \n\"The notion of a 'passive bystander' was anathema to Kundanlal. If he saw something, or someone, that required attention, he attended to it, never intimidated by the enormity of the problem,\" writes Gupta.\nA fitting epitaph for a man whose legacy was not just business, but quiet defiance, compassion, and conviction.",

        "article_text": "French fries turned around the fortunes of Jitesh Patel.\nHe comes from a family of farmers in Gujarat in the northwest of India. Traditionally they grew cotton, but the returns were poor. \nDroughts in 2001 and 2002 made the situation worse and the Patels knew things had to change. \n\"We realised that we had to start growing something that does not require lot of water,\" Mr Patel says.\nSo, they experimented with potatoes. Initially they tried table potatoes; the kind available in local markets and cooked at home, but the returns weren't much better than cotton.\nSpurred by the arrival of french fry makers in their state, in 2007 they started growing the varieties of potato used by the food industry. It turned out to be a winning strategy.\n\"Since then, no looking back,\" says Mr Patel.\nMr Patel is part of India's rise to potato superpower status. It is already the world's second biggest spud producer.\nBut it's the export market, particularly of french fries, that's really flying. \nGujarat has become India's capital of french fry production, home to huge factories churning out chips, including facilities belonging to Canadian giant McCain Foods and India's biggest maker of French Fries, HyFun Foods.\nFrom Gujarat fries are sent all over over the world. But the most important markets at the moment are in Asia, including the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, according to Devendra K, who has been studying the potato market for many years. \nIn February of this year, monthly exports of Indian frozen fries broke the 20,000 tonnes barrier for the first time. In the year to February, India's fry exports totalled 181,773 tonnes, a 45% increase compared with the previous year.\nThe success is partly down to price.\n\"Indian frozen fries are noted for being competitively priced in the international market,\" says Devendra. \nHe says that in 2024, the average price of Indian fries was even cheaper than those from China. \nFor the french fry makers, it's boom time.\n\"India has emerged as a significant player and exporter due to its abundant agricultural produce, cost-effective manufacturing, and growing focus on quality standards,\" says Haresh Karamchandani, CEO of HyFun Foods.\nHyFun has seven plants processing potatoes in Gujarat with another two coming online by 2026.\n\"Urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and changing lifestyles have promoted the consumption of frozen foods, not only in the household but also in food service establishments,\" says Mr Karamchandani.\nMeeting that demand has required decades of innovation from farmers.\nJitesh Patel studied agriculture at university and has been applying science to farming ever since. \nAlong with friends and family they are continuously trying to improve their potato yield.\n\"We are a well educated bunch of farmers, so we keep trying new methods,\" he says.\nOne of their first innovations, back in 2003, was to switch to a drip system of irrigation, rather than flooding fields with water.\nTo keep the soil productive the fields are rested over the summer, and fertilised with cow manure.\nTheir focus now is finding the perfect potato plant.\n\"We are in the process of experimenting with seeds and soon we will have a new variety,\" he says. \nJain Irrigation Systems is a large agricultural technology company. As well as selling irrigation equipment, it has teams of technicians developing seeds for agriculture, including potato plants.\nThey use a set of techniques known as tissue culture. It's a way of cloning plants, with desirable traits and eliminating disease. \nIt involves growing small pieces of plant tissue in a controlled laboratory environment to create virus-free plantlets. These plantlets can then be used to produce more seed potatoes through methods like taking cuttings.\n\"Potato seeds destined for future seed production undergo meticulous breeding practices under the supervision of breeders,\" says Vijay Singh, vice president of marketing at the company.\nOne issue they are tackling at the moment concerns a variety of potatoes used to make chips. Farmers found that by November the potato crop starts to go brown because of its sugar content. \n\"Companies like us who are into tissue culture are trying to come up with a new variety to overcome the challenges that the industry is facing,\" says Mr Singh.\nWhile Indian farmers are working on improving their yields, investment is needed elsewhere in the frozen food industry.\nIn particular, firms need to be able to store and transport goods at sub-zero temperatures.\nModern cold storage facilities have been built, but more are needed.\n\"Only about 10\u201315% of India's cold storage facilities are suitable for storing frozen foods,\" says Vijay Kumar Nayak, co-founder of Indo Agri Foods, an exporter of  Indian food. \n\"These facilities are unevenly distributed, heavily concentrated in a few states, leaving rural and remote regions severely underserved.\nTransportation is a problem as well. \n\"There is a notable shortage of specialised refrigerated trucks and containers, making temperature-controlled transportation extremely difficult and increasing the risk of spoilage,\" he says. \nA reliable electricity supply is also essential.\n\"Frequent power outages in many parts of the country increase the chances of spoilage and make running a reliable frozen food supply chain a daunting task,\" says Mr Nayak.\n\"Indian companies face intense competition in export markets from countries like China, Thailand and Brazil. These nations benefit from more advanced logistics, infrastructure, and production systems,\" he points out.\nBack at his Gujarat farm Mr Patel is happy that the chip makers moved in. \n\"Gujarat has become a food processing hub. Most of the farmers, including me, have become contract farmers which gives us security and good money for our yield,\" he says.",

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "When the preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 - which killed 260 people in June - was released, many hoped it would bring some measure of closure.\nInstead, the 15-page report further stoked speculation. For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.\nSeconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why \"did he cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.\nSeveral speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. \nThe Wall Street Journal and Reuters news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". \nItalian newspaper Corriere della Sera claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".\nSumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.\nUnderstandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.\nLast week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".\nJennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were \"premature and speculative\" and that \u201cinvestigations of this magnitude take time\".  \nBack in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. \nSam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.\nAt the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. \nA Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents several possibilities.\nFor example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. \n\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.\n\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".\n\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"\nInvestigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". \nA glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.\nHowever, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.\nSpeculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.\nThe preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. \nThis selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?\nPeter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.\n\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"\nInvestigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.\n\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.\nAt the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. \nIndian newspapers including the Indian Express flagged a possible electrical fire in the tail as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.\nLast week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".\n\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\". He also pledged to share updates on \"technical or public interest matters\" as they arise.\nSumming up, Mr Pruchnicki said the probe \"boils down to two possibilities - either deliberate action or confusion, or an automation-related issue\".\n\"The report doesn't rush to blame human error or intent; there's no proof it was done intentionally,\" he added.\nIn other words, no smoking gun - just an uneasy wait for answers that may never even fully emerge.",

        "article_text": "A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them.\nPrada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing a toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. \nAs the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a \"dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans\". \nOver the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. \nPrada told the BBC that it held a \"successful meeting\" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group.\nThe statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear.\nWhile it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on.\nMany big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source.\nEarlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M ignited a fiery debate on cultural appropriation after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection.\nAnd just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all.\nThe BBC has reached out to Dior for comment.\nSome experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale.\nIn the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices.\nBut critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices.\n\"Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,\" says Shefalee Vasudev, the editor-in-chief of Voice of Fashion. Not doing so, she adds, is \"cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love\".\nEstimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity.\nAnalysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India is expected to nearly double to $14bn by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere.\nBut not everyone shares the optimism.\nArvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion.\nIn recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall.\n\"Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,\" Mr Singhal says. \n\"And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether.\"\nAnand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments.\n\"But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,\" he adds.\nThe frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years.\nThe most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld \"Paris-Bombay\" M\u00e9tiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces.\nMany called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clich\u00e9d imagery and lacked authentic representation of India.\nOthers, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant.\n\"We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,\" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury.\nIn the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a \"genuine oversight\", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. \nFor Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens.\n\"The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,\" she says.\n\"But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine.\"\nThe question of cultural appropriation is complex, and the debates it sparks online can seem both overblown and eye-opening.\nAnd while there are no simple answers, many feel the outrage around Prada has been a great starting point to demand better accountability from brands and designers who, until now, have largely remained unchallenged.\nIt is an opportunity for India, too, to reflect on the ways it can support its own heritage and uplift it. \nWeavers toil for weeks or months to finish one masterpiece, but they often work in precarious conditions without adequate remuneration and with no protection for their work under international intellectual property laws.\n\"We don't take enough pride and credit our own artisans, allowing others to walk all over it,\" Ms Vasudev says.\n\"The trouble also is that in India we have simply too much. There are hundreds of different craft techniques and traditions - each with its constantly evolving motif directory going back centuries,\" says Laila Tyabji, chairperson of Dastkar, which promotes crafts and craftspeople.\n\"We bargain and bicker over a pair of fully embroidered juthis (shoes) but have no issues over buying a pair of Nike trainers at 10 times the price - even though the latter has come off an assembly line while each juthi has been painstakingly and uniquely crafted by hand,\" she says.\nAnd while that continues, she says, foreign designers and merchandisers will do the same.\nReal change can only happen, she says, \"when we ourselves respect and appreciate them - and have the tools to combat their exploitation\".

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nTest matches before final day being played at 'snail's pace' - analysis\nIt has become an unwanted story of England's series against India.\nSlow over-rates. A topic frequently discussed but that never goes away.\nJust 72.3 overs were bowled on day two of the third Test at Lord's.\nThat means, including the necessary time taken for a change of innings, 15 overs were lost from the match not because of rain or bad light but because of the slowness of play.\nThe stoppages are undoubtedly a poor look for the sport but what has changed, what are the rules, does it matter and what can be done?\nIn a five-day Test, 90 overs are scheduled for each day.\nTo prevent teams tactically wasting time to ensure a draw all of the overs must be bowled on the fifth day barring interruptions for the weather but, on the previous days, the overs must be fitted into the six hours of play, with an extra half an hour made available at the end of the day.\nWhile time can be made up for overs lost to the weather, there is no such provision when the reason is simply slow play. If overs are not bowled in that time they are lost from the match.\nThere are some penalties already in place in the International Cricket Council's playing conditions but they have limited impact.\nAn umpire can, after an initial warning, award five penalty runs to an opposition if one team is deemed to be wasting time. This rule has never been enforced in Test cricket.\nA stop clock was also introduced last month where a timer counts down from 60 seconds between overs. Again, five penalty runs can be awarded here but, despite warnings during the first two Tests, neither captain was punished.\nMore common are fines against captains and, in the World Test Championship (WTC) league phase, points deductions.\nAt the end of a WTC match various caveats are taken into accounts, such as injuries and umpire reviews, and a calculation is made as to how far behind the required over-rate a team was. \nThe regulations state: \"A team will have one point deducted from its points total for each penalty over it incurs.\"\nEngland were docked 22 points during the 2023-25 cycle. Captain Ben Stokes has pointed out his team are at a disadvantage because pace bowlers, with their longer run-ups, bowl more overs in the UK than other countries where spin plays a greater part.\nThe over-rate debate is not new. \nThe number of overs bowled per hour has dropped steadily throughout the history of Test cricket, in part down to developments in the game such as umpire reviews, boundary checks, concussion protocol and TV advert breaks.\nPrior to World War Two the average over rate was around 21 per hour. That dropped to 18 between 1945 and 1974, 14.3 from 1975 to 1999 and 14 since 2000.\nThings have taken a further turn in this series. The over-rate across the first two Tests was 13.3 per hour with 39 overs lost in the first Test and 19 in the second.\nA major factor has been the ball. Both teams have repeatedly asked for the ball to be changed because it has gone soft and out of shape. This has led to delays to allow umpires to check the shape and possibly replace the ball.\nThere have been other lengthy breaks too. \nOn day two at Lord's the first drinks break lasted around six minutes and 20 seconds, rather than the standard four.\nGiven the high temperatures in London, there have been regular unscheduled drinks breaks and pauses for batters to change their gloves. \nThere have been a number of breaks for minor injury treatment too.\nBoth England batter Joe Root and India bowler Jasprit Bumrah were asked about the issue after the second day's play.\nRoot suggested teams should only be allowed three attempts to change the ball per innings to save some time.\n\"I don't want to get myself in trouble by trying to rewrite the thing but that's one way of policing the ball thing,\" Root said. \n\"In terms of over rates, it can be quite difficult on a day like today. \n\"We're not used to this, are we? Thirty [degrees] in England feels like 45 elsewhere. But I guess just try and keep on top of it as much as you can.\"\nA point of debate is whether rushing through the overs would diminish the quality of play. Although time was lost, Friday's play was action-packed.\nThere are also fewer draws in Tests now than ever before, meaning a result is still found despite the overs lost.\n\"It's hot out there,\" said Bumrah. \"It's tough on the bowlers. \n\"Sometimes you have to take your time because you don't want your quality to be compromised. You don't want to be too rushed.\"\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: \nWhen it gets to the fifth day you have to bowl the 90 overs. I have no idea why on days one, two, three, or four we see the game played at a snail's pace. \nOn day five when the players and umpires know 90 have to be bowled they are running around, there won't be as many unofficial drinks breaks. \nI would make it simple. You have to bowl 90 overs in a day regardless of the time.\nBBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew: \nI have spent 30 years banging on about over-rates. On the face of it is it boring but it is actually really important because it is just a terrible look. \nYou cannot have up to 15 overs not being bowled. It is totally unacceptable. \nIt is like going to the cinema, watching Pearl and Dean and then the lights go on and you are kicked out. Fines don't work. \nNow teams have time allowed for breaks but they should be penalised on that. There should be a stop clock for drinks breaks. Every time someone comes on to the field to bring gloves or drinks on a clock should start and that counts against that team.\nThen you have to impose penalty runs. It is the only currency players understand.\nTest Match Special statistician Andy Zaltzman:\nThe general play in Test cricket is really good but surely it would be improved by having more of it per day.\nThere is a clock between overs now and the only problem is players completely ignore it. \nYou need an in-game penalty of runs against the batting or bowling side if they are obviously wasting time, maybe with a green or yellow card warning system.\nFormer England captain Sir Alastair Cook: \nThe issue has been going on for years. \nI am not blaming the players. It is time for the ICC and the umpires to step in. The speed of play is their responsibility. Drinks breaks need to be shorter.\nAs players you will always push the boundaries. A 10:30 start would allow another half an hour but would just add to the overall issue. \nAs a captain the last thing you are worried about is the speed of play. You are aware of it because you get fined but the game is far more important for you. It is about winning that moment.\nBBC cricket commentator Simon Mann:\nWe need a proper penalty to concentrate players' minds. You could have a run penalty but it is a little artificial. \nI would calculate how many overs the batting or bowling side is down - it is not just the bowling side that wastes time - and next time they bowl take a fielder off for two, three or five overs. \nFormer England bowler Steven Finn:\nA run penalty would be better than a monetary fine. The problem is there are quite a lot of things that aren't the fault of the bowling team at all - gloves changed too frequently, treatment for minor injuries.\nIt is more complicated than simply punishing the bowling team and I wouldn't want the quality of cricket to be diminished by rushing through too much.\nBBC cricket presenter and commentator Isa Guha:\nSlow over-rates have been a problem for a long time in Test cricket and I feel sorry for the spectators who pay good money and feel like they are missing out on action they have paid for. \nWe can be a bit more flexible with the hours of play and start half an hour earlier the following day to complete overs lost the previous day. We are all here as broadcasters and it would be straightforward to communicate that to the spectators. That would be my solution.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

However, he added that India might still pursue a comprehensive deal if smaller sectoral agreements can be achieved, according to Reuters.The minister expressed similar confidence to Bloomberg, saying he believed India and the US would reach a deal before the deadline. While the tariffs were initially paused until 9 July, the US later extended the deadline to 1 August.Indian delegations have made multiple trips to the US to finalise details of the deal.Last week, Trump seemed equally optimistic, saying that Washington and Delhi were \"very close\" to finalising an interim trade agreement. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.India has already reduced tariffs on a range of goods - including Bourbon whiskey and motorcycles - but the US continues to run a $45bn (\u00a333bn) trade deficit with India, which Trump is keen to reduce.IndiaDonald TrumpUnited States",

        "article_text": "Nine years ago, an Indian student vanished into thin air. \nNajeeb Ahmed was studying biotechnology at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, when he mysteriously went missing in October 2016.\nThe night before his disappearance, the then 27-year-old who lived in one of the university's residential hostels was involved in a scuffle with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student group. The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. \nFor years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. \nNow a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. \n\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. \nMr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. \n\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. \n\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"\nBorn in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four. His family made many sacrifices to support his JNU education.\n\"After completing his undergraduate degree, he was adamant that he wanted to study at JNU,\" Ms Nafees said. \n\"I told him you can take admission, but you won't stay in the hostel. You are too naive. But he didn't listen to me.\"\nOn the night of 14 October, 2016, Mr Ahmed reportedly got into a scuffle with a group of students affiliated to ABVP who were campaigning for hostel elections. JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.\nIn his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. \nThe doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.\nAccording to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.\nA CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. \nMs Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. \nFor days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.\nIn November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.\nA month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. \nIn May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. \nA year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. \nThe agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.\nA one million rupees [$11,600; \u00a38,600] reward for information about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. \nThe case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. \nShe alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.\nThe agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.\n\nExplaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.\nThe judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.\n\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.\nThe court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.\nThe order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. \nColin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. \n\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. \nMs Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.\n\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked.  \n\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. \nHowever, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". \nMs Nafees says she's not done fighting. Every 15 October, the day her son vanished, she joins a candle march at JNU in his memory. The hope has dimmed, but the wait continues.\n\"Sometimes I wonder if I should put a nameplate outside our house,\" said Nafees Ahmed, his father. \n\"Our house has been renovated. What if he comes, but can't recognise it?\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

He played some outrageous strokes and looked set for a century on his home ground until he top-edged a hook to long leg.\nEngland were still 73 behind when Brook became the seventh man out, only for the hosts to be taken to virtual parity by a rapid stand of 55 between Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse.\nWoakes was eventually bowled by the irrepressible Jasprit Bumrah, who did the same to Shoaib Bashir to end with 5-83.\nEngland had the momentum, even more so when Carse had Yashasvi Jaiswal caught behind. Headingley was rocking, which made the stand of 66 between debutant Sudharsan and KL Rahul all the more impressive.\nWith drizzle threatening and the light closing in, Stokes removed Sudharsan for 30. When the umpires decided play could not continue, Rahul had 47, alongside captain Shubman Gill on six. It is beautifully poised.\nWhy Bumrah is most complete fast bowler ever - Finn\nWatch Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer\nIndia lead England by 96 with first Test in balance - as it happened\nThis video can not be played\nRelay catch between Jadeja and Sudharsan dismisses Smith for 40\nThis has been three days of wonderful, see-saw Test cricket, living up to the pre-match billing of two high-quality and evenly matched teams.\nAfter England gifted away the chance to bat first, India have been just as generous in return. The visitors should have got many more than their first-innings 471, then dropped four catches, including three off Bumrah, the man culpable for Brook's no-ball reprieve.\nFor as well as they have battled back, England can also reflect on their own wasted opportunities and moments of recklessness.\nA blustery Sunday showed the best and worst of Bazball. Jamie Smith fell into a bouncer trap two balls after hooking a six, in the over before the second new-ball was due, while Brook was also bounced out.\nIn contrast, the attacking intent of Woakes and Carse scrambled Indian minds and kept England in it.\nEven the final session, with the lights on and clouds threatening, swung this way and that. England will have to chase on a pitch starting to look dry and uneven, so India might be slight favourites.\nThis video can not be played\n'Can you believe it!' Brook out for 99\nReprieved as England reached 209-3 on Saturday, Brook began Sunday by stretching his time on nought to 15 balls. He exploded into life at the end of the first over, slashing Prasidh Krishna for four then belting six over mid-wicket, and never looked back.\nOllie Pope was out to his sixth ball of the day for 106, edging a cut off Krishna, while Stokes was circumspect for 20 before tamely poking Mohammed Siraj behind.\nBrook was full of intent. He danced down to hit Bumrah through the covers and found a similarly purposeful ally in Smith for their stand of 73. Brook was spilled by wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant off spinner Ravindra Jadeja on 46, then fourth slip Jaiswal off Bumrah on 82.\nSmith was strong on the pull, which made his surrender on 40 to Krishna via a relay catch between Jadeja and Sudharsan all the more frustrating.\nDespite losing Smith, Brook climbed into the second new ball in a feisty duel with Siraj. One blow over long-on for six was disdainful. A single away from three figures, he top-edged Krishna into the hands of Shardul Thakur and the disappointment around Headingley was palpable. Brook threw his head back in disbelief, the 16th occasion an England man has been dismissed on 99 in a Test.\nWoakes continued the assault. He pulled and ramped Krishna for successive sixes in his 38. The stand with Carse was riotous entertainment, only ended when Carse made room and was bowled by Siraj for 22. Bumrah did the rest.\nThis video can not be played\n'Superstar' Bumrah bowls Tongue for five-wicket haul as England all out for 465\nAt 430-3 on Saturday morning, India had the game in their grasp. Then Gill holed out off Bashir and his team were second-best for much of what has followed.\nThe drops were their most in a Test innings for five years, the slip cordon missing the retired Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.\nThough spinner Jadeja was tidy, the seamers leaked boundaries and even the great Bumrah did not quite reach the standard he set on Saturday, though that was a very high bar.\nThere was petulance over a number of attempts to get the ball changed - at one point Pant threw it away after being denied by umpire Paul Reiffel. When the second new ball was taken, it was bizarre to be bowling a bouncer plan to Woakes and Carse, England's eight and nine.\nAfter Jaiswal edged Carse off the back foot, India could have imploded. Sudharsan, on a pair, showed great composure and was strong on the cut, while Rahul followed his first-innings 42 with more handsome cover drives.\nSudharsan was badly dropped by Ben Duckett at deep gully off Josh Tongue, only for Stokes, swinging the ball, to induce a loose shot that was pouched by Zak Crawley.\nThis video can not be played\n'Brilliantly played!' - Woakes hits Krishna for back-to-back sixes\nEngland batter Ollie Pope, speaking to BBC Test Match Special: \"I was really happy. It was annoying to not kick on today but it was a good challenge yesterday with the new ball.\n\"That late wicket at the end puts us in an even position. We know we have runs to chase but if we can keep playing as we are, we know we can put together a good score.\"\nIndia fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah on TMS: \"The game is in the balance. We have to bat well. \n\"I like to enjoy my time on the field so I always smile. Nobody is dropping catches purposefully and sometimes the cold makes it difficult to catch. I try not to let if affect me and move forwards quickly.\"\nFormer England captain Sir Alastair Cook on TMS: \"England will certainly be the happier of the two sides. Their belief in their ability to knock off a total is unprecedented.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A state-of-the-art British fighter jet stuck at an airport in India for nearly three weeks now has sparked curiosity and raised questions about how such a modern aircraft could get stranded for days in a foreign country.\nThe F-35B landed at Thiruvananthapuram airport in the southern state of Kerala on 14 June.\nThe aircraft was diverted there after it ran into bad weather during a sortie in the Indian ocean and was unable to return to HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's flagship carrier.\nIt landed safely but it has since developed a technical snag and is unable to return to the carrier.\nSince the jet's landing, engineers from HMS Prince of Wales have assessed the aircraft, but the visiting teams have been unable to fix it so far.\nOn Thursday, the British High Commission said in a statement to the BBC: \"The UK has accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at the airport. It will be moved to the hangar once UK engineering teams arrive with specialist equipment, thereby ensuring there is minimal disruption to scheduled maintenance of other aircraft.\n\"The aircraft will return to active service once repairs and safety checks have been completed,\" it added. \"Ground teams continue to work closely with Indian authorities to ensure safety and security precautions are observed.\" \nAuthorities at Thiruvananthapuram airport told the BBC they were expecting technicians from the UK to arrive on Saturday.\nThe $110m (\u00a380m) jet is being guarded around the clock by six officers from the RAF.\nDr Sameer Patil, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai, told the BBC the Royal Navy had only two options: \"They can repair it and make it fly-worthy or they can fly it out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.\"\nThe case of the stranded jet has also been raised in the House of Commons. \nOn Monday, opposition Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty asked the government to clarify what was being done to secure it and return it to operational service, the UK Defence Journal reported. \n\"What steps are the government taking to recover the plane, how much longer will that take, and how will the government ensure the security of protected technologies on the jet while it is in the hangar and out of view?\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe British armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, confirmed the aircraft remained under close UK control.\n\"We continue to work with our Indian friends who provided first-class support when the F-35B was unable to return to the carrier,\" he said. \"I am certain that the security of the jet is in good hands because Royal Air Force crew are with it at all times.\"\nF-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability. \nSo images of the \"lonely F-35B\", parked on the tarmac and soaked by the Kerala monsoon rains, have spawned memes on social media.\nOne viral post joked that the jet had been put up for sale at an online site at a hugely competitive price of $4m. The listing claimed the jet included features like \"automatic parking, brand-new tyres, a new battery and an automatic gun to destroy traffic violators\".\nOne user on X said the jet deserved Indian citizenship as it had been in the country long enough, while another suggested that India should start charging rent and that the Kohinoor diamond would be the most appropriate payment.\nOn Wednesday, Kerala government's tourism department also joined in the fun with a post on X that said \"Kerala, the destination you'll never want to leave.\"\nThe post included an AI-generated photograph of an F-35B standing on the runway with coconut palm trees in the background. The text suggested that, like most visitors to the state described in tourism brochures as \"God's own country\" for its scenic beauty, the jet too was finding it hard to leave.\nDr Patil says that each passing day that the jet remains stranded, \"it adversely affects the image of the F-35Bs and the Royal Navy\".\n\"The jokes and memes and rumours and conspiracy theories are affecting the image and credibility of the British Royal Navy. The longer the jet stays stranded, the more disinformation will come out.\" \nThe engineering issues \"seem of a much more serious nature\" than it was originally thought, he says.\nBut most militaries, he adds, prepare for \"a worst-case scenario\" - and it is one since a jet is stranded on foreign soil. \n\"Most militaries would have a standard operating procedure [SOP] on how to respond when something like this happens. So does the Royal Navy not have an SOP?\"\nThe optics of this, he says, are really bad. \n\"If such a thing had happened in enemy territory, would they have taken this much time? This makes for very bad PR for a professional navy.\"\nAdditional reporting by Ashraf Padanna in Thiruvananthapuram",

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Warning: This story contains details that some may find disturbing.\nThree weeks after five members of a family in India were brutally killed and allegedly burned alive amid accusations of the practice of witchcraft, the survivors are still trying to come to terms with the tragedy. \nFor Manisha Devi (name changed) of Tetgama village in Bihar state, the night of 6 July has been the darkest in her life.\nAt around 10pm, a belligerent mob gathered outside their relatives' home - by dawn, five people, including a 71-year-old widow Kato Oraon, were dead.\nThe incident in Bihar is not an isolated one. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 2,500 people, mostly women, were killed in India on suspicion of witchcraft between 2000 and 2016. \nBut the Tetgama murders stand out, as five members of a family were killed together.\nCampaigners say superstition and belief in witchcraft remain widespread among many of India's disadvantaged tribal communities, including those involved in the recent Bihar incident.\nThe alleged murderers and victims all belong to the Oraon tribe and have lived together for generations. But what transpired on the night of 6 July has opened a chasm that is unlikely to be bridged anytime soon.\nTetgama's streets now echo with silence - all the residents, except four of Kato Devi's sons and their families, have fled the village. Some homes are locked, while others appear to have been abandoned in a hurry.\nThe BBC spoke to the victims' relatives, police and officials to piece together what happened on the night of the killings.\nManisha Devi says she heard a commotion and found a large crowd outside the home of Babulal Oraon, the eldest of Kato's five sons who lived nearby.\nMr Oraon, his wife Sita Devi, the couple's son Manjit and daughter-in-law Rani Devi were among those killed. His youngest son, a teenager, is the only survivor.\nPolice in their first information report (FIR), which is available online, have named a villager - Ramdev Oraon - as the main accused. \nThey said Ramdev's son had died about 10 days back after falling sick, but he had allegedly accused Kato Devi and her family of killing his child through witchcraft. It's not clear what the belief was based on. \nPolice say Ramdev is absconding and that they are looking for him.\nOn the night of the killings, Ramdev had allegedly brought his nephew, who appeared seriously unwell, to the victims' house. \nManisha Devi said she saw the teenager lying on the ground and the village exorcist performing some rituals and reciting mantras. \nManisha Devi, another relative and the survivor in his police complaint have alleged that the exorcist \"pronounced Kato Devi and Babulal's wife Sita Devi as witches, blaming them for the death and illness in Ramdev's family\". \n\"Kato was dragged out and given half-an-hour to heal the sick teenager. Sita Devi, who was away visiting her mother in a neighbouring village, was called and asked to return if she wanted to see her family alive,\" she added.\nThe second relative who also witnessed the alleged murders says Kato pleaded with the villagers to see reason, but the mob kept getting angrier. \n\"When Babulal and Manjit tried to intervene, the mob attacked them too. Rani Devi was also assaulted when she attempted to shield her husband,\" she adds. \"When Sita Devi returned with her son, the survivor, they too were assaulted.\" \nThe teenager later told the police that he somehow managed to run away, hide in the darkness and watch as his family was lynched and burned.\nThe police complaint names 23 men and women from the village and \"150 to 200 unnamed people who made up the mob\".\n\"The mob was armed with sticks, rods and sharp weapons. They tied all the five victims with a rope and dragged them to the village pond, assaulting and abusing them all the way,\" it says.\nThe complaint adds that the victims were \"half-dead\" when they were doused with petrol and set on fire, their bodies were packed in sacks and taken away on a tractor.\nA senior police official told reporters the next day that the victims were burned alive and their charred bodies had been recovered from a pond near the village.\nDistrict Magistrate Anshul Kumar also initially said the five were burned alive. But he recently told the BBC that the post-mortem report was inconclusive on the issue.\n\"The report indicates evidence of burn injuries and assault; however, it does not clearly articulate the precise cause of death, whether it was due to burning or whether that occurred post-murder.\"\nShockingly, the night-long violence occurred not very far from the Mufassil police station, located just 7km (4.5 miles) away. \nMr Kumar said the police heard about the incident 11 hours after the mob gathered, and acknowledged that it showed \"there were shortcomings somewhere\" and that \"this was our failure\". But the delay, he added, was \"since the entire community was involved\".\nIn the aftermath, the officer-in-charge was suspended. His replacement Sudin Ram told the BBC that four people, including the exorcist, have been arrested. The others are absconding, he said.\n\"We have invoked laws related to unlawful assembly, rioting, causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons, wrongful restrain, mob lynching and disappearance of evidence of offence,\" Mr Ram said, adding that the guilty could face life imprisonment or the death penalty.\nThe BBC has not been able to speak to the exorcist, who is in custody, or to Ramdev, whose whereabouts are unknown. The survivor is in protective custody at a safe location and receiving counselling, police official Mr Kumar said, adding that he is \"gradually recovering.\"\nHis brothers, who were away working when the attack occurred, are receiving free food and support, he added. They're currently staying with relatives in a nearby village.\nA special investigation team is probing the lynchings, but Mr Kumar said superstition-fuelled hysteria drove the crowd to commit the murders.\nOfficials say this is the area's first such incident, with no prior witchcraft cases ever recorded.\nBut Mira Devi, a local social worker, told the BBC that tribal villages lack education and rely more on exorcists than on doctors or medicine.\nVillage council head Santosh Singh says most children skip school to work at nearby brick kilns with their parents. A local teacher, Indranand Chaudhary, confirmed only three are enrolled - and none attend.\nTetgama, a tribal village 11km from Purnea town, is home to 22 families.\nAcross paddy fields, a villager points to burnt maize stalks - the site of the 6 July tragedy.\nNarrow mud paths lead to the victims' homes. At Babulal Oraon's two-room hut, built from corn stalks, bamboo, and mud, time feels frozen.\nIn the room where Manjit and his newlywed wife Rani Devi slept, the bed is neatly made, with a clean sheet and the mosquito net tucked in.\nManisha Devi sits outside her home, haunted by the senseless murders she and others witnessed that night.\n\"We stood helplessly, watching the victims desperately trying to save themselves. That scene still haunts us,\" one man said.",

        "article_text": "Is the \"big, beautiful\" India-US trade deal slipping out of reach?\nWith just days to go before a 9 July deadline set by US President Donald Trump's administration, hopes of clinching an interim trade pact between Delhi and Washington remain alive but increasingly entangled in hard bargaining.\nDespite White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt hinting that the deal was imminent, and Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's upbeat assertion that Delhi would welcome \"a big, good, beautiful\" agreement - in response to Trump's claim that a trade deal with Delhi is coming and would \"open up\" the Indian market - negotiators remain locked in tough discussions. \nKey sticking points persist, particularly over agricultural access, auto components and tariffs on Indian steel.\nIndian trade officials have extended their stay in Washington for another round of talks, even as Delhi signals \"very big red lines\" on farm and dairy protections, and the US presses for wider market openings. The tone remains optimistic - but the window to strike a deal appears to be narrowing.\n\"The next seven days could determine whether India and the US settle for a limited 'mini-deal' or walk away from the negotiating table  - at least for now,\" says Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who runs Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\nThat uncertainty hinges on a few key flashpoints - none more contentious than agriculture.\n\"There are two real challenges to concluding an initial agreement. First on the list is US access to the Indian market for basic agriculture products. India will need to protect its basic agriculture sector for economic and political reasons,\" Richard Rossow, who tracks India's economy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\nMr Rossow says the \"second issue is India's non-tariff barriers. Issues like India's growing set of 'Quality Control Orders' (QCO) are significant obstacles to US market access and may prove tricky to meaningfully handle in a trade deal\".\nThe US has raised concerns over what it calls India's growing and burdensome import-quality rules. Over 700 QCOs - part of the \"self-reliant India\" push - aim to curb low-quality imports and promote domestic manufacturing. Suman Berry, a senior member of a government think tank Niti Aayog, has also called these rules a \"malign intervention\" that restrict imports and raise costs for domestic medium and small scale industries.\nThe elephant in the room is farm exports. India-US farm trade remains modest at $8bn, with India exporting rice, shrimp and spices, and the US sending nuts, apples and lentils. But as trade talks progress, Washington is eyeing bigger farm exports -  maize, soya bean, cotton and corn - to help narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.\nExperts fear tariff concessions could pressure India to weaken its minimum support prices (MSP) and public procurement - key protections that shield farmers from price crashes by guaranteeing fair prices and stable crop purchases.\n\"No tariff cuts are expected for dairy products or key food grains like rice and wheat, where farm livelihoods are at stake. These categories are politically and economically sensitive, affecting over 700 million people in India's rural economy,\" says Mr Srivastava.\nCuriously, a recent Niti Aayog paper recommends tariff cuts on US farm imports -  including rice, dairy, poultry, corn, apples, almonds and GM soya - under a proposed India-US trade pact. It's unclear, however, whether the proposal reflects official government thinking or remains a policy suggestion on paper.\n\"If the US were to say 'no deal' if India does not include access on basic agriculture, then clearly American expectations were not set correctly. Any democratically-elected government will have political limits to commercial policy choices,\" says Mr Rossow.\nSo what could happen with the deal now?\nExperts like Mr Srivastava believe that the \"more likely outcome is a limited trade pact\" - styled after the US-UK mini trade deal announced on 8 May.\nUnder the proposed deal, India may cut tariffs on a range of industrial goods - including automobiles, a long-standing US demand - and offer limited agricultural access via tariff cuts and quotas on select products like ethanol, almonds, walnuts, apples, raisins, avocados, olive oil, spirits and wine.\nBeyond tariff cuts, the US is likely to push India for large-scale commercial buys -  from oil and LNG to Boeing aircraft, helicopters and nuclear reactors. Washington may also seek FDI easing in multi-brand retail, benefiting firms like Amazon and Walmart, and relaxed rules on re-manufactured goods.\n\"This 'mini-deal', if concluded, would therefore focus on tariff reductions and strategic commitments, leaving broader FTA issues - including services trade, intellectual property (IP) rights and digital regulations - for a future negotiation,\"  says Mr Srivastava.\nAt the start, the India-US trade talks appeared to be grounded in a clear and fair vision.\n\"The two leaders [Trump and Modi] laid out a simple concept in their first summit this year. The US would focus on manufactured goods that are capital-intensive, while India would focus on items that are labour-intensive,\" says Mr Rossow. But things appear to have changed since.\nIf talks collapse, experts believe Trump is unlikely to reinstate the steep 26% tariff rate on India. Instead, a 10% baseline tariff may apply to most Indian imports, on top of existing MFN rates (MFN or Most Favoured Nation rate is the lowest tariff rate that a World Trade Organisation member country levies on another WTO member).\nWhile 57 countries faced these levies in April, only the UK has secured a deal so far. Targeting India specifically could seem unfair. \"Still, with Trump, surprises can't be ruled out,\" says Mr Srivastava.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "England pulled off their second-highest successful run chase in a Test to beat India at Headingley\nTest cricket is brilliant.\nYou may have known that long before England's defeat of India in the first Test, or discovered it through what happened at Headingley.\nLast Wednesday morning, the day after England strolled a chase of 371, there was a spike in social media engagement with posts giving love to the five-day game. \"Test cricket is the best format\", \"the Rolls Royce of our great game\", \"there's nothing else like Test cricket\". Naturally, there was a bit of Hundred bashing in there, too.\nThese outbursts of support each time there is a half-decent Test are a strange phenomenon, akin to a subculture being vindicated for a passion in something that would otherwise seem a bit weird. Like admitting to a love of Warhammer, pro wrestling or McFly (no, yes, sometimes - in case you're wondering).\nCompared with other sports, there is not the same fervour after a Premier League thriller, tense final round of a golf major or five-set epic at Wimbledon. Not the same need to proclaim \"that is why (insert sport here) is the best\".\nThere are good reasons for Test cricket devotees to feel under attack, and therefore moved to defend their corner.\nNo other sport has the multiple formats of cricket, something that should be a strength but instead has become its biggest weakness. No other sport has so violently torn itself apart, even if golf has given it a good go.\nArcher kept on to bond with England squad as India ponder changes\nFlintoff not thinking about becoming England coach\nRabbit pie: Why England's Tongue is so good against tailenders\nThis is not meant to be a dig at franchise and short-form leagues. They can be excellent in their own right. In a competitive global market, it is remarkable that what is essentially a new sport has become so lucrative in little more than 20 years.\nWhere all the different elements of cricket should be able to rub along together for the betterment of each other, we have somehow landed in a civil war, almost exclusively fuelled by the game's administrators.\nTake The Hundred as an example. English cricket is right to have a franchise league and the money due to come in should be lauded as a fantastic opportunity for the sport in this country. Instead, The Hundred has never recovered from the awful PR of its launch, a message of 'cricket for people who do not like cricket'. It alienated those already enthralled by the game, who are now stirred to protect their bit of it.\nThe fabric of Test cricket has been chipped away by poor scheduling and the pursuit of dollars, pounds and rupees. If it is eradicated to nothing, leaving a revolving roadshow of leagues, cricket will be infinitely poorer for it.\nAn obvious solution is to separate the calendar into dedicated windows for the different formats, just like football and rugby ringfence various times for international and domestic competitions. Now it is down to cricket's governors to show the required guts and gumption.\nThe irony of Test cricket being under attack is the on-field product has never been so good.\nSince the beginning of 2024, West Indies have won in Brisbane, England in Hyderabad and Sri Lanka at The Oval.\nEveryone has an opinion on the impenetrable format of the World Test Championship, yet it still managed to produce a joyous final at Lord's last month, with South Africa finally climbing the mountain by toppling the mighty Australians.\nEven in the past week, away from Leeds, West Indies flirted with pulling off something special against the Aussies in Barbados, and in Zimbabwe 19-year-old Lhuan-dre Pretorius became the youngest man to make a hundred for South Africa. Keep an eye on him, a megastar of the future.\nMore broadly, runs are being scored faster, wickets taken more regularly, there are more close matches and fewer draws than ever before.\nThe run-rate across all Test cricket in the past three years has been 3.60, the highest of any three-year period. Over the same time, less than 10% of Tests were drawn, down from more than 20% across the previous 20 years and more than 40% historically.\nIt is a disregard for draws that marks England's Bazballers out as innovators.\nIt would be hyperbole to say they have saved Test cricket, still not unreasonable to say they have altered the perspective on the way it could be played - 37 Tests and counting since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum united, only one soggy draw among them.\nDraws can be thrilling - some wonderful Tests have been drawn - but by being so bullish about not considering a stalemate as a possibility, this England team have added a thrilling aspect to the five-day narrative.\nFor those watching, it leaves the wonder of how England will attempt to force a result, regardless of the situation. For opponents, it leaves the fear of always being in danger, the confusion of what it will take to beat Stokes' team. For England, it gives the clarity of thought to attempt and comfortably complete a run chase like the one in Leeds, removing the seed of doubt sewn by the safety net of a draw.\nAs an opening chapter of a 10-part story, comprising this India series and the Ashes against Australia this winter, Headingley was perfect, more than living up to the pre-match billing. There will have been plenty of other series with as much expectation as the two England are undertaking, though it is hard to remember a time when Test cricket has been in such sharp focus for a period of time as prolonged as the next seven months.\nEngland were favourites at Headingley and could, probably should, have lost. India paid the price for dropped catches, a crucial Harry Brook wicket off a no-ball and a tail that refused to wag.\nAs a result, the tourists are in a muddle at Edgbaston. Do they play another one of their Jasprit Bumrah chips, leaving only one for the rest of the series? Will they find a place for magician wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav and simultaneously boost their lower-order batting?\nEngland are settled, with the prospect of Jofra Archer returning for the third Test next week at Lord's, the ground where he made his electrifying debut six years ago. Steve Smith and all that.\nIt would be good for the series if India won this week. Level at 1-1 is all to play for, 2-0 down is as good as over. The visitors will have to battle history - they have never won in eight visits to Edgbaston spanning 58 years.\nAnother classic incoming?\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Parents in several Indian cities, including capital Delhi, are protesting against what they call \"unsustainable\" fee raises by private schools. These increases, they say, are stretching household budgets to a breaking point and taking a toll on their children.\nAaditya Mattey, 14, woke up on 9 May feeling confident about his English exam.\nHis father dropped him off at his school in Indian capital Delhi, but Aaditya never got to write his exam.\n\"Two or three minutes after I entered the class, guards and bouncers asked me to leave the room,\" Aaditya recalls.\nHis father was still standing outside the school gates when Aaditya and a few other students were asked to get on the school bus, which dropped them off at their homes.\nAaditya's name was removed from Delhi Public School Dwarka's rolls after his father refused to pay a recent fee hike which he alleges was arbitrary and unauthorised.\nThe BBC reached out to DPS Dwarka and the Delhi Public School Society - which runs the DPS chain of schools - for comment, but did not receive a response.\nAaditya's case is not an isolated one and DPS is not the only school which is facing allegations of arbitrary fee increase.\nOver the past two months, protests have erupted across Indian cities - from Delhi to Pune to Hyderabad -  as a growing number of parents accuse private schools of imposing steep fee raises. \nIn Delhi, which has emerged as the epicentre of the protests, the issue recently made headlines after DPS Dwarka allegedly confined students in the library, hired security guards to stop them from entering classes and expelled them over unpaid dues. Parents have accused the school of punishing children for financial decisions made by their families.\nGovernment-run schools operate nationwide but often suffer from poor, inconsistent quality, prompting even many low-income families to choose private schools for better opportunities.\nIn Delhi, rules say that private schools on government-leased land must get Directorate of Education (DoE) approval before raising fees and must admit 25% economically weaker or disadvantaged students - a condition tied to their subsidised leases.\nThe BBC has contacted the DoE for comment on the fee rises, which parents have reported to us, but has not received a response.\nSchools, on the other hand, have argued in court and told parents that they are struggling. They cite inflation, rising staff salaries, delayed reimbursements from the government for economically weaker students and the need for infrastructure upgrades as reasons for raising fees.\nDivya Mattey says his son Aaditya's annual fee in 2020 was 93,400 rupees ($1,077; \u00a3802). This, he says, has more than doubled to 189,096 rupees in 2025-26.\nMr Mattey is among dozens of parents who have taken the school to court, alleging it has unlawfully removed students from rolls and harassed families over the fee issue.\n\"We never thought a school of this stature would treat children like this - bar them from classrooms, assign bouncers and make them sit in the library for days,\" he says.\nThe school did not answer the BBC's questions over email and on a phone call. But in court, it reportedly argued that there was no legal obligation to retain students whose fees haven't been paid. According to a report in The Indian Express newspaper, DPS claimed it suffered losses of 490m rupees last year and had to raise fees.\nA notice on the school's website meanwhile accuses \"a small group of parents\" of spreading \"false and malicious information regarding the school fee structure\" in an attempt to \"mislead and create confusion\".\nBut the controversy reflects a broader problem.\nA recent survey by online community platform LocalCircles found that more than 80% of parents with children in private schools said fees had increased by over 10% this academic year. In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, the rise in some schools was as high as 30%.\nIndia has no centralised regulation for private schools; each state sets its own rules.\nFor example, Maharashtra allows a 15% fee rise every two years - subject to review if 25% of parents object - while Karnataka permits a 10% annual increase with audit justification. Enforcement, however, is weak, and legal disputes over fees often drag on for years, providing little timely relief to families.\nGagandeep Singh, whose son attends Mira Model School in West Delhi, says fees rose 45% last year and over 10% this year.\nSingh is willing to pay the earlier DoE-approved fee, but says the school has refused his cheque for the current term, which began nearly three months ago.\nThe BBC reached out to Mira Model School but received no response.\n\"It's not our job to regulate schools,\" Mr Singh says. \"That's what the government is supposed to do.\"\nMeanwhile, many parents fear that the DPS case has set a troubling precedent.\n\"We don't want our children to be thrown out of their classes, like what happened there,\" says Pankaj Gupta, whose son studies at Delhi's Maharaja Agarsain Public School.\nMr Gupta said the school increased fees by 25% this year without advance notice.\n\"We had no choice. We had to pay,\" he added.\nMr Gupta runs a small convenience store but has faced declining sales since the pandemic. The rise of online shopping has further squeezed physical stores. Now, rising school fees are pushing his family to the brink.\nThe BBC has reached out to Maharaja Agarsain Public School for comment.\nAnother parent, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she's considering withdrawing her son from the school he attended since childhood due to an \"unsustainable\" 30% fee hike this year.\n\"Both my husband and I work, but our salaries haven't gone up significantly. As a parent, you try to give your child the best but sometimes that comes at great personal cost,\" she said.\nBut she admits that switching schools also feels risky - what if the next one also increases fees?\n\"It's the same situation everywhere,\" she said.\nThe uproar has prompted the Delhi government to act.\nOn 10 June the state cabinet approved the Delhi School Education (Transparency in Fixation and Regulation of Fees) Ordinance, 2025, pending the Lieutenant Governor's approval - necessary for it to become a law.\nThough not yet public, Education Minister Ashish Sood says it will tighten private school fee regulations.\nBut parents are demanding greater transparency. Last weekend, hundreds protested in Delhi, urging the government to consider their feedback when drafting the bill.\nShikha Sharma Bagga, Supreme Court lawyer and secretary of a group called Justice for All, urges timely audits: \"Schools' finances must be audited before each academic year so parents know what they're paying for.\"\nBack in Dwarka, Aaditya is still trying to get back to class.\nMedia reports say DPS Dwarka has agreed to reinstate students expelled for not paying fees. But Mr Mattey says they are still waiting.\n\"The school has shown some reciprocation, but to this date my child's name is not back on the register,\" he says, adding that he hasn't received any assignments for the current academic session.\n\"My son is only 14. He should be focusing on his studies, not worrying about whether he'll be allowed to sit in class tomorrow.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "In Manhattan's West Village, where culinary trends can change with the seasons, Chef Vijay Kumar is shaping a quiet revolution. \nHis 2025 James Beard Award win for Best Chef: New York State this month is more than just personal recognition - it marks a cultural inflection point. \nChennai-based culinary historian Rakesh Raghunathan says: \"Following in the footsteps of fellow Tamil-origin recipients like Raghavan Iyer and Padma Lakshmi, Vijay Kumar's recognition reflects a growing momentum for south Indian voices on the global culinary stage\". \n\"Tamil cuisine -  along with Sri Lankan Tamil and other south Indian regional traditions - is increasingly being embraced by global diners as something refined, rich, and deeply rooted in culture.\"\nBorn in the small farming village of Natham in southern Tamil Nadu, the 44-year-old Kumar has always cooked from memory - of forests and foraging, firewood stoves and his mother and grandmother serving meals made from scratch for the family.\nWhen he took the stage at the JB awards ceremony, he said \"the food I grew up on, the food made with care, with fire, with soul is now taking the main stage\". It was a moment of deep emotion and cultural pride for Kumar. \n\"There is no such thing as a poor person's food, or a rich person's food. It's food. It's powerful. And the real luxury is to be able to connect with each other around the dinner table.\"\nFor Kumar, the win is a personal milestone but also a powerful act of visibility. \n\"When I started cooking, I never thought a dark-skinned boy from Tamil Nadu could make it to a room like this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. It was therefore important for him to wear veshti, the traditional Tamil attire for men, for the black-tie James Beard ceremony as a nod to his roots.\nRecently, Kumar was trolled by a pair of influencers in New York. Quick to rise to his defence was Padma Lakshmi, cookbook author and culinary ambassador, who called the influencers out for their cultural insensitivity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Lakshmi said \"Vijay's story is important not just for south Indian food but also as a story of someone who grew up with humble means and cooked with limited resources.\" \n\"This resourcefulness has not only propelled his work ethic but enhanced his sense of flavour, ingredients and sense of the world. He is a beacon of hope to young people all over the world that if you trust and develop your senses and skills, you can go far in a creative career.\"\nKumar's journey wasn't smooth to start with. \nUnable to afford engineering school in the big city, he chose culinary school instead - beginning his journey at Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai, cooking his way through cruise ships and kitchens, and eventually finding his promised land in America, working at Dosa in San Francisco. \nHis real breakthrough came when he partnered with Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya of Unapologetic Foods, a New York restaurant group, to open Semma - a Tamil slang word for \"fantastic\" in 2021.\nThe trio found a \"shared sense of wanting to honour our heritage, to tell the world who we really are through our cuisine\". \n\"At that moment, it wasn't just about food, it was about identity,\" Mazumdar told the BBC. \"For too long, Indian food in the US has lived under the veil of a manufactured, watered-down north-western lens. With Semma, we set out to pull back that curtain and share something more honest.\"\nKumar jumped at the opportunity to share his cuisine with the world. \"His eyes lit up when we started talking about the food we grew up eating, and that kind of food rarely makes it to restaurant menus,\" recalls Mazumdar.\nKumar's strength lies in serving authentic village food that is seasonal, hyper-local, and built entirely from scratch. His farm-to-table approach, he says, was to cook the way \"my mother and grandmother did\". Semma, he adds, is a celebration of that simplicity.\nThat simplicity resonates. \nSemma's menu defies the clich\u00e9s that often define Indian food abroad. There's no butter chicken or naan here and Kumar's epiphany came with an unlikely encounter: French escargot. \nAs a child, on days when rice was scarce, he would forage with his family for snails in the paddy fields, which would be cooked in a savoury tamarind sauce. Kumar admitted that he was ashamed of it as a boy as it \"felt like food born of poverty - until I saw the pride with which the French serve escargot\". \nToday, the dish, nathai pirattal, sits proudly on Semma's menu, reimagined not as a memory of scarcity, but as a symbol of resilience and cultural pride. \nSemma's menu - pepper rasam, tamarind crab, banana flower vadai, the ubiquitous dosa - offer an emotional connection for many diaspora diners, and a revelation for first-timers.\nKumar's intention to bring village-style Tamil food and showcase it in upscale spots and in the cut-throat New York restaurant space has won a long line of admirers. \nThere's depth, regionality and a powerful emotional connection in this food. \nThe cocktails are a nod to Tamil film stars like Rajnikanth and Silk Smitha, and the d\u00e9cor channels Chennai's warmth. Even the kitchen is a space of intention - cooks are asked to prepare food with \"gratitude and mindfulness\".\n\"I invited him to curate a black-tie gala dinner for 650 guests at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles, and he made us all proud. A year later, people still talk about how incredible the food was,\" says Lakshmi, applauding Kumar's gift for bringing regional Indian cuisine to the most glamorous platforms.\nThe awards and accolades feel like a natural progression of his journey. Semma is the first New York restaurant serving only south Indian cuisine to win a Michelin star and topped The New York Times's list for top 100 restaurants. And now the JBA for Kumar.\nIn many ways, Kumar is not just serving food - he is serving memory, pride and a quiet revolution. \nHis James Beard win is a recognition of his talent, but also an affirmation that regional Indian cuisine, with its bold spices and soulful simplicity, belongs at the centre of the global table.\nKumar's win has piqued the \"curiosity of young people from all over the Indian diaspora and instilled a greater pride in our food ways\", says Lakshmi. \"This will be his greatest legacy.\"\nAdds Mazumdar, \"This win is a signal that regionality matters, and that our stories and our roots have value on the world stage.\"",

The left engine was last serviced in 2023 and due for its next maintenance check in December 2025,\" he told Times Now channel. \nAt least 270 people, most of them passengers, were killed last Thursday when AI171, a London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in western India.\nInvestigators are now sifting through debris and decoding recorded flight data and cockpit audio - from the aircraft's black boxes which have been found - to reconstruct the flight's final moments and determine the cause of the incident.\n\"There are a lot of speculations and a lot of theories. But the fact that I know so far is this particular aircraft, this specific tail, AI171, has a clean history,\" Mr Chandrasekaran said, cautioning people against jumping to conclusions.\n\"I am told by all the experts that the black box and recorders will definitely tell the story. So, we just have to wait for that,\" he added.\nKishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, told the BBC that the condition of an aircraft engine is not necessarily linked to its age - particularly in the case of the Genx-1B engines used on the Boeing 787-8.\n\"The age of the engine has no bearing on the health of the engine, especially for the Genx-1B engines,\" Mr Chinta said. In other words just because an engine is new, does not necessarily mean it is healthy, or vice versa. \nUnlike older models, the Genx-1B engines, which are made by GE Aerospace, don't follow a fixed overhaul or maintenance schedule. Instead, they are equipped with a system called the Full Authority Digital Engine Control or FADEC that continuously monitors engine health and performance. The decision to service or replace the engine is based on this data and physical inspections.\nHowever, Mr Chinta pointed out that certain components of the engine, known as Life Limited Parts (LLPs), still have a fixed lifespan typically between 15,000 and 20,000 cycles.\n\"Every start and switch-off of the engine counts as one cycle,\" he explained.\nWhile the investigation continues, Air India has also announced a 15% cut in its international operations on wide-body aircraft until mid-July as it grapples with the fallout from the crash.\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the decision was driven by \"compounding circumstances\" - including enhanced safety checks, increased caution by crew and ground staff and tensions in the Middle East.\nSeparately, the airline said that inspections have been completed on 26 of its 33 Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft, all of which have been \"cleared for service\". \nIndia's aviation regulator had ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet after the deadly crash as a \"preventive measure\".\nThe remaining aircraft are expected to be examined in the coming days, Air India said, adding that the airline's Boeing 777 fleet would also \"undertake enhanced safety checks\".\n\"The curtailments are a painful measure to take, but are necessary following a devastating event which we are still working through and an unusual combination of external events,\" it said. \nMeanwhile some experts say the crash will likely have an impact on Air India as it tries to transform from a troubled state-owned carrier to a privately-owned company. \nTata Sons, a conglomerate which also owns big brands like Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover, bought the airline - formerly India's national carrier - from the Indian government in 2022. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.\nJust seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to \"cut-off\" is a move typically done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power.\nAir India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters. \nInvestigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after take-off. The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data about 50 seconds in, according to the FlightRadar24 website.\nThe preliminary report from the investigation - led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - raises several questions.\nInvestigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they're highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps. \n\"It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,\" a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.\nThat's what makes the Air India case stand out.\nIf one of the pilots was responsible for shutting down the switches, intentionally or not, it \"does beg the question: why\", said Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University.\n\"Was it intentional, or the result of confusion? That seems unlikely, as the pilots reported nothing unusual. \n\"In many cockpit emergencies, pilots may press the wrong buttons or make incorrect selections - but there was no indication of such a situation here, nor any discussion suggesting that the fuel switches were selected by mistake,\" he said.\n\"This kind of error doesn't typically happen without some evident issue.\"\nPeter Goelz, a former managing director of the US's NTSB, said: \"The finding is very disturbing - that a pilot has shut off the fuel switch within seconds of flying.\"\n\"There's likely much more on the cockpit voice recorder than what's been shared. A lone remark like 'why did you cut off the switches' isn't enough,\" he said.\n\"The new details suggest someone in the cockpit shut those valves. The question is, who, and why? Both switches were turned off and then restarted within seconds. \n\"The voice recorder will reveal more: was the flying pilot trying to restart the engines, or the monitoring one?\"\nInvestigators believe the cockpit voice recorder - with audio from pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds - holds the key to this puzzle.\n\"They haven't identified the voices yet, which is crucial. Typically, when the voice recorder is reviewed, people familiar with the pilots are present to help match voices. As of now, we still don't know which pilot turned the switches off and back on,\" said Mr Goelz.\nIn short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed.\nThey also say this underscores the need for cockpit video recorders, as recommended by the NTSB. An over-the-shoulder view would show whose hand was on the cut-off switch. \nBefore boarding Flight 171, both pilots and crew had passed breathalyser tests and had been cleared fit to fly, the report says. The pilots, based in Mumbai, had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had adequate rest.\nBut investigators are also zeroing in on what they describe is an interesting point in the report.\nIt says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nWhile the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.\nThe same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8 aircraft, including Air India's VT-ANB which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory, Air India did not perform the recommended inspections. \nMr Pruchnicki said he's wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.\n\"What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut the fuel supply? When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens? Could the switch just flip itself to off and shut down the engine? If that's the case, it's a really serious issue. If not, that also needs to be explained,\" he said.\nOthers, however, aren't convinced this is a key issue.\n\"I haven't heard of this which appears to be a low-profile FAA issuance. Nor have I heard any complaints [about the fuel switches] from pilots - who are usually quick to speak up. It's worth examining since it's mentioned, but it may just be a distraction,\" said Mr Goelz.\nCapt Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), wonders whether the switches tripped because of a problem with the plane's electronic control unit.\n\"Can the fuel cut-off switches be triggered electronically by the plane's electronic control unit without movement by the pilot? If the fuel cut-off switches tripped electronically, then it's a cause for concern,\" he told the BBC.\nThe report says fuel samples from the refuelling tanks were \"satisfactory\". Experts had earlier suggested fuel contamination as a possible cause of the dual engine failure. Notably, no advisory has been issued for the Boeing 787 or its GE GEnx-1B engines, with mechanical failure ruled out for now pending further investigation.\nIt also said that the aircraft's Ram Air Turbine (RAT) had deployed - a clear sign of a major systems failure - and the landing gear was found in \"down position\" or not retracted.\nThe RAT, a small propeller that extends from the underside of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, acts as an emergency backup generator. It automatically deploys in flight when both engines lose power or if all three hydraulic systems register critically low pressure, supplying limited power to keep essential flight systems operational.\n\"The deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) strongly supports the conclusion that both engines had failed,\" Mr Pruchnicki said.\nA Boeing 787 pilot explained why he thought the landing gear was not retracted.\n\"These days, every time I take off in a 787, I notice the landing gear retraction process closely. By the time the gear handle is pulled, we're already at about 200ft (60.9m), and the entire gear retraction process completes by around 400ft - roughly eight seconds in total, thanks to the aircraft's high-pressure hydraulic system.\" \nThe pilot believes the one flying had no time to think.\n\"When both engines fail and the aircraft starts going down, the reaction goes beyond just being startled - you go numb. In that moment, landing gear isn't your focus. Your mind is on one thing: the flight path. Where can I put this aircraft down safely? And in this case, there simply wasn't enough altitude to work with.\"\nInvestigators say the crew tried to recover, but it happened too fast.\n\"The engines were switched off and then back on. The pilots realised the engines were losing thrust - likely restarting the left one first, followed by the right,\" said Mr  Pruchnicki.\n\"But the right engine didn't have enough time to spool back up, and the thrust was insufficient. Both were eventually set to \"run\", but with the left shut down first and the right too late to recover, it was simply too little, too late.\"\nFamilies and friends of the crash victims had been anxiously awaiting the findings of the preliminary report.\nWhen the report was finally released early on Saturday in India, Imtiyaz Ali, who lost his brother, sister-in-law, and their two young children - read it carefully, only to be disappointed by what he said \"reads like a product description\".\n\"Other than the pilots' final conversation, there's nothing in it that really points to what caused the crash.\"\nHe said he hoped more details would be made public in the months to come.\n\"This matters to us. We want to know exactly what happened. It won't change anything for us now, we continue grieving - just as we have since that day. \n\"But at least we'll have some answers,\" Ali said.",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

The crew, including Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary, will spend two weeks on the ISS.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to travel to space. His trip comes 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to fly aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - lifted off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 02:31 EDT (06:31 GMT; 12:01 India time) on Wednesday. \nThe docking on Thursday occurred at 06:31EDT (10:31 GMT; 16:01 India time).

After fleeting appearances in white-ball cricket in 2022, he went more than three years without another call-up.\nAt the beginning of this summer, he said he was \"realistic\" about his England prospects, only to receive a recall for the T20 series against West Indies in May.\nHe now gets his chance in the Test side, leap-frogging fellow left-armer Jack Leach, who was part of England's squads during the winter and has a central contract.\n\"He brings experience and guile,\" batter Harry Brook told BBC Sport. \"He's very skilful.\n\"He's been around the block, played hundreds of games and he's a great bloke. He's very competitive and he's a very good player.\n\"He was very nervous before his T20 comeback and I'm sure he'll be nervous this week. I'm sure he'll let his experience and skills take over.\"\nEngland XI for fourth Test v India: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith (wicketkeeper), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.\nThis video can not be played\nBrook on the 'needle' between England and India in their fourth Test match\nWoakes has struggled to make an impact in the first three Tests, though did have his most successful match at Lord's, taking four wickets.\nHe gets the nod over Atkinson partly because of his record on this ground. The 36-year-old averages almost 37 with the bat and 17 with the ball in Manchester.\nAtkinson was put through a fitness test at Old Trafford on Monday. He has not played professionally since injuring his hamstring in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May.\nHe was deemed fit enough if required, but given the other options in the squad and the fact Atkinson has played only one day of club cricket in two months, there was no need for England to take a risk.\nAtkinson will now return to Surrey. The county champions have a  fixture away at Yorkshire, beginning on Tuesday, but had already told their players of a starting XI before they became aware of Atkinson's potential availability.\nLike England, Surrey were wary of selecting Atkinson after his lengthy spell out. Jamie Overton was already due to play his first first-class match in two months, so adding Atkinson would have meant two seamers feeling their way back to fitness. \nAtkinson will instead build up his match-sharpness for the second XI against Somerset on the same day.\nAny slim chance that fellow pace bowler Mark Wood could return for the fifth Test following knee surgery is now over. Wood is instead targeting the white-ball matches against South Africa at the end of the summer.\nIndia will make at least one change to the side beaten at Lord's, after all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy was ruled out of the rest of the series with a knee injury.\nWicketkeeper Rishabh Pant batted in the nets on Monday and looks to have recovered from the finger injury that hampered him in the third Test.\nThere is yet no decision on Jasprit Bumrah.

        "article_text": "At midnight on 25 June 1975, India - a young democracy and the world's largest - froze.\nThen prime minister Indira Gandhi had just declared a nationwide Emergency. Civil liberties were suspended, opposition leaders jailed, the press gagged, and the constitution turned into a tool of absolute executive power. For the next 21 months, India was technically still a democracy but functioned like anything but.\nThe trigger? A bombshell verdict by the Allahabad High Court had found Gandhi guilty of electoral malpractice and invalidated her 1971 election win. Facing political disqualification and a rising wave of street protests led by veteran socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan, Gandhi chose to declare an \"internal emergency\" under Article 352 of the constitution, citing threats to national stability.\nAs historian Srinath Raghavan notes in his new book on Indira Gandhi, the constitution did allow wide-ranging powers during an Emergency. But what followed was \"extraordinary and unprecedented strengthening of executive power... untrammelled by judicial scrutiny\".\nOver 110,000 people were arrested, including major opposition political figures such as Morarji Desai, Jyoti Basu and LK Advani. Bans were slapped on groups from the right-wing to the far-left. Prisons were overcrowded and torture was routine.\nThe courts, stripped of independence, offered little resistance. In Uttar Pradesh, which jailed the highest number of detainees, not a single detention order was overturned. \"No citizen could move the courts for enforcement of their fundamental rights,\" writes Raghavan.\nDuring a controversial family planning campaign, an estimated 11 million Indians were sterilised - many by coercion. Though officially state-run, the programme was widely believed to be orchestrated by Sanjay Gandhi, the unelected son of Indira Gandhi. Many believe a shadowy second government, led by Sanjay, wielded unchecked power behind the scenes.\nThe poor were hit hardest. Cash incentives for surgery often equalled a month's income or more. In one Delhi neighbourhood near the Uttar Pradesh border -  derisively dubbed \"Castration Colony\" (places where forced sterilisation programmes took place) - women reportedly said they'd been made bewas (widows) by the state as \"our men are no longer men\". Police in Uttar Pradesh alone recorded over 240 violent incidents tied to the programme.\nIn their book on Delhi under Emergency, civil-rights activist John Dayal and journalist Ajoy Bose wrote that officials were under intense pressure to meet sterilisation quotas. Junior officers enforced the order ruthlessly - contract labourers were told, \"No advances, no jobs, unless you get vasectomies.\" \nParallel to this, a massive urban \"clean-up\" demolished nearly 120,000 slums, displacing some 700,000 people in Delhi alone, as part of a gentrification campaign described by critics as social cleansing. These people were dumped into new \"resettlement colonies\" far away from their workplaces. \nOne of the worst episodes of slum demolitions occurred in Delhi's Turkman Gate, a Muslim-majority neighbourhood, where police fired on protesters resisting demolition, killing at least six and displacing thousands.\nThe press was silenced overnight. On the eve of the Emergency, power to newspaper presses in Delhi was cut. By morning, censorship was law. \nWhen The Indian Express newspaper finally published its 28 June edition - delayed by a power outage - it left a blank space where its editorial should have been. The Statesman followed suit, printing blank columns to signal censorship. Even The National Herald, founded by India's first prime minister and Indira Gandhi's father Jawaharlal Nehru, quietly dropped its masthead slogan: \"Freedom is in peril, defend it with all your might.\" Shankar's Weekly, a satirical magazine known for its cartoons, shut down entirely.\nIn her book - a personal history of the Emergency - journalist Coomi Kapoor reveals the extent of media censorship through detailed examples of blackout orders. \nThese included bans on reporting or photographing slum demolitions in Delhi, conditions in a maximum-security Tihar Jail, and developments in opposition-ruled states like Tamil Nadu. Coverage of the family planning drive was tightly controlled - no \"adverse comments or editorials\" were permitted. Even stories deemed trivial or embarrassing were scrubbed: no \"sensational\" reporting on a notorious bandit and no mention of a Bollywood actress caught shoplifting in London.\nKapoor also notes that BBC's Mark Tully, along with journalists from The Times, Newsweek and The Daily Telegraph, were given 24 hours to leave India for refusing to sign a \"censorship agreement\". (Years after the Emergency, when Gandhi was back in power, Tully introduced her to the BBC's chief. He asked how it felt to lose public support. She smiled and said, \"I never lost the support of the people, only the people were misled by rumours, many of which were spread by the BBC.\")\nSome judges pushed back. The Bombay and Gujarat high courts warned that censorship couldn't be used to \"brainwash the public\". But that resistance was quickly drowned out. \nThat wasn't all. In July 1976, Sanjay Gandhi pushed the Youth Congress - the governing Congress party's youth wing - to adopt his personal five-point programme, including family planning, tree plantation, refusal of dowry, promotion of adult literacy and abolition of caste. \nCongress president DK Barooah instructed all state and local committees to implement Sanjay's five points alongside the government's official 20-point programme, effectively merging state policy with Sanjay's personal crusade.\nAnthropologist Emma Tarlo, author of a richly detailed ethnographic work of the period, wrote that during the Emergency, the poor were subjected to \"forced choices\". It was also a turning point for industrial relations. \n\"The last vestiges of working-class politics were imperiously wiped out,\" wrote Christophe Jaffrelot and Pratinav Anil in their book on the period they call \"India's first dictatorship\".  Around 2,000 trade union leaders and members were jailed, strikes were banned and worker benefits were slashed. \nThe number of man-days lost to stoppages plunged - from 33.6 million in 1974 to just 2.8 million in 1976. Strikers dropped from 2.7 million to half a million. The government also loosened its grip on the private sector, helping the economy rebound after years of stagnation. Industrialist JRD Tata praised the regime's \"refreshingly pragmatic and result-oriented approach\".\nDespite its heavy-handedness, the Emergency was seen by some as a period of order and efficiency. Inder Malhotra, a journalist, wrote that in \"its initial months at least, the Emergency restored to India a kind of calm it had not known for years\".\nTrains ran on time, strikes vanished, production rose, crime fell, and prices dropped after a good 1975 monsoon - bringing much-needed stability. \"One fact is conclusive proof of the quiescence of the middle class - that hardly any officials resigned in protest against the Emergency,\" writes historian Ramachandra Guha in his book India After Gandhi. \nScholars believe the Emergency's harshest measures were largely confined to northern India because southern states had stronger regional parties and more resilient civil societies that limited central overreach. Gandhi's Congress party, which ruled federally, had weaker control in the south, giving regional leaders greater autonomy to resist or moderate draconian policies. \nThe Emergency formally ended in March 1977 after Gandhi called elections - and lost. The new Janata government - a rag-tag coalition of parties - rolled back many of the laws she'd passed. But the deeper damage was done. As many historians have written, the Emergency revealed how easily democratic structures could be hollowed out from within - even legally.\n\"It is no wonder that the Emergency is remembered emotively in India... Indira's suspension of constitutional rights appears as an abrupt disavowal of the liberal-democratic spirit that animated Nehru and other nationalist leaders who founded India as a constitutional republic in 1950,\" historian Gyan Prakash wrote in his book on the Emergency.\nToday, the Emergency is remembered in India as a brief authoritarian interlude - an aberration. But that framing, warns Prakash, breeds \"a smug confidence in the present\". \n\"It tells us that the past is really past, it is over, it is history. The present is free from its burdens. India's democracy, we are told, heroically recovered from Indira's brief misadventure with no lasting damage and with no enduring, unaddressed problems in its functioning,\" Prakash writes.\n\"Underlying it is an impoverished conception of democracy, one that regards it only in terms of certain forms and procedures.\"\nIn other words, this perception ignores how fragile democracy can be when institutions fail to hold power to account. \nThe Emergency was also a stark warning against the perils of hero worship - something embodied in the towering political persona of Indira Gandhi. \nBack in 1949, BR Ambedkar, architect of the constitution, cautioned Indians against surrendering their freedoms to a \"great leader\".\nBhakti (devotion), he said, was acceptable in religion - but in politics, it was \"a sure road to degradation and eventual dictatorship\".",

        "article_text": "Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.\nJust seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to \"cut-off\" is a move typically done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power.\nAir India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters. \nInvestigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after take-off. The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data about 50 seconds in, according to the FlightRadar24 website.\nThe preliminary report from the investigation - led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - raises several questions.\nInvestigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they're highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps. \n\"It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,\" a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.\nThat's what makes the Air India case stand out.\nIf one of the pilots was responsible for shutting down the switches, intentionally or not, it \"does beg the question: why\", said Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University.\n\"Was it intentional, or the result of confusion? That seems unlikely, as the pilots reported nothing unusual. \n\"In many cockpit emergencies, pilots may press the wrong buttons or make incorrect selections - but there was no indication of such a situation here, nor any discussion suggesting that the fuel switches were selected by mistake,\" he said.\n\"This kind of error doesn't typically happen without some evident issue.\"\nPeter Goelz, a former managing director of the US's NTSB, said: \"The finding is very disturbing - that a pilot has shut off the fuel switch within seconds of flying.\"\n\"There's likely much more on the cockpit voice recorder than what's been shared. A lone remark like 'why did you cut off the switches' isn't enough,\" he said.\n\"The new details suggest someone in the cockpit shut those valves. The question is, who, and why? Both switches were turned off and then restarted within seconds. \n\"The voice recorder will reveal more: was the flying pilot trying to restart the engines, or the monitoring one?\"\nInvestigators believe the cockpit voice recorder - with audio from pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds - holds the key to this puzzle.\n\"They haven't identified the voices yet, which is crucial. Typically, when the voice recorder is reviewed, people familiar with the pilots are present to help match voices. As of now, we still don't know which pilot turned the switches off and back on,\" said Mr Goelz.\nIn short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed.\nThey also say this underscores the need for cockpit video recorders, as recommended by the NTSB. An over-the-shoulder view would show whose hand was on the cut-off switch. \nBefore boarding Flight 171, both pilots and crew had passed breathalyser tests and had been cleared fit to fly, the report says. The pilots, based in Mumbai, had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had adequate rest.\nBut investigators are also zeroing in on what they describe is an interesting point in the report.\nIt says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nWhile the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.\nThe same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8 aircraft, including Air India's VT-ANB which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory, Air India did not perform the recommended inspections. \nMr Pruchnicki said he's wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.\n\"What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut the fuel supply? When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens? Could the switch just flip itself to off and shut down the engine? If that's the case, it's a really serious issue. If not, that also needs to be explained,\" he said.\nOthers, however, aren't convinced this is a key issue.\n\"I haven't heard of this which appears to be a low-profile FAA issuance. Nor have I heard any complaints [about the fuel switches] from pilots - who are usually quick to speak up. It's worth examining since it's mentioned, but it may just be a distraction,\" said Mr Goelz.\nCapt Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), wonders whether the switches tripped because of a problem with the plane's electronic control unit.\n\"Can the fuel cut-off switches be triggered electronically by the plane's electronic control unit without movement by the pilot? If the fuel cut-off switches tripped electronically, then it's a cause for concern,\" he told the BBC.\nThe report says fuel samples from the refuelling tanks were \"satisfactory\". Experts had earlier suggested fuel contamination as a possible cause of the dual engine failure. Notably, no advisory has been issued for the Boeing 787 or its GE GEnx-1B engines, with mechanical failure ruled out for now pending further investigation.\nIt also said that the aircraft's Ram Air Turbine (RAT) had deployed - a clear sign of a major systems failure - and the landing gear was found in \"down position\" or not retracted.\nThe RAT, a small propeller that extends from the underside of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, acts as an emergency backup generator. It automatically deploys in flight when both engines lose power or if all three hydraulic systems register critically low pressure, supplying limited power to keep essential flight systems operational.\n\"The deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) strongly supports the conclusion that both engines had failed,\" Mr Pruchnicki said.\nA Boeing 787 pilot explained why he thought the landing gear was not retracted.\n\"These days, every time I take off in a 787, I notice the landing gear retraction process closely. By the time the gear handle is pulled, we're already at about 200ft (60.9m), and the entire gear retraction process completes by around 400ft - roughly eight seconds in total, thanks to the aircraft's high-pressure hydraulic system.\" \nThe pilot believes the one flying had no time to think.\n\"When both engines fail and the aircraft starts going down, the reaction goes beyond just being startled - you go numb. In that moment, landing gear isn't your focus. Your mind is on one thing: the flight path. Where can I put this aircraft down safely?

        "article_text": "Sloth bears are the world's deadliest bear. As their habitat shrinks, India's forest communities are finding ways to co-exist with them.\nFor the tiger, it must have felt like easy prey: a female sloth bear and her cub, walking away from a watering hole near a safari lodge in India. The tiger stalks the bear through dry scrub, preparing to attack. That's when things take a surprising turn.\nInstead of freezing or trying to escape, the sloth bear whips around, and charges at the startled-looking tiger. The tiger rears and fights back, and a 45-minute-long battle ensues, with the two biting and clawing at each other. Watch the video below to see their ferocious fight.\u00a0\nSloth bears (named due to their long claws and teeth, supposedly resembling a sloth) which live in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, are widely considered among the most aggressive animals on the Indian subcontinent. They are known to charge explosively at anyone they consider a threat \u2013 not just tigers, but also, humans. One study counting large carnivore attacks on humans around the world between 1950 and 2019 found that sloth bear attacks outnumbered all other species, including tigers, lions, wolves and any other bears. There had been 1,337 sloth bear attacks on humans during that period, compared to 1,047 by tigers, 414 by wolves, and only 23 by polar bears, for example. (Though tiger, lion and other big cat attacks on humans are deadlier \u2013 around 65% of them are fatal to humans, whereas around 8% of sloth bear attacks are lethal).\nHowever, sloth bears are also facing many threats themselves, from habitat degradation to retaliation by humans. Their population is declining, and they have been classed as a vulnerable species, with their global population estimated at fewer than 20,000.\u00a0\nThat's not only a problem for the bears themselves \u2013 sloth bears have important benefits as ecosystem engineers who disperse fruit seeds and control termite populations. But research suggests that insights into the sloth bears' behaviour, including how they react to perceived threats, could help keep both humans and sloth bears safer.\nThe ferocity of sloth bears may be surprising given that the bears feed on fruit, termites and ants, and don't prey on mammals. But sloth bears may in fact have evolved their explosive strategy to survive among carnivores such as tigers, according to a 2024 study. \"Explosively charging and attacking a potential threat has served sloth bears well for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years,\" according to the study's authors. Their analysis of 43 encounters between sloth bears and tigers suggests that the scare tactics work: the clashes mostly ended with both sides backing off and the tiger running away largely unharmed.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the fight near the safari lodge, the female sloth bear and the male tiger also turned out to be quite evenly matched opponents, according to the naturalist who observed them.\n\"Tigers are very powerful, but their stamina might not last. And sloth bears are extremely hairy, so the tiger did not get proper grip on the throat of the sloth bear,\" says Akshay Kumar, the chief naturalist and manager of Bamboo Forest Safari Lodge in Tadoba National Park in Maharashtra state in India, who filmed the encounter.\nBy the end, the male tiger was completely tired out, Kumar says: \"He came and sat in the water body, for a couple of hours, just exhausted.\" The sloth bear wandered away. Kumar spotted both the sloth bear and the tiger separately over the following days. \"They looked fine,\" he says.\nFor humans, however, the outcome of such a clash can be far worse. Firstly, unlike tigers, humans are not fast enough to outrun sloth bears. Also, the attacks themselves can be especially damaging to humans as the bears mostly attack the head, and their sharp, long claws can rip off people's faces and gouge out their eyes.\u00a0\n\"There are a lot of issues around human and sloth bear conflicts, and most of those conflicts are about sloth bears attacking humans,\" says Nishith\u00a0Dharaiya, director of the Centre for Wildlife Research at BKNM University in Junagadh, India, and an expert in human-sloth bear conflict. People may retaliate by killing sloth bears, Dharaiya says.\nEncounters between sloth bears and humans are increasing, intensified by habitat loss and degradation. But according to Dharaiya, those clashes are avoidable, based on insights into how, why and when sloth bears attack.\nOne of Dharaiya's key arguments is that sloth bears are actually not necessarily inherently aggressive, or intending to kill. Rather, he describes their deadliness to humans as a somewhat unintended consequence of a defence strategy that's mainly meant to scare the enemy off, for example, when a female bear carrying cubs feels threatened.\u00a0\n\"Whether it's a tiger, lion, leopard, human, the sloth bear initially tries to show itself as bigger than the other animal,\" he explains. \"It stands on its hind legs, and then attacks with its forelegs,\" equipped with long claws, which help them dig for ants as part of their usual feeding habit.\nIn fights with tigers, standing may give the bears an important advantage. In the study analysing videos of bear-tiger battles, almost all sloth bears stood up when the tiger was at close range, and the one sloth bear that did not stand was immediately killed. By contrast, none of the tigers were seriously injured or killed in any of the encounters, probably helped by the fact that they are faster than sloth bears and can just sprint away.\u00a0\nFor humans, however, outrunning a sloth bear is usually not an option \u2013 not only are humans much slower than tigers, but reports from survivors of attacks suggest that the bears may rush at humans seemingly out of nowhere, before even being noticed.\u00a0\nIf the standing bear then swats at the person, their forelegs and claws make contact with the human face \u2013 our most vulnerable body part, Dharaiya points out.\n\"That's why sloth bear attacks are deadly, and why sloth bears are known as aggressive bears within the bear family,\" he says. \"[They are] actually not more aggressive [than other bears], but the way they attack is more deadly.\"\nThe result can be catastrophic, life-changing injuries. In 2020, a 50-year-old man in Sri Lanka was foraging for tamarind in a forest when he was attacked by a sloth bear whose claws ripped his face off. In a similar case in 2023, a 43-year-old herdsman tending his cattle in Sri Lanka also had his face mauled by a sloth bear. Both men lost their eyesight. In Odisha in eastern India, a man was mauled so badly by a sloth bear that brain matter bulged out of his injured skull \u2013 emergency surgery managed to save his life, according to a 2017 report. The attacks are so explosive that survivors recount not having had any time to react. In the words of a survivor of another attack: \"It happened so fast, I didn't see the bear coming\u2026 just dust, flying leaves, and the screams and roars of the bear.\"\nIn the areas of India Dharaiya and his team study, such as central Gujarat, tribal communities are especially at risk of such unintended clashes.\u00a0\n\"Most of them are forest dwellers. They visit the jungle to collect firewood, timber, fruits and honey, medicinal plants,\" Dharaiya says. \"That's when they come across the bears\", which feed on the same plants and honey, he explains.\nIn particular, the villagers collect the flowers of the madhuca indica tree, which they use to make a traditional wine called mahua.\u00a0\n\"They have to collect this flower of the tree in the early morning, when the sloth bear is also looking for food,\" he says. \"And the same flower, of the same tree, is also the food of sloth bear, so it visits the same area. And because it's early in the morning, and there's less visibility, there's a chance of confrontation.\"\u00a0\nIn one survey of these communities in central Gujarat, most respondents said sloth bears posed a significant risk to human life, and support for the bears' conservation was low among them. Dharaiya and his colleagues at the\u00a0WCB Research Foundation are hoping to change those attitudes. They analyse the attacks and interview survivors to understand the causes, then use the insights to help locals avoid the bears. The measures include educating locals in bear safety, such as making noise when walking to reduce the chances of sudden encounters with bears. The experts also recommend clearing thick bushes and shrubs from field edges and roadsides, to make it easier for bears and humans to spot and avoid each other, and building toilets close to settlements so people don't need to venture into the forest alone as much.\u00a0\nIn addition, the researchers have designed a special anti-sloth-bear stick, equipped with bells and blunt spikes.\nCalled \"ghanti kathi\" in Hindi (meaning \"bell stick\"), the stick's main purpose is to scare off sloth bears and prevent clashes, says Dharaiya. He and his team have distributed 500 of these sticks to tribal communities and forest department staff who patrol the local forests where sloth bears live, he says.\n\"When people use the stick, the bells make a noise that alerts the sloth bear, or any other wild animals,\" he says. \"And even in the worst case, if the sloth bear comes close to a person, the person can deter the animal with the blunt-ended spikes. So the sloth bear will be safe, and the person will be safe.\"\u00a0\nWhile an official evaluation is still under way, Dharaiya says the response so far has been very positive, and that preliminary data suggests it works.\n\"People are saying it helps \u2013 not only with the sloth bear but also with other wild animals,\" including wild boars and leopards, he says, as the noise of the stick scares them away.\u00a0\nDharaiya hopes that as people learn more about the sloth bear, and how to live more safely with it, they will come to see it as an animal worth protecting. In fact, forest field staff surveyed about the sloth bear viewed the animal more positively, compared to ordinary villagers.\n\"The sloth bear is [endemic to] the Indian subcontinent. So it's our responsibility to conserve it,\" he says. \"Sloth bears are the engineers of the forest, they control ant and termite populations, they disperse seeds, they help the fertility of the soil. They're a very important animal in the ecosystem.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook\u00a0and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "New York based trading giant Jane Street has been in the eye of a storm over the past few weeks after India's market regulator banned it from the securities market.\nThe regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has accused Jane Street of indulging in a \"sinister scheme\", alleging that its \"manipulation\" of India's stock market has led to small investors trading at \"unfavourable and misleading prices\".\nJane Street has not responded to the BBC's request for comment, but according to the Financial Times, the firm has told staff in an internal email that it was \"beyond disappointed\" by Sebi's order and planned to challenge it.\nSo what is Jane Street, and what are they accused of?\nJane Street was founded by a small group of traders and technologists in a tiny New York office. It is a quantitative trading firm which uses mathematical models and algorithms to decide trading strategies.\nThe company has more than 3000 employees who trade in a broad range of asset classes across 45 countries. According to the Financial Times, the firm accounted for over 10% of North America's equity trading volume in 2023, making it a significant player on Wall Street.\nIndia's stock market has two main segments. The cash market is where investors buy and sell actual shares of companies, owning a piece of the business. And the derivatives market is where traders use tools like futures and options to bet on stocks or commodities, without owning the underlying shares.\nSebi claims the suspicious trading activity by Jane Street happened on India's Bank Nifty index which tracks the performance of 12 large Indian banks.\nThe regulator alleges that Jane Street operated in both the cash and derivatives market through different entities.\nSo on a very basic level what is alleged is, one entity bought large quantities of bank shares \u2013 pushing up the price of Bank Nifty when the market opened in the morning.\nSimultaneously, it's claimed, the second entity would bet on the decline in Bank Nifty's value in the derivatives market.\nOn the day of expiry - when the contracts are settled in the derivative market - as the trading session inched towards close of day, Jane Street, it's claimed,  dumped the bank shares it bought in the cash market, causing the bank index price to plunge. This, in turn, would pay off the bet taken by its other entity in the derivatives market on a decline in prices, Sebi says. \n\"Such a trade is called 'marking the close' which is considered illegal even in the US,\" says Deepak Shenoy, CEO, Capitalmind Asset Management Pvt Ltd in Bengaluru city.\nMom and pop investors lost money because during the day they'd bought shares at higher levels, as they were pushed up because of the big volumes bought by Jane Street.\nSebi basically said Jane Street's activities created \"a false or misleading appearance of market activity\" and attracted \"unsuspecting\" investors to trade at levels that were \"artificial and temporary\".\nBy doing this, it was enticing unsuspecting investors to trade in Bank Nifty index options at interim levels that were artificial and temporary.\nOn 3 July, in a lengthy order, Sebi concluded that \"the integrity of the market, and the faith of millions of small investors and traders, can no longer be held hostage to the machinations of such an untrustworthy actor\".\nAs per several global media reports, Jane Street has denied all these allegations of wrongdoing and described the trades as \"basic index arbitrage\" - the price differential between the price of a stock in the cash market and its corresponding derivatives contract - saying it plans to challenge SEBI's order.\n\"Index arbitrage is legal and even Indian broking firms have done this for ages and used algorithms and machines to trade in the market. But what they (Jane Street) did is not index arbitrage,\" claims says Mr Shenoy.\n\"What they have done is taken a position in two different markets. And this is not arbitrage. You took X on one side and 7X on other side. You sold that X and gained from 7X. That is the problem,\" he explains.\n\"The same script would play out every week on expiry day when index contracts are settled,\" says Mayank Bansal, a UAE-based investor who operates in India's derivatives market . \"While retail investors lost money expecting a strong finish, Jane Street would have profited by betting on a fall and we are talking of a trade of millions of dollars.\"\n\"It is not illegal to be smarter than your counterparties in a swap transaction. However if you read the allegations made in the Sebi filing, the whole thing appears to stink very badly,\" Alexander Gerko, CEO of XTX, a rival firm of Jane Street, wrote on his LinkedIn account.\nAccording to recent data from the regulator, there are nearly 10 million retail investors in the derivatives market. In FY25 they lost 1.05 trillion rupees ($11.6bn, \u00a38.6bn) up from 750bn rupees in FY24.\nOn average, each retail investor lost 110,069 rupees ($1,283; \u00a3958) last year.\nWhile these losses cannot be attributed to Jane Street directly, Sebi says the firm made $4.3bn from India in a little over two years while small investors were bleeding.\n\"They've rigged the prices for their own convenience,\" a Mumbai-based investor, who didn't want to be named, alleged to the BBC.\n\"On 17 January 2024, Sebi says Jane Street had its most profitable day. I lost nearly $7,000, my worst single-day loss in a year.\"\nThe episode exposes deeper regulatory concerns say experts.\n\"SEBI should have acted before so many people lost their money,\" says Mr Bansal. \"The surveillance systems must be strong enough to detect and stop manipulation in real time. Who knows how many more players are operating like this here,\" he says.\nThe Indian market regulator says Jane Street has deposited just over $560mn in an escrow account with a lien marked in favour of Sebi, requesting it to lift the temporary trading ban.\nSebi says Jane Street's request to remove the trading ban is currently \"under examination\".\nBut under Indian laws, if these allegations of market manipulation are proven, the US trader could face a fine that is up to three times this amount.",

        "article_text": "At the beginning of his first show in years, Indian musician Himesh Reshammiya  - known for his distinct nasal voice - poses a question: \"Should I sing from my mouth or through my nose?\"\n\"Through the nose!\" the crowd responds, their euphoric chants drowning in a blast of orchestral music.\nA splash of synth violins and drums follows, as red lights strobe over the fans gathered at Delhi's Indira Gandhi Arena stadium. And then comes the unmistakable crooning: \"Aashiq banaya aap ne (You have turned me into a lover),\" Reshammiya whispers, his signature twang ringing from every corner. The crowd erupts into screams again.\nBy the end of the night, legions of fans hailed it as the best concert of their lives.\nReshammiya, one of Bollywood's leading composers and singers, has long been a polarising figure in Indian pop culture - mocked for his nasal vocals yet loved for that very uniqueness. \nEven at the peak of his career, when his songs blared from every city, street and gathering of the country, his singing would get associated with poor taste and \"cringe\" sensibilities. \nBut it's this contradiction - along with his ever-evolving persona, unabashed personality, and unapologetic approach to music - that has cemented his cult status. \nA few years ago, he was written off after shifting focus from music to acting - but those career obituaries proved premature.\nNow he is back, singing the same songs in the same style - and yet managing to attract tens of thousands of fans, both old and new.  \nIn Delhi, during two back-to-back shows, his nasal voice stayed sharp, hitting every note flawlessly without missing a beat.\nEverything was intended to evoke nostalgia - the set list was drawn from the late 2000s, during which he released some of his most memorable songs. Fans received replicas of his iconic red cap - glittering with HR initials - worn by Reshammiya along with his signature black leather robes that inspired a fashion subculture.\nBehind him, the production took care of everything else: the energetic dance troupes, sophisticated light and sound backdrops and a full-fledged backing orchestra. \"Are you ready to turn this stadium into a nightclub?\" he roared.\nFans seemed to be on a whole other level of euphoria, jumping out of their seats and breaking into little dances. Some came dressed like him - black cap, black jacket and a cropped beard - and carried banners: \"Love you, Lord Himesh\".\n\"This feels like time travel - these songs were the sound of my teenage life,\" a woman screamed in between the sonic booms of the bass. \nWith each song, even Himesh seemed more unrestrained. At one point he indulged the audience a little: \"They want me to end the show at 10. But don't you want me to sing for you the entire night?\"\nThe impact was disarming. With the success of his concert, Reshammiya had once again taken the tag of \"cringe\" and managed to make it subersively cool. \nHe became not just a man, \"but a lowercase god of post-ironic worship: Lord Himesh. In fact, the whole idea of calling someone 'Lord' is just ironic surrender,\" writes journalist Anurag Minus Verma.\nBut how did he do it?\nBorn in Mumbai into a musical family - his father was a well-known composer and producer - Reshammiya started his career as a TV producer at the age of 17.\nIn his free time, he would compose his own songs. \"I would keep a repository of tunes ready with me, waiting for the right moment to unleash them on the world,\" he said in an interview earlier this year.\nThat moment arrived in 1998, when he made the music for Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya, starring Bollywood star Salman Khan. The film was a roaring success and earned Reshammiya mainstream recognition.\nAs his stature as a composer grew, Reshammaiya famously featured as one of the judges in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, a hugely popular reality TV singing show. It was here that he coined the famous line, \"Jai Mata Di Let's Rock\" - an eclectic war cry that mashed devotion (by invoking a revered Hindu goddess) with rockstar energy, and has become emotional memorabilia for his fans.\nThings seemed to be going a certain direction until 2005, when Reshammiya completely flipped the script with the film Ashiq Banaya Aapne.. \nEnter: the nasal era. Largely a composer until then, Reshammiya sang several songs on the album in a style that was unheard of in Bollywood, although he claimed he sounded nasal because he has a high-pitched voice. \nWhatever it was, the twangy sound flew with the masses. \"Often, the songs were sloppily produced but the words were so emotional and the melodies so catchy, that no one cared,\" says Uzair Iqbal, a Bengaluru-based musician.\nHe even looked younger, swapping his clean-shaven exuberance for a moodier vibe, crooning ballads beneath a cap and shades that hid his face.\nJokes followed him, along with scathing critics who dismissed him as a fleeting trend and his music as corny and repetitive.\nBut with every hit - he had at least 30 in one year - he got closer to challenging these notions. His iconic partnership with actor Emran Hashmi, earned him the moniker \"hit machine\". In 2006, he became the first Indian to perform at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\"Seeing this man own his corniness, his 'nasal' critique felt freeing in a time where perfection is curated to obnoxious levels,\" says Mabel Ghosh, a Delhi-based fan.\nThen at the peak of his stardom, Reshammiya opted for another grandiose reinvention - and turned to acting.\nBy his own admission, it was a bold move, one that turned him into one of the most famously memed figures in India. His stoic stares on screen lent themselves to so many jokes that newspapers wrote articles about it.\nBut he flipped that around too. Between extreme fandom and pouring scorn, Reshammiya took the best from both and turned it into something unique and inordinately fun.\nSo when people made fun of him, he joined in. The most endearing moment happened during the pandemic when videos of him working out - poker-faced and staring right into your soul - sparked waves of jokes online. Instead of getting discouraged, he began to post more.\n\"People wondered what the hell was I doing? I was just vibing with my fans. Enjoy life man, don't take it so seriously,\" he famously said.\nHis films, most of them self-produced, have enjoyed limited success but he stays on course. \"With the right film, I can do wonders. I know people would mock me for saying this, but I know what I am doing.\"\nIt was this same unapologetic attitude that made his show a roaring success too.\nDespite the ridicule, Reshammiya is not interested in chipping away bits of his personality - instead he embraces his quirks, turning them into a commercially successful signature.\n\"Reshammiya is one for the masses, one of the great cultural equalisers in India,\" Mr Ghosh says. \n\"He's been proudly owning his style for years - now his fans are too, even the reluctant and ironic ones.\"\nBack at the concert, two friends were having a conversation. \n\"Why do you think I like his songs this much? Is it nostalgia?\" one of them asks.\n\"Bro, his songs still slap,\" the other responds. \"What else do you need?\"",

Prasidh Krishna bowled the next over. Woakes was able to run a two, then another vital single off the final ball to leave Atkinson with the strike.\nBut Atkinson was bowled by the brilliant Siraj, giving India their narrowest victory in terms of runs in a Test.\nIt left one of the greatest series ever played level at 2-2, concluding 25 days of outstanding sporting theatre.\nAt the end of a fractious series, India broke off from the delirious celebrations to commiserate with Woakes, then embarked on a lap of honour, soaking up a historic win with their jubilant fans.\n'England and India provide most intense, dramatic and emotional finale'\nEngland-India was best Test series since Ashes 2005 - Agnew \nThis video can not be played\n'Here he comes!' - Woakes comes out to bat with arm in sling\nIf the fourth day of this Test was astonishing for its fluctuations and high emotion, the fifth day provided drama that was barely believable.\nEngland's target of 374 represented their second highest successful chase in Tests and the highest ever on this ground. They began Monday on 339-6, 35 adrift.\nJamie Smith and Jamie Overton were being given a torrid time on Sunday before the weather ended play early. England's task instantly looked easier on Monday when Overton pulled Krishna's first ball of the day for four and followed by inside-edging the next delivery past his stumps to the fine-leg fence. \nThe runs required were down to 27, then the pendulum swung once more.\nSmith looked all at sea. He played and missed at his first two balls from Siraj and edged his third. There was a wait to see if Jurel had pouched the catch, but there was no doubt.\nAtkinson edged the first ball he faced, inches short of KL Rahul at second slip. India's fans, comfortably outnumbering the England support, surrounded the ground with noise.\nSiraj charged in again. Overton played all around his pad. Umpire Kumar Dharmasena took so long to raise his finger, Overton had completed a run. The England man was so sure the review would save him, he began to mark his guard, only for the replay to show umpire's call for shaving the leg stump. India were delirious.\nAtkinson was unsure whether to farm the strike or trust Josh Tongue. The sky got darker and floodlights took hold. Tongue was given leg before to Krishna, but the review showed the ball missing leg stump. England still needed 19.\nEngland had added two more when Tongue was bowled by Krishna. There was confusion as to whether Woakes would bat, then came the sight of the 36-year-old walking down the dressing-room stairs with his left arm covered by his England sweater.\nWoakes ultimately never faced a ball, but his bravery will not be forgotten.\nAtkinson's mighty blow off Siraj was parried over the ropes by Akash Deep and left England with 11 to win. India captain Shubman Gill had the decision over bringing in the field to prevent the single, or to protect the boundary. He chose the latter. Woakes was in obvious pain when he shuffled the bye off the final ball of Siraj's over.\nAtkinson dug out Krishna for two to long-on, at the beginning of the next over. India kept the field back. England took another single. They needed seven when Siraj set off once more.\nAtkinson cleared his front leg again, attempting another heave to the leg side, but Siraj's yorker was pinpoint. He ended with 5-104, his effort every bit as heroic as the lion-hearted Woakes.\nThis video can not be played\nAtkinson hits six off Siraj to give England hope\nAfter the memorable fourth day was curtailed by the weather, there were concerns this series would not get the finale it deserves, played to a conclusion in front of empty seats.\nNot a bit of it. The Oval was sold out in advance and spectators made sure they were not late. They were rewarded with the epic ending, one that had echoes of the 2019 World Cup final, Ben Stokes at Headingley in the same year, or England's one-run defeat by New Zealand in Wellington two years ago.\nIt is a superb win for India, who deserve their 2-2 draw. They played this decisive Test without all of Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah and Nitish Kumar Reddy. This series may well be looked back on as the birth of a new team under Gill, who was prolific with the bat.\nEngland were without injured captain Stokes, then had to deal with the injury sustained by Woakes on day one. The home side had a patched up pace attack and first-choice spinner Shoaib Bashir is out with a broken finger.\nThe battered bodies reflects the gruelling nature of a gripping series, arguably the best to take place in this country since the iconic 2005 Ashes.\nWhat started with a stunning England run chase at Headingley moved to Gill's masterful batting at Edgbaston. England were taken to a tetchy victory at Lord's by the Herculean efforts of Stokes, then denied by India's gritty resistance at Old Trafford.\nAt various stages, Bashir bowled with a broken finger, Pant batted with a broken foot and Woakes batted with his dislocated shoulder. Neither team took a backward step and there were a number of flashpoint confrontations.\nBy the end, England missed out on a first series win against India since 2018 and their first win against any team in a five-Test series in the same time period.\nMore importantly, they failed in the first part of what they hoped would have been a glorious double, with the Ashes in Australia to come later this year.\nThe first Test in Perth is on 21 November. Woakes is already a huge doubt, and England face a nervous wait over the talismanic Stokes and key pace bowler Mark Wood.\nBefore then, they have white-ball contests at home to South Africa, then away in Ireland and New Zealand. None will match what we have witnessed over the past seven weeks. What a series.\nThis video can not be played\n'Test cricket isn't going anywhere' - Stokes reflects on India series 'cracker'\nEngland captain Ben Stokes speaking to Test Match Special: \"It's been an incredible series - the commitment and energy has been outstanding. \n\"We're bitterly disappointed we couldn't get the series win but myself being a massive advocate of the game of Test cricket, this series has been an unbelievable advert for it across the world. All the doubters saying it's dying a death, this series has said the opposite.\n\"For us, to come out here and try and chase that total down in the way that we did was outstanding. That never say die, never back down attitude we've installed in the group nearly paid off for us. We couldn't quite get over the line.\"\nIndia captain Shubman Gill: \"It means so much. This was a very hard-fought series. Both teams throwing punches and you could never really predict after day four who was going to win the match. \n\"We are a young team but before the start of the series, we spoke about how we didn't want to be looked at as a young team. We wanted to be a gun team and I think we showed that today.\"\nEngland batter Harry Brook: \"It is a great advert for Test cricket. To rock up with a crowd like this today when we needed 30-odd runs to win is phenomenal.\n\"I don't think we could get support like that in any other series, other than the Ashes.\n\"It has been awesome.

The tone remains optimistic - but the window to strike a deal appears to be narrowing.\n\"The next seven days could determine whether India and the US settle for a limited 'mini-deal' or walk away from the negotiating table  - at least for now,\" says Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who runs Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\nThat uncertainty hinges on a few key flashpoints - none more contentious than agriculture.\n\"There are two real challenges to concluding an initial agreement. First on the list is US access to the Indian market for basic agriculture products. India will need to protect its basic agriculture sector for economic and political reasons,\" Richard Rossow, who tracks India's economy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\nMr Rossow says the \"second issue is India's non-tariff barriers. Issues like India's growing set of 'Quality Control Orders' (QCO) are significant obstacles to US market access and may prove tricky to meaningfully handle in a trade deal\".\nThe US has raised concerns over what it calls India's growing and burdensome import-quality rules. Over 700 QCOs - part of the \"self-reliant India\" push - aim to curb low-quality imports and promote domestic manufacturing. Suman Berry, a senior member of a government think tank Niti Aayog, has also called these rules a \"malign intervention\" that restrict imports and raise costs for domestic medium and small scale industries.\nThe elephant in the room is farm exports. India-US farm trade remains modest at $8bn, with India exporting rice, shrimp and spices, and the US sending nuts, apples and lentils. But as trade talks progress, Washington is eyeing bigger farm exports -  maize, soya bean, cotton and corn - to help narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.\nExperts fear tariff concessions could pressure India to weaken its minimum support prices (MSP) and public procurement - key protections that shield farmers from price crashes by guaranteeing fair prices and stable crop purchases.\n\"No tariff cuts are expected for dairy products or key food grains like rice and wheat, where farm livelihoods are at stake. These categories are politically and economically sensitive, affecting over 700 million people in India's rural economy,\" says Mr Srivastava.\nCuriously, a recent Niti Aayog paper recommends tariff cuts on US farm imports -  including rice, dairy, poultry, corn, apples, almonds and GM soya - under a proposed India-US trade pact. It's unclear, however, whether the proposal reflects official government thinking or remains a policy suggestion on paper.\n\"If the US were to say 'no deal' if India does not include access on basic agriculture, then clearly American expectations were not set correctly. Any democratically-elected government will have political limits to commercial policy choices,\" says Mr Rossow.\nSo what could happen with the deal now?\nExperts like Mr Srivastava believe that the \"more likely outcome is a limited trade pact\" - styled after the US-UK mini trade deal announced on 8 May.\nUnder the proposed deal, India may cut tariffs on a range of industrial goods - including automobiles, a long-standing US demand - and offer limited agricultural access via tariff cuts and quotas on select products like ethanol, almonds, walnuts, apples, raisins, avocados, olive oil, spirits and wine.\nBeyond tariff cuts, the US is likely to push India for large-scale commercial buys -  from oil and LNG to Boeing aircraft, helicopters and nuclear reactors. Washington may also seek FDI easing in multi-brand retail, benefiting firms like Amazon and Walmart, and relaxed rules on re-manufactured goods.\n\"This 'mini-deal', if concluded, would therefore focus on tariff reductions and strategic commitments, leaving broader FTA issues - including services trade, intellectual property (IP) rights and digital regulations - for a future negotiation,\"  says Mr Srivastava.\nAt the start, the India-US trade talks appeared to be grounded in a clear and fair vision.\n\"The two leaders [Trump and Modi] laid out a simple concept in their first summit this year. The US would focus on manufactured goods that are capital-intensive, while India would focus on items that are labour-intensive,\" says Mr Rossow. But things appear to have changed since.\nIf talks collapse, experts believe Trump is unlikely to reinstate the steep 26% tariff rate on India. Instead, a 10% baseline tariff may apply to most Indian imports, on top of existing MFN rates (MFN or Most Favoured Nation rate is the lowest tariff rate that a World Trade Organisation member country levies on another WTO member).\nWhile 57 countries faced these levies in April, only the UK has secured a deal so far. Targeting India specifically could seem unfair. \"Still, with Trump, surprises can't be ruled out,\" says Mr Srivastava.",

        "article_text": "Sloth bears are the world's deadliest bear. As their habitat shrinks, India's forest communities are finding ways to co-exist with them.\nFor the tiger, it must have felt like easy prey: a female sloth bear and her cub, walking away from a watering hole near a safari lodge in India. The tiger stalks the bear through dry scrub, preparing to attack. That's when things take a surprising turn.\nInstead of freezing or trying to escape, the sloth bear whips around, and charges at the startled-looking tiger. The tiger rears and fights back, and a 45-minute-long battle ensues, with the two biting and clawing at each other. Watch the video below to see their ferocious fight.\u00a0\nSloth bears (named due to their long claws and teeth, supposedly resembling a sloth) which live in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, are widely considered among the most aggressive animals on the Indian subcontinent. They are known to charge explosively at anyone they consider a threat \u2013 not just tigers, but also, humans. One study counting large carnivore attacks on humans around the world between 1950 and 2019 found that sloth bear attacks outnumbered all other species, including tigers, lions, wolves and any other bears. There had been 1,337 sloth bear attacks on humans during that period, compared to 1,047 by tigers, 414 by wolves, and only 23 by polar bears, for example. (Though tiger, lion and other big cat attacks on humans are deadlier \u2013 around 65% of them are fatal to humans, whereas around 8% of sloth bear attacks are lethal).\nHowever, sloth bears are also facing many threats themselves, from habitat degradation to retaliation by humans. Their population is declining, and they have been classed as a vulnerable species, with their global population estimated at fewer than 20,000.\u00a0\nThat's not only a problem for the bears themselves \u2013 sloth bears have important benefits as ecosystem engineers who disperse fruit seeds and control termite populations. But research suggests that insights into the sloth bears' behaviour, including how they react to perceived threats, could help keep both humans and sloth bears safer.\nThe ferocity of sloth bears may be surprising given that the bears feed on fruit, termites and ants, and don't prey on mammals. But sloth bears may in fact have evolved their explosive strategy to survive among carnivores such as tigers, according to a 2024 study. \"Explosively charging and attacking a potential threat has served sloth bears well for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years,\" according to the study's authors. Their analysis of 43 encounters between sloth bears and tigers suggests that the scare tactics work: the clashes mostly ended with both sides backing off and the tiger running away largely unharmed.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the fight near the safari lodge, the female sloth bear and the male tiger also turned out to be quite evenly matched opponents, according to the naturalist who observed them.\n\"Tigers are very powerful, but their stamina might not last. And sloth bears are extremely hairy, so the tiger did not get proper grip on the throat of the sloth bear,\" says Akshay Kumar, the chief naturalist and manager of Bamboo Forest Safari Lodge in Tadoba National Park in Maharashtra state in India, who filmed the encounter.\nBy the end, the male tiger was completely tired out, Kumar says: \"He came and sat in the water body, for a couple of hours, just exhausted.\" The sloth bear wandered away. Kumar spotted both the sloth bear and the tiger separately over the following days. \"They looked fine,\" he says.\nFor humans, however, the outcome of such a clash can be far worse. Firstly, unlike tigers, humans are not fast enough to outrun sloth bears. Also, the attacks themselves can be especially damaging to humans as the bears mostly attack the head, and their sharp, long claws can rip off people's faces and gouge out their eyes.\u00a0\n\"There are a lot of issues around human and sloth bear conflicts, and most of those conflicts are about sloth bears attacking humans,\" says Nishith\u00a0Dharaiya, director of the Centre for Wildlife Research at BKNM University in Junagadh, India, and an expert in human-sloth bear conflict. People may retaliate by killing sloth bears, Dharaiya says.\nEncounters between sloth bears and humans are increasing, intensified by habitat loss and degradation. But according to Dharaiya, those clashes are avoidable, based on insights into how, why and when sloth bears attack.\nOne of Dharaiya's key arguments is that sloth bears are actually not necessarily inherently aggressive, or intending to kill. Rather, he describes their deadliness to humans as a somewhat unintended consequence of a defence strategy that's mainly meant to scare the enemy off, for example, when a female bear carrying cubs feels threatened.\u00a0\n\"Whether it's a tiger, lion, leopard, human, the sloth bear initially tries to show itself as bigger than the other animal,\" he explains. \"It stands on its hind legs, and then attacks with its forelegs,\" equipped with long claws, which help them dig for ants as part of their usual feeding habit.\nIn fights with tigers, standing may give the bears an important advantage. In the study analysing videos of bear-tiger battles, almost all sloth bears stood up when the tiger was at close range, and the one sloth bear that did not stand was immediately killed. By contrast, none of the tigers were seriously injured or killed in any of the encounters, probably helped by the fact that they are faster than sloth bears and can just sprint away.\u00a0\nFor humans, however, outrunning a sloth bear is usually not an option \u2013 not only are humans much slower than tigers, but reports from survivors of attacks suggest that the bears may rush at humans seemingly out of nowhere, before even being noticed.\u00a0\nIf the standing bear then swats at the person, their forelegs and claws make contact with the human face \u2013 our most vulnerable body part, Dharaiya points out.\n\"That's why sloth bear attacks are deadly, and why sloth bears are known as aggressive bears within the bear family,\" he says. \"[They are] actually not more aggressive [than other bears], but the way they attack is more deadly.\"\nThe result can be catastrophic, life-changing injuries. In 2020, a 50-year-old man in Sri Lanka was foraging for tamarind in a forest when he was attacked by a sloth bear whose claws ripped his face off. In a similar case in 2023, a 43-year-old herdsman tending his cattle in Sri Lanka also had his face mauled by a sloth bear. Both men lost their eyesight. In Odisha in eastern India, a man was mauled so badly by a sloth bear that brain matter bulged out of his injured skull \u2013 emergency surgery managed to save his life, according to a 2017 report. The attacks are so explosive that survivors recount not having had any time to react. In the words of a survivor of another attack: \"It happened so fast, I didn't see the bear coming\u2026 just dust, flying leaves, and the screams and roars of the bear.\"\nIn the areas of India Dharaiya and his team study, such as central Gujarat, tribal communities are especially at risk of such unintended clashes.\u00a0\n\"Most of them are forest dwellers. They visit the jungle to collect firewood, timber, fruits and honey, medicinal plants,\" Dharaiya says. \"That's when they come across the bears\", which feed on the same plants and honey, he explains.\nIn particular, the villagers collect the flowers of the madhuca indica tree, which they use to make a traditional wine called mahua.\u00a0\n\"They have to collect this flower of the tree in the early morning, when the sloth bear is also looking for food,\" he says. \"And the same flower, of the same tree, is also the food of sloth bear, so it visits the same area. And because it's early in the morning, and there's less visibility, there's a chance of confrontation.\"\u00a0\nIn one survey of these communities in central Gujarat, most respondents said sloth bears posed a significant risk to human life, and support for the bears' conservation was low among them. Dharaiya and his colleagues at the\u00a0WCB Research Foundation are hoping to change those attitudes. They analyse the attacks and interview survivors to understand the causes, then use the insights to help locals avoid the bears. The measures include educating locals in bear safety, such as making noise when walking to reduce the chances of sudden encounters with bears. The experts also recommend clearing thick bushes and shrubs from field edges and roadsides, to make it easier for bears and humans to spot and avoid each other, and building toilets close to settlements so people don't need to venture into the forest alone as much.\u00a0\nIn addition, the researchers have designed a special anti-sloth-bear stick, equipped with bells and blunt spikes.\nCalled \"ghanti kathi\" in Hindi (meaning \"bell stick\"), the stick's main purpose is to scare off sloth bears and prevent clashes, says Dharaiya. He and his team have distributed 500 of these sticks to tribal communities and forest department staff who patrol the local forests where sloth bears live, he says.\n\"When people use the stick, the bells make a noise that alerts the sloth bear, or any other wild animals,\" he says. \"And even in the worst case, if the sloth bear comes close to a person, the person can deter the animal with the blunt-ended spikes. So the sloth bear will be safe, and the person will be safe.\"\u00a0\nWhile an official evaluation is still under way, Dharaiya says the response so far has been very positive, and that preliminary data suggests it works.\n\"People are saying it helps \u2013 not only with the sloth bear but also with other wild animals,\" including wild boars and leopards, he says, as the noise of the stick scares them away.\u00a0\nDharaiya hopes that as people learn more about the sloth bear, and how to live more safely with it, they will come to see it as an animal worth protecting. In fact, forest field staff surveyed about the sloth bear viewed the animal more positively, compared to ordinary villagers.\n\"The sloth bear is [endemic to] the Indian subcontinent. So it's our responsibility to conserve it,\" he says. \"Sloth bears are the engineers of the forest, they control ant and termite populations, they disperse seeds, they help the fertility of the soil. They're a very important animal in the ecosystem.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook\u00a0and Instagram.",

Traditionally they grew cotton, but the returns were poor. \nDroughts in 2001 and 2002 made the situation worse and the Patels knew things had to change. \n\"We realised that we had to start growing something that does not require lot of water,\" Mr Patel says.\nSo, they experimented with potatoes. Initially they tried table potatoes; the kind available in local markets and cooked at home, but the returns weren't much better than cotton.\nSpurred by the arrival of french fry makers in their state, in 2007 they started growing the varieties of potato used by the food industry. It turned out to be a winning strategy.\n\"Since then, no looking back,\" says Mr Patel.\nMr Patel is part of India's rise to potato superpower status. It is already the world's second biggest spud producer.\nBut it's the export market, particularly of french fries, that's really flying. \nGujarat has become India's capital of french fry production, home to huge factories churning out chips, including facilities belonging to Canadian giant McCain Foods and India's biggest maker of French Fries, HyFun Foods.\nFrom Gujarat fries are sent all over over the world. But the most important markets at the moment are in Asia, including the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, according to Devendra K, who has been studying the potato market for many years. \nIn February of this year, monthly exports of Indian frozen fries broke the 20,000 tonnes barrier for the first time. In the year to February, India's fry exports totalled 181,773 tonnes, a 45% increase compared with the previous year.\nThe success is partly down to price.\n\"Indian frozen fries are noted for being competitively priced in the international market,\" says Devendra. \nHe says that in 2024, the average price of Indian fries was even cheaper than those from China. \nFor the french fry makers, it's boom time.\n\"India has emerged as a significant player and exporter due to its abundant agricultural produce, cost-effective manufacturing, and growing focus on quality standards,\" says Haresh Karamchandani, CEO of HyFun Foods.\nHyFun has seven plants processing potatoes in Gujarat with another two coming online by 2026.\n\"Urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and changing lifestyles have promoted the consumption of frozen foods, not only in the household but also in food service establishments,\" says Mr Karamchandani.\nMeeting that demand has required decades of innovation from farmers.\nJitesh Patel studied agriculture at university and has been applying science to farming ever since. \nAlong with friends and family they are continuously trying to improve their potato yield.\n\"We are a well educated bunch of farmers, so we keep trying new methods,\" he says.\nOne of their first innovations, back in 2003, was to switch to a drip system of irrigation, rather than flooding fields with water.\nTo keep the soil productive the fields are rested over the summer, and fertilised with cow manure.\nTheir focus now is finding the perfect potato plant.\n\"We are in the process of experimenting with seeds and soon we will have a new variety,\" he says. \nJain Irrigation Systems is a large agricultural technology company. As well as selling irrigation equipment, it has teams of technicians developing seeds for agriculture, including potato plants.\nThey use a set of techniques known as tissue culture. It's a way of cloning plants, with desirable traits and eliminating disease. \nIt involves growing small pieces of plant tissue in a controlled laboratory environment to create virus-free plantlets. These plantlets can then be used to produce more seed potatoes through methods like taking cuttings.\n\"Potato seeds destined for future seed production undergo meticulous breeding practices under the supervision of breeders,\" says Vijay Singh, vice president of marketing at the company.\nOne issue they are tackling at the moment concerns a variety of potatoes used to make chips. Farmers found that by November the potato crop starts to go brown because of its sugar content. \n\"Companies like us who are into tissue culture are trying to come up with a new variety to overcome the challenges that the industry is facing,\" says Mr Singh.\nWhile Indian farmers are working on improving their yields, investment is needed elsewhere in the frozen food industry.\nIn particular, firms need to be able to store and transport goods at sub-zero temperatures.\nModern cold storage facilities have been built, but more are needed.\n\"Only about 10\u201315% of India's cold storage facilities are suitable for storing frozen foods,\" says Vijay Kumar Nayak, co-founder of Indo Agri Foods, an exporter of  Indian food. \n\"These facilities are unevenly distributed, heavily concentrated in a few states, leaving rural and remote regions severely underserved.\nTransportation is a problem as well. \n\"There is a notable shortage of specialised refrigerated trucks and containers, making temperature-controlled transportation extremely difficult and increasing the risk of spoilage,\" he says. \nA reliable electricity supply is also essential.\n\"Frequent power outages in many parts of the country increase the chances of spoilage and make running a reliable frozen food supply chain a daunting task,\" says Mr Nayak.\n\"Indian companies face intense competition in export markets from countries like China, Thailand and Brazil. These nations benefit from more advanced logistics, infrastructure, and production systems,\" he points out.\nBack at his Gujarat farm Mr Patel is happy that the chip makers moved in. \n\"Gujarat has become a food processing hub. Most of the farmers, including me, have become contract farmers which gives us security and good money for our yield,\" he says.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

To have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.The Trustees of the British MuseumThe figure resembles both a yakshi - a nature spirit - and a Hindu deity,  a pivotal moment during the 1st Century in artistic representationIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses.

        "article_text": "The world's biggest whisky market has long been an enticing prospect for Scotch exporters, but was protected behind 150% tariffs.\nIt was symbolic of India's long-time attachment to developing its own industries behind high barriers to trade, believing that its huge population was a sufficient marketplace in which to develop its economy in its own way.\nFor more than 30 years, the trade barriers have been gradually dismantled.\nIndians have learned that they have skills that can compete globally, notably in IT, pharma, back office processing, and increasingly in manufacturing. \nIt has slowly woken up to the benefits of further lowering obstacles to trade.\nAnd as more people have joined India's middle class, by the hundreds of millions, they have put more pressure on their government to give them access to imported products.\nScotch whisky is one of them, successfully marketed as a signal of prosperity and an international, sophisticated outlook.\nDespite having a 150% tariff and other non-tariff barriers, Indian imports of Scotch have grown to become the biggest national market by volume, overtaking France, while the USA is the biggest by value.\nMuch of India's imported Scotch is in bulk for blending with domestically-produced whiskies, which can be sold at a premium price.\nThe UK-India trade deal struck in early May and being signed between the countries' prime ministers at Chequers on Thursday cuts that tariff in half and then sees it cut to 40% within 10 years.\nThat's still a hefty tariff, while the average Indian tariff on imported UK goods falls from 15% to 3%, and most trade will have no tariffs at all. That includes soft drinks, down from a 33% tariff - an Irn Bru, sahib?\nBut it's a very significant boost to the prospects of selling more branded Scotch and pushing into premium markets for single malts.\nWhat has made the difference that got this deal done?\nOne key to this has been Diageo. With around 40% of Scotch production, it has the brands and the marketing heft that already reach into India's middle class.\nIt has also been crucial to weakening the resistance to tariffs of India's domestic distillers, by becoming the largest of them.\nIt bought the United Distillers empire inherited and expanded by Vijay Mallya, the flamboyant businessman who paid big for Scotch distiller Whyte & Mackay.\nAs his empire collapsed and he hit big legal problems (still unresolved), Diageo took control in 2015, but had to offload Whyte & Mackay to avoid the attention of the competition regulator.\nThus, the company that is the main domestic distiller became the same company that is the biggest winner if tariffs come down.\nOf course, a trade deal is a lot more complex than alcoholic spirits. And they have been less of a concern for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He comes from Gujarat, a state that has long banned consumption or sale of alcohol, with a few exceptions recently put in place.\nHe may reckon on continued Indian obstacles from non-tariff barriers, including labelling, customs delays, retail restrictions, and India's sclerotic legal system, but the trade deal has tried to secure gains on these.\nOne of Mr Modi's personal interests is in the global export of yoga \u2013 the Hindu version rather than its western interpretations.\nAnd among the categories of workers given special measures in the trade deal are yoga teachers, as well as chefs.\nIndia has other, more significant asks of the UK, which have also been a reason for previous British ministers to stall a deal.\nForemost among them has been access for its companies to place Indians into the British labour market. Companies such as Wipro and Tata Consulting Services have vast numbers of IT specialists they can place with clients, but Britain has resisted allowing more in.\nIndian companies have invested in UK subsidiaries and bought British companies, such as Jaguar Land Rover. They also want to be able to place their own people from India in British factories and offices, at least temporarily.\nThe trade deal allows for a smoother process, and more predictable \"locked-in\" work visa rules, for longer periods than they've been able to secure before.\nThe UK government's description of that deal is defensive, emphasising what it will not do \u2013 it won't increase immigration figures, and it will not mean that these migrant workers will have the right to remain in Britain permanently.\nOther parts of the trade deal extend to car trade in both directions, where India's reputation for car manufacturing has greatly improved under Japanese and Korean influence.\nFood and clothing imports with low, or no, tariffs are expected to drive down some costs for British consumers.\nThe total value of this is calculated by the UK government at \u00a36bn of additional investment in the UK, as a stimulus to create 2200 British jobs over its initial 15 years and to add \u00a34.5bn to total output, including a \u00a3190m gain to the Scottish economy.\nThe economic modelling suggests exports from the UK rising by more than \u00a315bn over the projections for trade growth without a deal. In recent years, they've been worth around \u00a311bn.\nThat's a big number, but not huge in terms of economic growth more widely. Its significance lies in being the biggest and most significant deal struck by the UK government since Brexit, when Westminster regained the power to strike deals on trade.\nIt sends a signal. India and the UK are open for business, and touting the gains from freer trade, rather than wanting to put up new barriers. The contrast is clear with the American president, arriving in Britain as Narendra Modi departs.\nThe Scotch whisky industry is very pleased by the India deal, but remains very concerned about the prospect of further barriers to sales in the USA. There is already a 10% tariff.\nThat could have a 25% added to it in July next year, with the end of the suspension of a tariff on single malt whisky, including the more valuable brands.\nThat was introduced as collateral penalty in the dispute over state subsidies for Boeing in the US and Airbus in the EU, with a reciprocal tariff on bourbon heading east, and it was then suspended while Joe Biden was president.\nIt does not require Donald Trump to impose that tariff once more. Unless he chooses to change it, it will automatically return next American Independence Day, 4 July.\nAhead of Sir Keir Starmer's meeting with the US President somewhere in the Aberdeen area, whisky industry source says \"he must not be allowed to leave Scotland without an agreement to avoid that happening\".",

        "article_text": "Gautam Gambhir was appointed India head coach in 2024\nIndia head coach Gautam Gambhir has been involved in a confrontation with Surrey ground staff during a training session before Thursday's fifth and final Test against England at The Oval.\nVideo footage from the net session shows Gambhir pointing his finger at Lee Fortis, Surrey's head of ground staff, and the India coach can be heard shouting \"you can't tell us what to do\" and \"you're just the groundsman, nothing beyond\".\nSpeaking in a news conference afterwards, India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak - who was present during the incident - said the coaches were inspecting the wicket for the Test, and were asked to move away.  \n\"When we were standing on the wicket looking at it, one of the ground staff came and said to stand two and half metres away from here. In my cricketing career I have never seen anybody saying that,\" said Kotak. \n\"Literally he was saying that 'you can go outside the rope' to the head coach and see the wicket. I don't know how you can see. \n\"If someone was brushing their shoes, or somebody is trying to put something on the wicket or somebody wearing spikes - if the curator feels that then fine - but it was a very strange way of saying it.\" \nThis video can not be played\nKotak on Gambhir confrontation with Surrey ground staff at The Oval\nKotak continued: \"Curators are a little over-protective or possessive about the square and the ground. [They] need to understand that the people they are talking to are highly skilled and intelligent people. \n\"When you are working with very intelligent and highly skilled people, if you sound a bit arrogant, you can be protective - but at the end of the day it's a cricket pitch. It's not an antique that you can't touch because it's 200 years old and it can be broken. That's what I feel.\"\nWith no specific outdoor practice area, India used three practice wickets surrounded by nets close to the Test match pitch, which is standard procedure.\nBBC Sport asked Surrey for a comment but the club declined, though in a video Fortis later downplayed the incident, telling Indian media \"there's nothing to speak about. There's nothing to hide here\".\nThe incident is the latest in a heated and competitive series between the two sides, with the fourth Test at Old Trafford ending with India refusing to shake hands for the draw early as Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar reached centuries. \nIndia skipper Shubman Gill also said England were acting \"against the spirit of cricket\" with time-wasting tactics during the third Test at Lord's.\nEngland lead the five-match series 2-1 and Ben Stokes' side are expected to make changes to the team from Manchester's draw, particularly to the bowling line-up after just three days in between Tests. \nJamie Overton, Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue are the spare quicks in the squad after Stokes struggled with various niggles. Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse have played all four matches so far and Jofra Archer has played back-to-back after making his comeback from a four-year injury absence.\nMeanwhile India will be without wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant because of a fractured foot and they also have a decision to make on pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who has played the maximum three Tests they stated he would before the series.\nShow of Mancunian grit could be making of India captain Gill\nNo-one can stop Stokes overdoing it but himself - Agnew\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nAnalysis from BBC Sport chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt\nGautam Gambhir and Lee Fortis are two forthright characters. In any disagreement, neither would be prepared to cede a blade of grass.\nIt's another example of the high emotion in this series. First the tetchiness at Lord's, then the handshake handbags at Old Trafford, now this. The tension has been ramped up all the way to a live finale at The Oval. This is top-level sport where results matter and those involved care. It's little wonder things have spilled over on occasion.\nThe Oval pitch will be in the spotlight from now on. Historically a place where spinners can expect lots of involvement, that has not been the case recently.\nThere is some speculation England could leave out Liam Dawson. Under Ben Stokes they have been loathe to go into a Test without a frontline spinner - it's only happened once since he took charge.\nIt could all depend on Stokes himself. Battered and bruised after Old Trafford, there are questions over what role he can play this week.\nIf Stokes can bowl as part of a four-man seam attack, Dawson should play. If Stokes' bowling is limited, England might feel they need an extra seamer, so Dawson could miss out.\nThis video can not be played\nTensions rise as fourth Test ends in controversial draw",

Whereas this is the Dukes in England, Tests in India are played with an SG ball, while the Kookaburra is used in Australia.\nThe Dukes, in production since 1760, has long been regarded as a high-quality product but there have been issues in Test and county cricket in recent years.\nIt has been going soft prematurely - long before it should be changed after 80 overs of an innings - and when a ball goes soft taking wickets becomes harder. Bowlers say there is not the same zip off the pitch and fewer edges carry to fielders.\nThe ECB's Professional Game Committee and Cricket Advisory Group analyses data collected in relation to balls across the season. This would include the number of balls changed, along with reports from umpires and captains.\nConversations around the quality of balls have been monitored in recent years and there is an awareness of increased instances of balls becoming softer more quickly but the issue came to a head during the third Test between England and India at Lord's. \nThere were five ball changes during England's first innings, while one was switched after only 10.2 overs on the second morning.\n\"The cricket ball should be like a fine wicketkeeper - barely noticed,\" former England bowler Stuart Broad said.\n\"We are having to talk about the ball too much because it is such an issue and is being changed virtually every innings. Unacceptable. \n\"It has been like this for five years now. Dukes have a problem. They need to fix it.\"\nThe process for making the Dukes remains a traditional one.\nThey are still produced from cork, wound in string, cased in leather and held together by a hand-stitched seam. The cow hides that provide the leather are also dipped in dye, providing further variation.\nJajodia says there could be a number of factors at play. \n\"One is the raw materials which are natural and then has to be moulded and put together by a human being,\" he said.\n\"Obviously the major aspect of a cricket ball is the leather that holds the whole thing together, and if the fibres that form the animal skin has got some sort of weakness or inherent problem that's something we can only find if it fails by further inspection and investigation.\"\nHe added: \"Covid did have a very serious effect on all sorts of businesses. \n\"In the whole process of tanning leather I would expect changes in personnel, whether either they passed away or decided that it was all too difficult. \n\"Also it may be some of the chemicals are not available any more because companies are going out of business. It could be the cattle themselves or it could be the processes.\n\"There is literally almost one tanner left that does cricket ball leather so there's not a choice. You have to work with the tannery to make sure that they produce what you want and by and large they do.\"\nJajodia also believes the modern game, with bigger bats, more sixes and harder playing surfaces may also be a factor.\n\"The unique nature of cricket is that you can't test that ball before it goes into play so therefore, if it fails, it fails in use and at the very highest level it's in the glare of publicity,\" he said.\n\"All we can do to check everything as thoroughly as we can during the whole process of making the ball.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFinn and Cook on issues with balls and other BBC Sport readers' cricket questions\nJajodia has been quoted as saying a new ball should be given to the bowling sides after 65 overs rather than 80 as one possible solution but accepts that may not be popular.\n\"At the end of the day, we've had three Test matches, they've all been good games,\" he said. \"They've been interesting games. \n\"We should be very cautious and not be looking for drastic and dramatic changes. \n\"This is a product that's been going since 1760. There is no snap answer, all you can do is to go through the routine of everything that you do and try and identify.\"\nThere are, of course, alternatives available to the ECB. They do not have a set contract with Dukes and their deal is renewed on an annual basis.\nA hand-stitched ball made by Gunn & Moore is used in county 2nd XI cricket. One reason for this is to provide an alternative to Dukes should it ever be required.\nThe Kookaburra has been controversially trialled in the County Championship since 2023 and is being used for four rounds of matches this season. This was an innovation led by the England team, to help prepare bowlers for overseas conditions.\nIn the two rounds of Championship cricket already played using the Kookaburra this season, an average of 1,194.66 runs were scored per match - a significant increase.\nOne theory for the ineffectiveness of the Kookaburra in this country is it is not suitable to the softer pitches of the UK, as opposed to harder surfaces of the southern hemisphere.\n\"I can assure you we are on the case all of the time,\" Jajodia said.\n\"I spend my life almost producing these balls and I personally pick the balls for each game and when you look at them and they are new they look like works of art, they really are. They're wonderful. \n\"But what you don't know is what it's going to do when it's actually taking hammer and that's the problem with the product.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "In the winter of 1956, The Times correspondent David Holden arrived on the island of Bahrain, then still a British protectorate. \nAfter a short-lived career teaching geography, Holden had looked forward to his Arabian posting, but he hadn't expected to be attending a garden durbar in honour of Queen Victoria's appointment as Empress of India. \nEverywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India. \n\"The Raj maintains here a slightly phantasmal sway,\" wrote Holden, \"a situation rich in anomaly and anachronism\u2026 The servants are all bearers, the laundryman a dhobi, and the watchman a chowkidar,\" he wrote, \"and on Sundays the guests are confronted with the ancient, and agreeable, Anglo-Indian ritual of a mountainous curry lunch.\" \nThe Sultan of Oman, educated in Rajasthan, was more fluent in Urdu than Arabic, while soldiers in the nearby state of Qu'aiti, now eastern Yemen, marched around in now-defunct Hyderabadi army uniforms.\nIn the words of the governor of Aden himself: \n\"One had an extraordinarily powerful impression that all the clocks here had stopped seventy years ago; that the Raj was at its height, Victoria on the throne, Gilbert and Sullivan a fresh and revolutionary phenomenon, and Kipling a dangerous debunker, so strong was the link from Delhi via Hyderabad to the South Arabian shore.\"\nAlthough largely forgotten today, in the early 20th Century, nearly a third of the Arabian Peninsula was ruled as part of the British Indian Empire. \nFrom Aden to Kuwait, a crescent of Arabian protectorates was governed from Delhi, overseen by the Indian Political Service, policed by Indian troops, and answerable to the Viceroy of India.\nUnder the Interpretation Act of 1889, these protectorates had all legally been considered part of India. \nThe standard list of India's semi-independent princely states like Jaipur opened alphabetically with Abu Dhabi, and the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, even suggested that Oman should be treated \"as much a Native State of the Indian Empire as Lus Beyla or Kelat [present day Balochistan]\". \nIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern Yemen, which functioned as India's westernmost port and was administered as part of Bombay Province. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1931, he found many young Arabs identifying as Indian nationalists.\nEven at the time, however, few members of the British or Indian public were aware of this Arabian extension of the British Raj. \nMaps showing the full reach of the Indian Empire were only published in top secrecy, and the Arabian territories were left off public documents to avoid provoking the Ottomans or later the Saudis. \nIndeed, as one Royal Asiatic Society lecturer quipped:\n\"As a jealous sheikh veils his favourite wife, so the British authorities shroud conditions in the Arab states in such thick mystery that ill-disposed propagandists might almost be excused for thinking that something dreadful is going on there.\"\nBut by the 1920s, politics was shifting. Indian nationalists began to imagine India not as an imperial construct but as a cultural space rooted in the geography of the Mahabharata. London saw an opportunity to redraw borders. On 1 April 1937, the first of several imperial partitions was enacted and Aden was separated from India. \nA telegram from King George VI was read aloud:\n\"Aden has been an integral part of British Indian administration for nearly 100 years. That political association with my Indian Empire will now be broken, and Aden will take its place in my Colonial Empire.\"\nThe Gulf remained under the purview of the Government of India for another decade, however. \nBritish officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India.\"\nAs Gulf resident William Hay put it, \"it would clearly have been inappropriate to hand over responsibility for dealing with the Gulf Arabs to Indians or Pakistanis\". \nThe Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.\nMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. \nFew batted an eyelid, and 75 years on, the importance of what had just happened is still not fully understood in either India or the Gulf. \nWithout this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.\nWhen British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. So Britain retained its role in the Gulf for 24 more years, with an 'Arabian Raj' now reporting to Whitehall rather than to the Viceroy of India. \nIn the words of Gulf scholar Paul Rich, this was \"the Indian Empire's last redoubt, just as Goa was Portuguese India's last solitary vestige, or Pondicherry was the tag-end of French India\".\nThe official currency was still the Indian rupee; the easiest mode of transport was still the 'British India Line' (shipping company) and the 30 Arabian princely states were still governed by 'British residents' who had made their careers in the Indian Political Service.\nThe British only finally pulled out of the Gulf in 1971 as part of its decision to abandon colonial commitments east of Suez. \nAs David Holden wrote in July: \n\"For the first time since the heyday of Britain's East India Company, all the territories around the Gulf will be at liberty to seek their own salvation without the threat of British intervention, or the comfort of British protection. This final remnant of the British Raj - for that, in effect, is what it is \u2013 has been for some years now an obvious, if in some ways charming, anachronism \u2026 But its day is over.\"\nOf all the national narratives that emerged after the Empire's collapse, the Gulf states have been most successful at erasing their ties to British India. \nFrom Bahrain to Dubai, a past relationship with Britain is remembered, but governance from Delhi is not. The myth of an ancient sovereignty is crucial to keeping the monarchies alive. Yet private memories persist, particularly of the unimaginable class reversal that the Gulf has seen. \nIn 2009, Gulf scholar Paul Rich recorded an elderly Qatari gentleman who \"still got angry when he related to me the beating he received when as a young boy of seven or eight he stole an orange, a fruit which he had never seen before, from an Indian employee of the British agent\". \n\"The Indians, he said, were a privileged caste during his youth, and it gave him immense pleasure that the tables had turned and they now came to the Gulf as servants.\"\nToday Dubai, once a minor outpost of the Indian Empire with no gun salute, is the glittering centre of the new Middle East. \nFew of the millions of Indians or Pakistanis who live there know that there was a world in which India or Pakistan might have inherited the oil-rich Gulf, just as they did Jaipur, Hyderabad or Bahawalpur. \nA quiet bureaucratic decision, made in the twilight of empire, severed that link. Today, only the echoes remain.\nSam Dalrymple is the author of Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia",

        "article_text": "French fries turned around the fortunes of Jitesh Patel.\nHe comes from a family of farmers in Gujarat in the northwest of India. Traditionally they grew cotton, but the returns were poor. \nDroughts in 2001 and 2002 made the situation worse and the Patels knew things had to change. \n\"We realised that we had to start growing something that does not require lot of water,\" Mr Patel says.\nSo, they experimented with potatoes. Initially they tried table potatoes; the kind available in local markets and cooked at home, but the returns weren't much better than cotton.\nSpurred by the arrival of french fry makers in their state, in 2007 they started growing the varieties of potato used by the food industry. It turned out to be a winning strategy.\n\"Since then, no looking back,\" says Mr Patel.\nMr Patel is part of India's rise to potato superpower status. It is already the world's second biggest spud producer.\nBut it's the export market, particularly of french fries, that's really flying. \nGujarat has become India's capital of french fry production, home to huge factories churning out chips, including facilities belonging to Canadian giant McCain Foods and India's biggest maker of French Fries, HyFun Foods.\nFrom Gujarat fries are sent all over over the world. But the most important markets at the moment are in Asia, including the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, according to Devendra K, who has been studying the potato market for many years. \nIn February of this year, monthly exports of Indian frozen fries broke the 20,000 tonnes barrier for the first time. In the year to February, India's fry exports totalled 181,773 tonnes, a 45% increase compared with the previous year.\nThe success is partly down to price.\n\"Indian frozen fries are noted for being competitively priced in the international market,\" says Devendra. \nHe says that in 2024, the average price of Indian fries was even cheaper than those from China. \nFor the french fry makers, it's boom time.\n\"India has emerged as a significant player and exporter due to its abundant agricultural produce, cost-effective manufacturing, and growing focus on quality standards,\" says Haresh Karamchandani, CEO of HyFun Foods.\nHyFun has seven plants processing potatoes in Gujarat with another two coming online by 2026.\n\"Urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and changing lifestyles have promoted the consumption of frozen foods, not only in the household but also in food service establishments,\" says Mr Karamchandani.\nMeeting that demand has required decades of innovation from farmers.\nJitesh Patel studied agriculture at university and has been applying science to farming ever since. \nAlong with friends and family they are continuously trying to improve their potato yield.\n\"We are a well educated bunch of farmers, so we keep trying new methods,\" he says.\nOne of their first innovations, back in 2003, was to switch to a drip system of irrigation, rather than flooding fields with water.\nTo keep the soil productive the fields are rested over the summer, and fertilised with cow manure.\nTheir focus now is finding the perfect potato plant.\n\"We are in the process of experimenting with seeds and soon we will have a new variety,\" he says. \nJain Irrigation Systems is a large agricultural technology company. As well as selling irrigation equipment, it has teams of technicians developing seeds for agriculture, including potato plants.\nThey use a set of techniques known as tissue culture. It's a way of cloning plants, with desirable traits and eliminating disease. \nIt involves growing small pieces of plant tissue in a controlled laboratory environment to create virus-free plantlets. These plantlets can then be used to produce more seed potatoes through methods like taking cuttings.\n\"Potato seeds destined for future seed production undergo meticulous breeding practices under the supervision of breeders,\" says Vijay Singh, vice president of marketing at the company.\nOne issue they are tackling at the moment concerns a variety of potatoes used to make chips. Farmers found that by November the potato crop starts to go brown because of its sugar content. \n\"Companies like us who are into tissue culture are trying to come up with a new variety to overcome the challenges that the industry is facing,\" says Mr Singh.\nWhile Indian farmers are working on improving their yields, investment is needed elsewhere in the frozen food industry.\nIn particular, firms need to be able to store and transport goods at sub-zero temperatures.\nModern cold storage facilities have been built, but more are needed.\n\"Only about 10\u201315% of India's cold storage facilities are suitable for storing frozen foods,\" says Vijay Kumar Nayak, co-founder of Indo Agri Foods, an exporter of  Indian food. \n\"These facilities are unevenly distributed, heavily concentrated in a few states, leaving rural and remote regions severely underserved.\nTransportation is a problem as well. \n\"There is a notable shortage of specialised refrigerated trucks and containers, making temperature-controlled transportation extremely difficult and increasing the risk of spoilage,\" he says. \nA reliable electricity supply is also essential.\n\"Frequent power outages in many parts of the country increase the chances of spoilage and make running a reliable frozen food supply chain a daunting task,\" says Mr Nayak.\n\"Indian companies face intense competition in export markets from countries like China, Thailand and Brazil. These nations benefit from more advanced logistics, infrastructure, and production systems,\" he points out.\nBack at his Gujarat farm Mr Patel is happy that the chip makers moved in. \n\"Gujarat has become a food processing hub. Most of the farmers, including me, have become contract farmers which gives us security and good money for our yield,\" he says.",

Her strike-rate was 180 but there was no slogging, just a succession of classical cricket shots executed to near-perfection.\nSumptuous drives both down the ground and through the covers, masterful sweeps and some crunching pull shots - whatever England threw at her, Mandhana had the answer.\nA false shot percentage of only 10% does not necessarily mean the other 90% came slap bang out of the middle of the bat but it felt that way as ball after ball raced towards the boundary.\nIt came as something of a shock when she was caught with four balls left in the innings, having scored a run fewer than England's XI managed combined, but the damage had been done.\nJust one game into the series and the world's leading batter has made her mark.\nIndia thrash England by 97 runs in first T20 - as it happened\nSciver-Brunt relinquishes Trent Rockets captaincy\nIndia women in England 2025\nThis video can not be played\nTwo wickets in two balls for India\nFollowing a chastening Ashes defeat by Australia over the winter, England's comfortable series wins over the West Indies were exactly what was needed to bring back some positivity back at the start of a new regime.\nAll the talk from England was that tougher challenges would come. Well, the first of them has just arrived.\nA misfield from Ecclestone to allow a single off the first ball of the match set the tone for a sub-par fielding effort in which they gave Mandhana a costly early let off and Danni Wyatt-Hodge dropped a fairly straightforward at deep mid-wicket to give Deol a life on 26.\nWith India taking the game to England, the hosts offered little by way of response.\nThe bowlers, both seam and spin, were leaking runs while offering next to no wicket-taking threat. A less than ideal combination.\nAcross the innings, only 18 balls bowled by England would have hit the stumps - that's just 14.5% - and just four of those deliveries came from the seamers.\nThere is some mitigation in the fact they attempted to bowl wide yorkers for a time in the second part of India's innings but given former England seamer Katherine Sciver-Brunt told BBC Test Match Special that she'd expect between 60 and 70% of balls to be hitting the stumps in a T20, 14.5% is remarkably low.\nAttempting the second-highest chase in women's T20I history was always going to be a challenge but it is the manner of England's collapse that may concern them.\nEight of the 10 wickets fell to spin. An all too familiar failing for this side.\nSince the start of 2023, England's batters average 18.4 against spin in T20Is against India and Australia, only Pakistan (13.2) and Bangladesh (11.6) average less.\nWith a 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka to come this autumn, it is a problem that needs to be addressed with some urgency.\nThe nature of T20 cricket means that England could quite easily hit back with an equally convincing win in the second T20.\nBut, with a stated aim to challenge Australia and become the best team in the world, Edwards and co will know that such goals will not be achieved overnight - this result was proof of that.\nThis video can not be played\nThe best shots from Sciver-Brunt reaching 50\nEngland captain Nat Sciver-Brunt talking to BBC Test Match Special: \"India are such a good side and when you give a few chances to one of the best batters in the world, it's very difficult to stop.\n\"You're not going to win every game so you have to take the learnings, the things we did well and the things we want to improve on.\n\"Small moments can change the game. T20 can change so quickly, a catch taken and things can be turned around.\n\"The message will to not be too disheartened and keep doing the things we've done well for a long period of time.\"\nIndia captain and player of the match Smriti Mandhana:\u00a0\"Me and one of my team-mates talked before the tour and said it was time I got a century.

Her strike-rate was 180 but there was no slogging, just a succession of classical cricket shots executed to near-perfection.Sumptuous drives both down the ground and through the covers, masterful sweeps and some crunching pull shots - whatever England threw at her, Mandhana had the answer.A false shot percentage of only 10% does not necessarily mean the other 90% came slap bang out of the middle of the bat but it felt that way as ball after ball raced towards the boundary.It came as something of a shock when she was caught with four balls left in the innings, having scored a run fewer than England's XI managed combined, but the damage had been done.Just one game into the series and the world's leading batter has made her mark.India thrash England by 97 runs in first T20 - as it happenedSciver-Brunt relinquishes Trent Rockets captaincyPublished21 hours agoIndia women in England 2025Published20 hours agoBack to reality for EnglandTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Two wickets in two balls for IndiaFollowing a chastening Ashes defeat by Australia over the winter, England's comfortable series wins over the West Indies were exactly what was needed to bring back some positivity back at the start of a new regime.All the talk from England was that tougher challenges would come.

An all too familiar failing for this side.Since the start of 2023, England's batters average 18.4 against spin in T20Is against India and Australia, only Pakistan (13.2) and Bangladesh (11.6) average less.With a 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka to come this autumn, it is a problem that needs to be addressed with some urgency.The nature of T20 cricket means that England could quite easily hit back with an equally convincing win in the second T20.But, with a stated aim to challenge Australia and become the best team in the world, Edwards and co will know that such goals will not be achieved overnight - this result was proof of that.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, The best shots from Sciver-Brunt reaching 50'Small moments can change the game' - what they saidEngland captain Nat Sciver-Brunt talking to BBC Test Match Special: \"India are such a good side and when you give a few chances to one of the best batters in the world, it's very difficult to stop. A less than ideal combination.Across the innings, only 18 balls bowled by England would have hit the stumps - that's just 14.5% - and just four of those deliveries came from the seamers.There is some mitigation in the fact they attempted to bowl wide yorkers for a time in the second part of India's innings but given former England seamer Katherine Sciver-Brunt told BBC Test Match Special that she'd expect between 60 and 70% of balls to be hitting the stumps in a T20, 14.5% is remarkably low.Attempting the second-highest chase in women's T20I history was always going to be a challenge but it is the manner of England's collapse that may concern them.Eight of the 10 wickets fell to spin.",

        "article_text": "I first faced Jasprit Bumrah in a club match when he was still a teenager, long before he became my India team-mate.\nThere were other bowlers playing in the game who had played first-class cricket but he was just different.\nThese days, as we have seen through the current Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, he is a complete bowler, but back then the main thing about him was his pace. He was rapid.\nThroughout the following years he began to make his name in the Indian Premier League but before he played his first Test in Cape Town in South Africa in 2018, there were still a lot of question marks around him in India.\nHis action was unique, people questioned whether he would be able to swing the red ball or if he had the consistency and control for the longer format.\nHe may have only taken four wickets in that first Test but he answered all of those questions.\nI remember standing at first slip with Virat Kohli next to me at second and Shikhar Dhawan at third. We were all saying how it just felt unlike any of the other bowlers.\nWe had Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya playing in that game but again he felt different. Shami was quick but Bumrah was quicker.\nI stood at first slip a lot to Bumrah in my career. It was totally unique.\nMuch is made about the angle created by his action and his position wide on the crease being difficult for batters but it is tricky for slip fielders too.\nThe angles he creates means the wicketkeeper has to stand almost behind the stumps against right-handers, rather than on a fourth stump line. That meant I had to move further over to close the gap.\nIt always felt like you are seeing him jog in from straight on. When you add in his skiddy trajectory everything just felt quicker.\nBumrah would never shout at a slip fielder for dropping a catch \u2013 he is too nice a guy for that \u2013 but we did joke with him.\nOff the field Jasprit is an introvert. He spends a lot of time in his room. It is not in a bad way. He just enjoys his own company.\nThere was a group of us \u2013 myself, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant and former wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha \u2013 who would always be playing Fifa on the PlayStation while on tour and whenever we invited Jasprit it was hard work getting him there.\nIn the end we had to joke that we wouldn't take any catches off his bowling if he didn't come.\nBumrah needed the help of a good partner when playing Fifa - as a gamer he's not up to much - but it was on his first tour of England in 2018 when he went up another level as a bowler.\nBy the time we went to Australia the following winter we realised he was our wildcard that would play for India a very long time. He was instrumental as we won in Australia for the first time.\nYou may remember on that tour of England a hooping inswinger he bowled to Keaton Jennings who was out lbw without playing a shot. England's batters just could not read his swing and, using the Dukes ball for the first time, when he got it to move, it moved a long way.\nBumrah has taken 217 wickets in just 47 Tests\nIf I had bowled a ball like that one to Jennings I would have been running around celebrating and talking about it for ages. Jasprit stayed cool and didn't ever brag.\nHe just gets on with the next delivery.\nIn the dressing room he is always watching the game. Most fast bowlers come off the field and relax with their feet up. He does relax but he always has an eye on the field.\nWhen I used to sit next to him he would always be giving an input on what our batters or the opposition could be doing differently, which is why he was viewed as a candidate to be captain before India appointed Shubman Gill.\nMost people talk about Bumrah's skills with the ball, his angle or his action but his biggest strength is often overlooked.\nHe has a brilliant cricket brain which comes from his time in the IPL. There he worked with people like former Sri Lanka bowler Lasith Malinga and has gained the skills to outsmart a batter.\nHis first instinct is always to bowl his best ball but if a batter gets in he knows all of their strengths and weaknesses. He has taken the skills from white-ball cricket to become the complete Test bowler.\nOne of my favourite moments on that England tour in 2018 came in Southampton when Jasprit helped me get through to a hundred in the first innings.\nI was on 96 when he came out at number 11 and I have to admit I did not think I would get there but he walked in and said \"I will defend. I don't know if I will survive but I will do my best\".\nI ended up finishing on 132 not out as we put on 46 for the last wicket.\nThat day sums him up because whether batting or bowling he is a very competitive cricketer.\nWhen it comes to his bowling, no matter the situation of the game, he always wants and believes he can get a wicket.\nUltimately, he is the perfect team man.\nCheteshwar Pujara was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew Henry\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "An Air India passenger plane bound for London's Gatwick airport crashed shortly after taking off in Ahmedabad, western India, on 12 June, killing 260 people.\nThe crash killed 242 people on board the flight and 19 others on the ground, with only one survivor from the plane.\nA preliminary report into the investigation, published on 12 July in India, found that just seconds after take-off, fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. \nThe circumstances around how or why that happened remain unclear. Here is what we know so far.\n\nAir India flight AI171 left Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport just before 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT) on Thursday 12 June, Air India said.\nIt was scheduled to land at London Gatwick at 18:25 BST.\nThe flight was airborne for less than 40 seconds. One of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane crashed in a crowded neighbourhood.\nThe plane plummeted into a building used as doctors' accommodation at the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College and Civil Hospital, causing an explosion. It was lunch break at the hostel when parts of the aircraft crashed through the roof of the dining hall. \nThe Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data 50 seconds in, per Flightradar24.\nFuel to the engines of the Air India plane involved in a deadly crash was cut off moments after take-off, a preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has found.\nIn recovered cockpit voice recordings, the report said one of the pilots can be heard asking \"why did you cut off?\" - to which the other pilot replied he \"did not do so\".\nThe Gatwick-bound plane was being piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar. The report does not specify which voice is which.\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, both of the plane's fuel control switches moved from the run to the cut-off position in the space of a second, shortly after take-off.\nThe switches are usually only cut off to turn off the engines after landing, or during emergency situations such as an engine fire - rather than during take-off.\nThe cut-off caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report said.\nThe fuel switches then moved back into their normal in-flight position, automatically starting the process of relighting the engines. One engine, the report said, was able to regain thrust - but could not reverse the plane's deceleration.\nOne of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane crashed into the doctors' accommodation.\nThe report said that \"no significant bird activity\" was observed in the vicinity of the plane's flight path. \nThe report also said: \"At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers\".\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin in 2019 highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged, the report said.\nThe issue was not deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation.\nThe same switch design is used in Air India's VT-ANB aircraft which crashed. As the bulletin was advisory, Air India did not perform inspections.\nThere had been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB, the report said.\nAn investigation led by AAIB - with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - is in progress. \nA final, more detailed report is expected in 12 months.\nAn Air India spokesperson said the airline acknowledged receipt of the preliminary report.\n\"We continue to fully co-operate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB,\" the Air India spokesperson added.\nThe crash is a major setback for Air India, which is in the middle of a business turnaround following its privatisation. It was bought out by the Tata Group from the Indian government in 2022.\nThe airline has announced a cut in international operations on its wide-body aircraft as it grapples with several disruptions in the aftermath of the crash.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it would defer to AAIB to provide information about the crashed plane, in adherence with protocol under the UN International Civil Aviation Organization. It also said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board in a statement thanked Indian officials for their co-operation and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing-787 jets or the GE engines.\nAir India confirmed there were 242 passengers and crew members on board the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which has a total of 256 seats.\nThere were 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals, one Canadian and 12 crew on the plane.\n\"I still cannot believe how I made it out alive,\" the sole survivor of the crash, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was sat in seat 11A, told India's state broadcaster DD News.\n\"At first, I thought I was going to die. I managed to open my eyes, unfastened my seat belt and tried to exit the plane.\"\nMr Ramesh said the side of the plane that he was sitting on did not hit the hostel and was closer to the ground floor. \"My door broke down and I saw a small space,\" he said. \"I tried to get out of the plane.\"\nHis brother Ajay was also on the plane but did not survive the crash.\nThe Foreign Office has been in contact with Mr Ramesh \"to offer consular support\", Downing Street said.\nThe aircraft involved was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. \nThe model was launched 14 years ago. Earlier this year, Boeing lauded the fact that it had reached the milestone of carrying one billion passengers.\nAir India operates a fleet of more than 190 planes including 58 Boeing aircraft, according to its website.\nThe crashed 787 Dreamliner was 11 years old and had completed more than 700 flights in the year leading up to the disaster, Flightradar24 data showed. \nAfter the crash, India's aviation regulator ordered safety checks on the airline's entire Boeing-787 fleet.\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation also announced that from 15 June one-time checks of take-off parameters will be implemented for every departure of a Boeing 787-7 or 787-9 plane. Power assurance checks have also been implemented.\nYou can also get in touch by following this link",

        "article_text": "The Keeladi village in India's southern Tamil Nadu state has unearthed archeological finds that have sparked a political and historical battle.\nAmid coconut groves, a series of 15ft (4.5m) deep trenches reveal ancient artefacts buried in layers of soil - fragments of terracotta pots, and traces of long-lost brick structures.\nExperts from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology estimate the artefacts to be 2,000 to 2,500 years old, with the oldest dating back to around 580 BCE. They say these findings challenge and reshape existing narratives about early civilisation in the Indian subcontinent.\nWith politicians, historians, and epigraphists weighing in, Keeladi has moved beyond archaeology, becoming a symbol of state pride and identity amid competing historical narratives.\nYet history enthusiasts say it remains one of modern India's most compelling and accessible discoveries - offering a rare opportunity to deepen our understanding of a shared past.\nKeeladi, a village 12km (7 miles) from Madurai on the banks of the Vaigai river, was one of 100 sites shortlisted for excavation by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) archaeologist Amarnath Ramakrishnan in 2013. \nHe selected a 100-acre site there because of its proximity to ancient Madurai and the earlier discovery of red-and-black pottery ware by a schoolteacher in 1975.\nSince 2014, 10 excavation rounds at Keeladi have uncovered over 15,000 artefacts - burial urns, coins, beads, terracotta pipes and more - from just four of the 100 marked acres. Many are now displayed in a nearby museum.\nAjay Kumar, leading the state archaeology team at Keeladi, says the key finds are elaborate brick structures and water systems - evidence of a 2,500-year-old urban settlement.\n\"This was a literate, urban society where people had separate spaces for habitation, burial practices and industrial work,\" Mr Kumar says, noting it's the first large, well-defined ancient urban settlement found in southern India.\nSince the Indus Valley Civilisation's discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilisation's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.\nSo, the Keeladi finds have sparked excitement across Tamil Nadu and beyond.\nWilliam Daniel, a teacher from neighbouring Kerala, said the discoveries made him feel proud about his heritage.\n\"It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilisation is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],\" he says.\nThe politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep-rooted north-south divide - underscoring how understanding the present requires grappling with the past.\nIndia's first major civilisation - the Indus Valley - emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 and 1300 BCE. After its decline, a second urban phase, the Vedic period, rose in the Gangetic plains, lasting until the 6th Century BCE.\nThis phase saw major cities, powerful kingdoms and the rise of Vedic culture - a foundation for Hinduism. As a result, urbanisation in ancient India is often viewed as a northern phenomenon, with a dominant narrative that the northern Aryans \"civilised\" the Dravidian south.\nThis is especially evident in the mainstream understanding of the spread of literacy. \nIt is believed that the Ashokan Brahmi script - found on Mauryan king Ashoka's rock edicts in northern and central India, dating back to the 3rd Century BCE - is the predecessor of most scripts in South and Southeast Asia.\nEpigraphists like Iravatham Mahadevan and Y Subbarayalu have long held the view that the Tamil Brahmi script - the Tamil language spoken in Tamil Nadu and written in the Brahmi script -  was an offshoot of the Ashokan Brahmi script.\nBut now, archaeologists from the Tamil Nadu state department say that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative.\n\"We have found graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Ashokan Brahmi script. We believe that both scripts developed independently and, perhaps, emerged from the Indus Valley script,\" Mr Kumar says.\nEpigraphist S Rajavelu, former professor of marine archaeology at the Tamil University, agrees with Mr Kumar and says other excavation sites in the state too have unearthed graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE.\nBut some experts say that more research and evidence are needed to conclusively prove the antiquity of the Tamil Brahmi script.\nAnother claim by the state department of archaeology that has ruffled feathers is that the graffiti found on artefacts in Keeladi is similar to that found in the Indus Valley sites.\n\"People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to a period of urbanisation taking place in Keeladi at the same time it was taking place in the Gangetic plains,\" Mr Kumar says, adding that further excavations are needed to fully grasp the settlement's scale.\nBut Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible.\n\"Considering the rudimentary state of travel back then, people from the Indus Valley would not have been able to migrate to the south in such large numbers to set up civilisation,\" he says. He believes the finds in Keeladi can be likened to a small \"settlement\".\nWhile archaeologists debate the findings, politicians are already drawing links between Keeladi and the Indus Valley - some even claim the two existed at the same time or that the Indus Valley was part of an early southern Indian, or Dravidian, civilisation.\nThe controversy over ASI archaeologist Mr Ramakrishnan's transfer - who led the Keeladi excavations - has intensified the site's political tensions.\nIn 2017, after two excavation rounds, the ASI transferred Mr Ramakrishnan, citing protocol. The Tamil Nadu government accused the federal agency of deliberately hindering the digs to undermine Tamil pride.\nThe ASI's request in 2023 for Mr Ramakrishnan to revise his Keeladi report - citing a lack of scientific rigour - has intensified the controversy. He refused, insisting his findings followed standard archaeological methods.\nIn June, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin called the federal government's refusal to publish Mr Ramakrishnan's report an \"onslaught on Tamil culture and pride\". State minister Thangam Thennarasu accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal government of deliberately suppressing information to erase Tamilian history.\nIndia's Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has now clarified that Mr Ramakrishnan's report has not been rejected by the ASI but is \"under review,\" with expert feedback yet to be finalised.\nBack at the the Keeladi museum, children explore exhibits during a school visit while construction continues outside to create an open-air museum at the excavation site.\nJournalist Sowmiya Ashok, author of an upcoming book on Keeladi, recalls the thrill of her first visit.\n\"Uncovering history is a journey to better understand our shared past. Through small clues - like carnelian beads from the northwest or Roman copper coins - Keeladi reveals that our ancestors were far more connected than we realise,\" she says. \n\"The divisions we see today are shaped more by the present than by history.\"\n",

        "article_text": "Parents in several Indian cities, including capital Delhi, are protesting against what they call \"unsustainable\" fee raises by private schools. These increases, they say, are stretching household budgets to a breaking point and taking a toll on their children.\nAaditya Mattey, 14, woke up on 9 May feeling confident about his English exam.\nHis father dropped him off at his school in Indian capital Delhi, but Aaditya never got to write his exam.\n\"Two or three minutes after I entered the class, guards and bouncers asked me to leave the room,\" Aaditya recalls.\nHis father was still standing outside the school gates when Aaditya and a few other students were asked to get on the school bus, which dropped them off at their homes.\nAaditya's name was removed from Delhi Public School Dwarka's rolls after his father refused to pay a recent fee hike which he alleges was arbitrary and unauthorised.\nThe BBC reached out to DPS Dwarka and the Delhi Public School Society - which runs the DPS chain of schools - for comment, but did not receive a response.\nAaditya's case is not an isolated one and DPS is not the only school which is facing allegations of arbitrary fee increase.\nOver the past two months, protests have erupted across Indian cities - from Delhi to Pune to Hyderabad -  as a growing number of parents accuse private schools of imposing steep fee raises. \nIn Delhi, which has emerged as the epicentre of the protests, the issue recently made headlines after DPS Dwarka allegedly confined students in the library, hired security guards to stop them from entering classes and expelled them over unpaid dues. Parents have accused the school of punishing children for financial decisions made by their families.\nGovernment-run schools operate nationwide but often suffer from poor, inconsistent quality, prompting even many low-income families to choose private schools for better opportunities.\nIn Delhi, rules say that private schools on government-leased land must get Directorate of Education (DoE) approval before raising fees and must admit 25% economically weaker or disadvantaged students - a condition tied to their subsidised leases.\nThe BBC has contacted the DoE for comment on the fee rises, which parents have reported to us, but has not received a response.\nSchools, on the other hand, have argued in court and told parents that they are struggling. They cite inflation, rising staff salaries, delayed reimbursements from the government for economically weaker students and the need for infrastructure upgrades as reasons for raising fees.\nDivya Mattey says his son Aaditya's annual fee in 2020 was 93,400 rupees ($1,077; \u00a3802). This, he says, has more than doubled to 189,096 rupees in 2025-26.\nMr Mattey is among dozens of parents who have taken the school to court, alleging it has unlawfully removed students from rolls and harassed families over the fee issue.\n\"We never thought a school of this stature would treat children like this - bar them from classrooms, assign bouncers and make them sit in the library for days,\" he says.\nThe school did not answer the BBC's questions over email and on a phone call. But in court, it reportedly argued that there was no legal obligation to retain students whose fees haven't been paid. According to a report in The Indian Express newspaper, DPS claimed it suffered losses of 490m rupees last year and had to raise fees.\nA notice on the school's website meanwhile accuses \"a small group of parents\" of spreading \"false and malicious information regarding the school fee structure\" in an attempt to \"mislead and create confusion\".\nBut the controversy reflects a broader problem.\nA recent survey by online community platform LocalCircles found that more than 80% of parents with children in private schools said fees had increased by over 10% this academic year. In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, the rise in some schools was as high as 30%.\nIndia has no centralised regulation for private schools; each state sets its own rules.\nFor example, Maharashtra allows a 15% fee rise every two years - subject to review if 25% of parents object - while Karnataka permits a 10% annual increase with audit justification. Enforcement, however, is weak, and legal disputes over fees often drag on for years, providing little timely relief to families.\nGagandeep Singh, whose son attends Mira Model School in West Delhi, says fees rose 45% last year and over 10% this year.\nSingh is willing to pay the earlier DoE-approved fee, but says the school has refused his cheque for the current term, which began nearly three months ago.\nThe BBC reached out to Mira Model School but received no response.\n\"It's not our job to regulate schools,\" Mr Singh says. \"That's what the government is supposed to do.\"\nMeanwhile, many parents fear that the DPS case has set a troubling precedent.\n\"We don't want our children to be thrown out of their classes, like what happened there,\" says Pankaj Gupta, whose son studies at Delhi's Maharaja Agarsain Public School.\nMr Gupta said the school increased fees by 25% this year without advance notice.\n\"We had no choice. We had to pay,\" he added.\nMr Gupta runs a small convenience store but has faced declining sales since the pandemic. The rise of online shopping has further squeezed physical stores. Now, rising school fees are pushing his family to the brink.\nThe BBC has reached out to Maharaja Agarsain Public School for comment.\nAnother parent, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she's considering withdrawing her son from the school he attended since childhood due to an \"unsustainable\" 30% fee hike this year.\n\"Both my husband and I work, but our salaries haven't gone up significantly. As a parent, you try to give your child the best but sometimes that comes at great personal cost,\" she said.\nBut she admits that switching schools also feels risky - what if the next one also increases fees?\n\"It's the same situation everywhere,\" she said.\nThe uproar has prompted the Delhi government to act.\nOn 10 June the state cabinet approved the Delhi School Education (Transparency in Fixation and Regulation of Fees) Ordinance, 2025, pending the Lieutenant Governor's approval - necessary for it to become a law.\nThough not yet public, Education Minister Ashish Sood says it will tighten private school fee regulations.\nBut parents are demanding greater transparency. Last weekend, hundreds protested in Delhi, urging the government to consider their feedback when drafting the bill.\nShikha Sharma Bagga, Supreme Court lawyer and secretary of a group called Justice for All, urges timely audits: \"Schools' finances must be audited before each academic year so parents know what they're paying for.\"\nBack in Dwarka, Aaditya is still trying to get back to class.\nMedia reports say DPS Dwarka has agreed to reinstate students expelled for not paying fees. But Mr Mattey says they are still waiting.\n\"The school has shown some reciprocation, but to this date my child's name is not back on the register,\" he says, adding that he hasn't received any assignments for the current academic session.\n\"My son is only 14. He should be focusing on his studies, not worrying about whether he'll be allowed to sit in class tomorrow.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Sloth bears are the world's deadliest bear. As their habitat shrinks, India's forest communities are finding ways to co-exist with them.\nFor the tiger, it must have felt like easy prey: a female sloth bear and her cub, walking away from a watering hole near a safari lodge in India. The tiger stalks the bear through dry scrub, preparing to attack. That's when things take a surprising turn.\nInstead of freezing or trying to escape, the sloth bear whips around, and charges at the startled-looking tiger. The tiger rears and fights back, and a 45-minute-long battle ensues, with the two biting and clawing at each other. Watch the video below to see their ferocious fight.\u00a0\nSloth bears (named due to their long claws and teeth, supposedly resembling a sloth) which live in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, are widely considered among the most aggressive animals on the Indian subcontinent. They are known to charge explosively at anyone they consider a threat \u2013 not just tigers, but also, humans. One study counting large carnivore attacks on humans around the world between 1950 and 2019 found that sloth bear attacks outnumbered all other species, including tigers, lions, wolves and any other bears. There had been 1,337 sloth bear attacks on humans during that period, compared to 1,047 by tigers, 414 by wolves, and only 23 by polar bears, for example. (Though tiger, lion and other big cat attacks on humans are deadlier \u2013 around 65% of them are fatal to humans, whereas around 8% of sloth bear attacks are lethal).\nHowever, sloth bears are also facing many threats themselves, from habitat degradation to retaliation by humans. Their population is declining, and they have been classed as a vulnerable species, with their global population estimated at fewer than 20,000.\u00a0\nThat's not only a problem for the bears themselves \u2013 sloth bears have important benefits as ecosystem engineers who disperse fruit seeds and control termite populations. But research suggests that insights into the sloth bears' behaviour, including how they react to perceived threats, could help keep both humans and sloth bears safer.\nThe ferocity of sloth bears may be surprising given that the bears feed on fruit, termites and ants, and don't prey on mammals. But sloth bears may in fact have evolved their explosive strategy to survive among carnivores such as tigers, according to a 2024 study. \"Explosively charging and attacking a potential threat has served sloth bears well for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years,\" according to the study's authors. Their analysis of 43 encounters between sloth bears and tigers suggests that the scare tactics work: the clashes mostly ended with both sides backing off and the tiger running away largely unharmed.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the fight near the safari lodge, the female sloth bear and the male tiger also turned out to be quite evenly matched opponents, according to the naturalist who observed them.\n\"Tigers are very powerful, but their stamina might not last. And sloth bears are extremely hairy, so the tiger did not get proper grip on the throat of the sloth bear,\" says Akshay Kumar, the chief naturalist and manager of Bamboo Forest Safari Lodge in Tadoba National Park in Maharashtra state in India, who filmed the encounter.\nBy the end, the male tiger was completely tired out, Kumar says: \"He came and sat in the water body, for a couple of hours, just exhausted.\" The sloth bear wandered away. Kumar spotted both the sloth bear and the tiger separately over the following days. \"They looked fine,\" he says.\nFor humans, however, the outcome of such a clash can be far worse. Firstly, unlike tigers, humans are not fast enough to outrun sloth bears. Also, the attacks themselves can be especially damaging to humans as the bears mostly attack the head, and their sharp, long claws can rip off people's faces and gouge out their eyes.\u00a0\n\"There are a lot of issues around human and sloth bear conflicts, and most of those conflicts are about sloth bears attacking humans,\" says Nishith\u00a0Dharaiya, director of the Centre for Wildlife Research at BKNM University in Junagadh, India, and an expert in human-sloth bear conflict. People may retaliate by killing sloth bears, Dharaiya says.\nEncounters between sloth bears and humans are increasing, intensified by habitat loss and degradation. But according to Dharaiya, those clashes are avoidable, based on insights into how, why and when sloth bears attack.\nOne of Dharaiya's key arguments is that sloth bears are actually not necessarily inherently aggressive, or intending to kill. Rather, he describes their deadliness to humans as a somewhat unintended consequence of a defence strategy that's mainly meant to scare the enemy off, for example, when a female bear carrying cubs feels threatened.\u00a0\n\"Whether it's a tiger, lion, leopard, human, the sloth bear initially tries to show itself as bigger than the other animal,\" he explains. \"It stands on its hind legs, and then attacks with its forelegs,\" equipped with long claws, which help them dig for ants as part of their usual feeding habit.\nIn fights with tigers, standing may give the bears an important advantage. In the study analysing videos of bear-tiger battles, almost all sloth bears stood up when the tiger was at close range, and the one sloth bear that did not stand was immediately killed. By contrast, none of the tigers were seriously injured or killed in any of the encounters, probably helped by the fact that they are faster than sloth bears and can just sprint away.\u00a0\nFor humans, however, outrunning a sloth bear is usually not an option \u2013 not only are humans much slower than tigers, but reports from survivors of attacks suggest that the bears may rush at humans seemingly out of nowhere, before even being noticed.\u00a0\nIf the standing bear then swats at the person, their forelegs and claws make contact with the human face \u2013 our most vulnerable body part, Dharaiya points out.\n\"That's why sloth bear attacks are deadly, and why sloth bears are known as aggressive bears within the bear family,\" he says. \"[They are] actually not more aggressive [than other bears], but the way they attack is more deadly.\"\nThe result can be catastrophic, life-changing injuries. In 2020, a 50-year-old man in Sri Lanka was foraging for tamarind in a forest when he was attacked by a sloth bear whose claws ripped his face off. In a similar case in 2023, a 43-year-old herdsman tending his cattle in Sri Lanka also had his face mauled by a sloth bear. Both men lost their eyesight. In Odisha in eastern India, a man was mauled so badly by a sloth bear that brain matter bulged out of his injured skull \u2013 emergency surgery managed to save his life, according to a 2017 report. The attacks are so explosive that survivors recount not having had any time to react. In the words of a survivor of another attack: \"It happened so fast, I didn't see the bear coming\u2026 just dust, flying leaves, and the screams and roars of the bear.\"\nIn the areas of India Dharaiya and his team study, such as central Gujarat, tribal communities are especially at risk of such unintended clashes.\u00a0\n\"Most of them are forest dwellers. They visit the jungle to collect firewood, timber, fruits and honey, medicinal plants,\" Dharaiya says. \"That's when they come across the bears\", which feed on the same plants and honey, he explains.\nIn particular, the villagers collect the flowers of the madhuca indica tree, which they use to make a traditional wine called mahua.\u00a0\n\"They have to collect this flower of the tree in the early morning, when the sloth bear is also looking for food,\" he says. \"And the same flower, of the same tree, is also the food of sloth bear, so it visits the same area. And because it's early in the morning, and there's less visibility, there's a chance of confrontation.\"\u00a0\nIn one survey of these communities in central Gujarat, most respondents said sloth bears posed a significant risk to human life, and support for the bears' conservation was low among them. Dharaiya and his colleagues at the\u00a0WCB Research Foundation are hoping to change those attitudes. They analyse the attacks and interview survivors to understand the causes, then use the insights to help locals avoid the bears. The measures include educating locals in bear safety, such as making noise when walking to reduce the chances of sudden encounters with bears. The experts also recommend clearing thick bushes and shrubs from field edges and roadsides, to make it easier for bears and humans to spot and avoid each other, and building toilets close to settlements so people don't need to venture into the forest alone as much.\u00a0\nIn addition, the researchers have designed a special anti-sloth-bear stick, equipped with bells and blunt spikes.\nCalled \"ghanti kathi\" in Hindi (meaning \"bell stick\"), the stick's main purpose is to scare off sloth bears and prevent clashes, says Dharaiya. He and his team have distributed 500 of these sticks to tribal communities and forest department staff who patrol the local forests where sloth bears live, he says.\n\"When people use the stick, the bells make a noise that alerts the sloth bear, or any other wild animals,\" he says. \"And even in the worst case, if the sloth bear comes close to a person, the person can deter the animal with the blunt-ended spikes. So the sloth bear will be safe, and the person will be safe.\"\u00a0\nWhile an official evaluation is still under way, Dharaiya says the response so far has been very positive, and that preliminary data suggests it works.\n\"People are saying it helps \u2013 not only with the sloth bear but also with other wild animals,\" including wild boars and leopards, he says, as the noise of the stick scares them away.\u00a0\nDharaiya hopes that as people learn more about the sloth bear, and how to live more safely with it, they will come to see it as an animal worth protecting.

        "article_text": "Just how safe are India's skies? \nIt's a question many are asking after June's devastating Air India crash, which killed at least 260 people. The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner went down less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in western India on 12 June.\n\"India's skies have always been safe - in the past and even today,\" said Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, the chief of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - India's aviation safety regulator - in an interview with the BBC.\n\"If you look at global safety metrics, such as those published by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which track the number of accidents per million flights, India consistently performs better than the world average,\" he said. \n\"There were only two years within the 2010\u20132024 period where we exceeded the global average - those were the years when major accidents occurred.\"\nIn August 2020, Air India Express Flight 1344 crashed after skidding off a rain-soaked tabletop runway in Kozhikode, killing 21 people. A decade earlier, in May 2010, Flight 812 from Dubai overshot the runway in Mangalore and plunged into a gorge, leaving 158 dead. June's Air India crash was the third such accident in the country in 15 years.\nWhile such major accidents remain rare, recent headlines have raised fresh concerns. From a Delhi-Srinagar flight that hit severe turbulence, to growing reports of maintenance oversights and training shortfalls, questions around aviation safety are once again in focus.\nThe latest involved SpiceJet, India's fourth-largest and longest-running low-cost airline.\nThe Economic Times newspaper found that the aviation regulator had recently summoned the airline's leadership after a series of alarming findings - not from routine audits, but triggered by a British aviation firm.\nThe newspaper reported that it began earlier this year when two of SpiceJet's De Havilland Q400 turboprops showed premature propeller failures. The airline alerted Dowty Propellers, a GE Aerospace-led UK manufacturer, which found damage to the internal bearings of the propellers.\nEach propeller has bearings with two races, or rings or tracks. In this case, the inner race was damaged. Instead of addressing the root cause, SpiceJet \"reportedly kept applying more grease to the [entire] unit instead of addressing the root cause\". Frustrated by the lack of corrective action, Dowty escalated the issue directly to India's aviation regulator, the newspaper reported.\nThe DGCA's own audit in April \"revealed even more deficiencies, including snag occurrences\", the report said.\nMr Kidwai told the BBC that the \"turboprop propeller issue came to our attention through one of SpiceJet's maintenance organisations\". \n\"We took it up with SpiceJet and we ensured they took corrective action. We also found out that the senior management was not fully aware of the situation. We took action against the various post holders who were supposed to ensure compliance with the original equipment manufacturer and other regulations. We directed SpiceJet to remove them and suspend a few of them which they did,\" he said.\nMore recently, Reuters reported that the aviation watchdog reprimanded Air India's budget carrier in March for delaying mandatory engine part replacements on an Airbus A320 and falsifying records to show compliance. \nAir India Express told the news agency it acknowledged the error to DGCA and undertook \"remedial action and preventive measures\". \nMr Kidwai told the BBC that the information in this case came through \"self-reporting by the airline\".\n\"I would not condone it [the lapses]. But [at least] we have started getting these reports. This came from the airline. Action has been taken in this case. In our audits we have mandated our people to be more alert and see whether there is any lapse and bring it to our attention.\"\nIn May, an IndiGo flight from Delhi to Srinagar faced severe turbulence and hail about 45 minutes after takeoff.\nThe Airbus A321, carrying 222 passengers, reportedly encountered extreme vertical air currents - updrafts followed by downdrafts - that dislodged overhead bins and caused nose damage. The crew declared an emergency and safely landed at Srinagar with no injuries. The regulator launched an investigation, during which two pilots were grounded.\nMr Kidwai told the BBC that the regulator had now \"refined\" its guidelines for pilots flying in turbulent conditions.\nFor instance, if there's significant cloud cover or any weather pattern that poses a risk - and \"we've clearly defined what constitutes such a risk\" - pilots are now required to take specific action a set number of nautical miles before reaching it, he said. \n\"This could include diverting, going around, or taking other appropriate steps.\"\nSince 2020, Indian domestic carriers have reported 2,461 technical faults, according to the federal civil aviation ministry data. IndiGo accounted for over half (1,288), followed by SpiceJet with 633, and Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express with 389 cases, as of January 2025.\n\"Reporting of snags by airlines has gone up. This is good,\" Mr Kidwai said.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm pleased about it. But I do see value in the growing culture of reporting [snags]. It's far better for every snag to be brought to the attention of the authorities than keeping quiet and operating the aircraft.\" \nMr Kidwai said with the number of flights increasing, it's important to \"see whether the turnaround time for flights is adequate for [maintenance] checks or not\".\nTo be sure, demands on the regulator have grown: India has emerged as the third-largest passenger aviation market in the world. Yet, over the past two years, the ministry of civil aviation has faced budget cuts, reflecting a reduced financial priority for the sector.\nToday, the country's scheduled carriers operate nearly 850 aircraft - a significant increase from around 400 just a decade ago.\nThe number of air passengers has more than doubled since 2014\u201315 - from 116 million to 239 million.\nThe number of commercial aerodromes has also seen a substantial rise - from around 60-70 a decade ago to nearly 130-140 today.\n\"In total, including both scheduled and non-scheduled operators, we now have 1,288 aircraft in operation. By the end of the decade, we are projected to operate over 2,000 aircraft,\" Mr Kidwai said. (Non-scheduled operators include charter airlines, private jet operators, air taxis and helicopter services.)\nSo had the latest Air India crash dented the reputation of air travel in India? Mr Kidwai said the data didn't point to that.\n\"We looked at the data to assess whether it had any impact on domestic or international operations. There was no significant drop in traffic. At most, we observed a very marginal dip for a short period, affecting both domestic and international flights, along with a few cancellations,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It's natural for people to feel anxious after such incidents. But over time, as more clarity emerges and the situation is better understood, that anxiety tends to subside. Time is a great healer.\"",

Both greats in their own right.\nBut Tendulkar himself is at pains to point out the influence his predecessor had on Indian cricket and that his legacy should live on.\n\"Tiger Pataudi played a huge role in inspiring many generations and that should never be forgotten,\" he said.\nWith film star looks, charisma and a tactical approach that emboldened a nation, Tiger Pataudi is heralded for changing the mindset of Indian cricket after a period of transition.\nIn Tiger's words, the partition of India in 1947 and the end of British rule had left behind an \"inferiority complex\".\nSpeaking in 2009 he said: \"We had been ruled for almost 200 years, then coming across them on the field, made a lot of Indians feel hesitant.\n\"Before I joined the team, the idea seemed to be let the five days pass somehow.\n\"But the idea of playing the game was to win.\"\nTiger's perspective on \"playing to win\" instilled a more aggressive and positive approach during the 1960s and '70s that fostered a sense of self-belief.\nA faith placed in spinners to spearhead a bowling attack was an uncommon approach at the time.\nAs his country's youngest ever captain, aged 21, his influence was all the more remarkable given he played with vision in just one eye.\nTiger Pataudi played for Sussex Cricket Club 1957-1970, captaining the side in 1966\nTiger was just 11 years old when his father died of a heart attack.\nThe newly crowned 9th Nawab of Pataudi was sent to boarding school at Winchester College in Hampshire (UK).\nIt was within the 14th Century walls of an establishment that carries the motto \"manners makyth man\" that a young Pataudi found his identity through cricket.\nWith over 1,000 runs in a season Tiger had soon broken the school record, surpassing future England captain Douglas Jardine.\nFormer teammate Fred Heatley recounts how the young Indian prince fitted in. \n\"He didn't need to be dependent on what he'd inherited as he had so many skills himself, he regarded everyone as being equal to him.\n\"It was worn extremely lightly, but he wore it with authority.\"\nPataudi's sports master at Winchester College was former Sussex captain Hubert Doggart and he was coached by former leading Sussex batsman George Cox.\nA connection that led to a debut for the county at just 16 years old and the beginning of a 13-year association with \"Good Ol' Sussex By The Sea\".\nHowever, it was a summer's day of July 1961 in Hove that would tragically leave a lasting impact on Tiger.\nTiger Pataudi's car accident as reported in the Evening Argus, Monday, 3 July 1961\nPataudi's education had swapped Winchester for Oxford University \u2013 Balliol College, to study Arabic and French.\nOn the cricket field, Tiger continued to dish out lessons of his own.\nHaving scored a century against rivals Cambridge on debut, by the summer he had racked up 1,216 runs and was on track to break the university record run total for a season - 1307 - which had been set by his own father.\nBut this would be a run chase that came to a sudden halt.\nFollowing a match for Oxford at Sussex, Pataudi was involved in a car crash.\nA shard of glass from the smashed windscreen threatened to shatter the dreams of a young cricketer now blinded in his right eye.\nAs Sussex Cricket chair Jon Filby explains, Pataudi had the option to walk home from a restaurant that was quite close to his hotel but instead jumped in a car with Oxford University teammate Robin Waters.\nAs they turned onto the seafront road a car drove into them, It was an awful accident that had huge ramifications for him.\nWho's to know how great he would have been?\nWhile many feared this would end Tiger's cricket career, remarkably, he was soon back in the nets.\nDefiantly adapting his batting skills \u2013 re-learning the game he loved, as BBC Cricket commentator Prakash Wakankar explains.\n\"Tiger chose to pick the right image of the inside of the two balls he saw when he played.\n\"To be able to go on and get a hundred so soon after his injury \u2013 well, his legend started to grow.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTiger Pataudi: The prince that came to play\nDespite his eye injury, less than six months later Tiger made his Test debut versus England \u2013 aged 20.\nHe scored 103 in just 2.5 hours in the 5th Test in Madras, helping India to its first series win against England.\nThree months later, Pataudi was made captain. India's youngest \u2013  a feat still to be surpassed.\nIndia's first double-century against England (Delhi,1964) and a glorious 148 (Headingly, 1967) are stand-out moments.\nAs was becoming the first captain to lead India to an overseas tour win, in New Zealand.\nBut it was Pataudi's influence on the mindset of his team and the ability to unify a cricketing nation for which he is most remembered.\n\"Tiger was the first Indian captain who gave us the feeling of Indianness, \"according to the late Indian spinner Bishan Bedi, speaking in 2009.\n\"Not playing for Delhi, or for Bombay, Madras or Calcutta\u2026 you're playing for India.

'The idea of playing the game was to win' With film star looks, charisma and a tactical approach that emboldened a nation, Tiger Pataudi is heralded for changing the mindset of Indian cricket after a period of transition.In Tiger's words, the partition of India in 1947 and the end of British rule had left behind an \"inferiority complex\".Speaking in 2009 he said: \"We had been ruled for almost 200 years, then coming across them on the field, made a lot of Indians feel hesitant. \"To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Tiger Pataudi: The prince that came to playDespite his eye injury, less than six months later Tiger made his Test debut versus England \u2013 aged 20.He scored 103 in just 2.5 hours in the 5th Test in Madras, helping India to its first series win against England.Three months later, Pataudi was made captain. \"Pataudi captained his country 40 times, before retiring in 1975.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tiger Pataudi alongside his son and Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan in 2006Aged 70, Pataudi died on the 25 August 2011 after battling lung disease.More recently, the Pataudi family's dynasty is synonymous with the bright lights of Bollywood -with his son, Saif Ali Khan, one of India's leading actors.But it is a legacy built on sporting brilliance and defiance.When the first ever Pataudi medal of excellence is handed to the winning captain in 2025, it is a time to reflect on the influence and impact felt in the past.Tiger Pataudi was the prince who came to play.Related topicsIndiaSussexCricket",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Not often you see Root lose his temper' - tensions begin to simmer on day two\nIndia fast bowler Prasidh Krishna says it was a deliberate tactic to try and disrupt Joe Root when the pair were involved in a heated exchange on the second day of the fifth Test at The Oval. \nThe exact words, which came when Root was yet to get off the mark and played and missed at Krishna, were not picked up by the stump microphones but the England batter was unusually animated in his response. \nKrishna, who took 4-62 as England were bowled out for 247 in their first innings, added that he was also taken by surprise by how it unfolded.\n\"It was the plan [to disrupt him], but I didn't expect the couple of words that I said to get such a big reaction from him,\" he said. \n\"I love the guy that he is, he is a legend of the game. It's just when two people are out there wanting to be a winner and wanting to be the best in that moment.\n\"It was just a small thing, the competitive edge coming out. Both of us are good mates off the field and it was just a bit of banter.\" \nThis video can not be played\nDeep dismisses Duckett for 43 after reverse sweep attempt is edged behind to Jurel\nTensions have been high throughout the series, which the hosts lead 2-1, but are in a tricky situation with India taking a 52-run lead into day three with eight wickets in hand after England dropped three catches late on. \nBefore this Test match started, India coach Gautam Gambhir was involved in a confrontation with The Oval's ground staff, skipper Shubman Gill accused England of going against the spirit of cricket with time-wasting tactics and seamer Mohammed Siraj was fined for his send-off of Ben Duckett during the third Test at Lord's.\nDuckett was involved in another strange incident before Krishna's encounter with Root, as Akash Deep dismissed him for 43 and put his arm around the England opener's shoulder as he walked from the pitch. \n\"I don't think I've ever seen a bowler do that after getting someone out,\" said England assistant coach Marcus Trescothick. \n\"You've seen them having words, we've seen it from both sides in this series. It was just different. \n\"We've seen it in the series already that Ben doesn't do a great deal [in response]. There was probably no need to walk him off in that fashion but the game has been fought in good spirits, there have been some words and arguments along the way but the two teams are still getting on well enough and will continue to do so.\"\nTrescothick also acknowledged India's plan in trying to unsettle Root, who played fluently for his 29 before being pinned lbw by Siraj. \n\"They made a comment, they tried to get after him and spark him up a bit. India tried a different approach and Joe bit back,\" he told BBC Test Match Special.\n\"Normally he laughs and giggles and allows things to happen, but today he chose a different route. Everyone has their own method of dealing with that sort of approach and today Joe bit back, that's fine - it doesn't make any difference.\"\nThis video can not be played\nOn field arguments have added 'spice' to final Test - Vaughan\nEngland hurt by late drops in decisive final Test\nFifth Test, Day 2\nA day for Thorpey\nHaving been bowled out in 51.2 overs with a lead of just 23, England faced a difficult evening session with an already depleted bowling attack having to cope without the injured Chris Woakes.\nA lively morning session saw Gus Atkinson complete a five-wicket haul as England efficiently mopped up India's lower order once more, but despite much-improved consistency from Josh Tongue in particular, the tourists were not drawn into making the same mistakes later in the day. \nThey were also gifted some assistance from England in the field as Yashasvi Jaiswal, who is unbeaten on 51, was dropped on 20 and 40 and Sai Sudharsan was also put down before he was eventually dismissed by Atkinson for 11. \nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan says that England also have not helped their case with their selections. \nBatter Jacob Bethell, 21, is making his first appearance of the series and made just six, having played one red-ball match in seven months. Jamie Overton, 31, came in as England were forced into bowling changes because of a shoulder injury to captain Ben Stokes, and with Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer needing to rest, but he has played only four first-class matches since September 2023.\nOverton took 0-66 in India's first innings, made a duck and is so far wicketless for 22 runs from five overs - though the Sudharsan drop came off his bowling.\n\"The only thing I'd say on England's selection is they've picked people who have played no cricket and to throw them into this hot bed of international cricket, in front of this amount of people and so many watching on TV screens around the world, it isn't an easy game. \n\"It is no surprise they that looked a bit vulnerable out there - because if you're not going to play cricket, you're not going to have your body used to playing cricket.\n\"If you're throwing a 21-year-old into this situation on the back of one first-class match in our summer, I find that absolutely extraordinary. I don't think you're giving a kid the best chance of succeeding at this level.\"\nThis video can not be played\n15 wickets, 342 runs and three late drops - highlights from a chaotic day two\nVaughan added that India were just in front of England in terms of the match position, and former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta was in agreement.\n\"At the end of the day its going to be about pressure and so far in this series this India side have handled pressure well, and it's been a long tour - one more innings to go. You have to keep everything else away and just bat normally.\n\"The pitch will get better, it's just about how you handle it. At Lords, it wasn't handled well, at Old Trafford it was handled very well by India.\" \nMeanwhile former England captain Sir Alastair Cook said: \"I am going England as favourites.

        "article_text": "Warning: This story contains details that some may find disturbing.\nThree weeks after five members of a family in India were brutally killed and allegedly burned alive amid accusations of the practice of witchcraft, the survivors are still trying to come to terms with the tragedy. \nFor Manisha Devi (name changed) of Tetgama village in Bihar state, the night of 6 July has been the darkest in her life.\nAt around 10pm, a belligerent mob gathered outside their relatives' home - by dawn, five people, including a 71-year-old widow Kato Oraon, were dead.\nThe incident in Bihar is not an isolated one. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than 2,500 people, mostly women, were killed in India on suspicion of witchcraft between 2000 and 2016. \nBut the Tetgama murders stand out, as five members of a family were killed together.\nCampaigners say superstition and belief in witchcraft remain widespread among many of India's disadvantaged tribal communities, including those involved in the recent Bihar incident.\nThe alleged murderers and victims all belong to the Oraon tribe and have lived together for generations. But what transpired on the night of 6 July has opened a chasm that is unlikely to be bridged anytime soon.\nTetgama's streets now echo with silence - all the residents, except four of Kato Devi's sons and their families, have fled the village. Some homes are locked, while others appear to have been abandoned in a hurry.\nThe BBC spoke to the victims' relatives, police and officials to piece together what happened on the night of the killings.\nManisha Devi says she heard a commotion and found a large crowd outside the home of Babulal Oraon, the eldest of Kato's five sons who lived nearby.\nMr Oraon, his wife Sita Devi, the couple's son Manjit and daughter-in-law Rani Devi were among those killed. His youngest son, a teenager, is the only survivor.\nPolice in their first information report (FIR), which is available online, have named a villager - Ramdev Oraon - as the main accused. \nThey said Ramdev's son had died about 10 days back after falling sick, but he had allegedly accused Kato Devi and her family of killing his child through witchcraft. It's not clear what the belief was based on. \nPolice say Ramdev is absconding and that they are looking for him.\nOn the night of the killings, Ramdev had allegedly brought his nephew, who appeared seriously unwell, to the victims' house. \nManisha Devi said she saw the teenager lying on the ground and the village exorcist performing some rituals and reciting mantras. \nManisha Devi, another relative and the survivor in his police complaint have alleged that the exorcist \"pronounced Kato Devi and Babulal's wife Sita Devi as witches, blaming them for the death and illness in Ramdev's family\". \n\"Kato was dragged out and given half-an-hour to heal the sick teenager. Sita Devi, who was away visiting her mother in a neighbouring village, was called and asked to return if she wanted to see her family alive,\" she added.\nThe second relative who also witnessed the alleged murders says Kato pleaded with the villagers to see reason, but the mob kept getting angrier. \n\"When Babulal and Manjit tried to intervene, the mob attacked them too. Rani Devi was also assaulted when she attempted to shield her husband,\" she adds. \"When Sita Devi returned with her son, the survivor, they too were assaulted.\" \nThe teenager later told the police that he somehow managed to run away, hide in the darkness and watch as his family was lynched and burned.\nThe police complaint names 23 men and women from the village and \"150 to 200 unnamed people who made up the mob\".\n\"The mob was armed with sticks, rods and sharp weapons. They tied all the five victims with a rope and dragged them to the village pond, assaulting and abusing them all the way,\" it says.\nThe complaint adds that the victims were \"half-dead\" when they were doused with petrol and set on fire, their bodies were packed in sacks and taken away on a tractor.\nA senior police official told reporters the next day that the victims were burned alive and their charred bodies had been recovered from a pond near the village.\nDistrict Magistrate Anshul Kumar also initially said the five were burned alive. But he recently told the BBC that the post-mortem report was inconclusive on the issue.\n\"The report indicates evidence of burn injuries and assault; however, it does not clearly articulate the precise cause of death, whether it was due to burning or whether that occurred post-murder.\"\nShockingly, the night-long violence occurred not very far from the Mufassil police station, located just 7km (4.5 miles) away. \nMr Kumar said the police heard about the incident 11 hours after the mob gathered, and acknowledged that it showed \"there were shortcomings somewhere\" and that \"this was our failure\". But the delay, he added, was \"since the entire community was involved\".\nIn the aftermath, the officer-in-charge was suspended. His replacement Sudin Ram told the BBC that four people, including the exorcist, have been arrested. The others are absconding, he said.\n\"We have invoked laws related to unlawful assembly, rioting, causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons, wrongful restrain, mob lynching and disappearance of evidence of offence,\" Mr Ram said, adding that the guilty could face life imprisonment or the death penalty.\nThe BBC has not been able to speak to the exorcist, who is in custody, or to Ramdev, whose whereabouts are unknown. The survivor is in protective custody at a safe location and receiving counselling, police official Mr Kumar said, adding that he is \"gradually recovering.\"\nHis brothers, who were away working when the attack occurred, are receiving free food and support, he added. They're currently staying with relatives in a nearby village.\nA special investigation team is probing the lynchings, but Mr Kumar said superstition-fuelled hysteria drove the crowd to commit the murders.\nOfficials say this is the area's first such incident, with no prior witchcraft cases ever recorded.\nBut Mira Devi, a local social worker, told the BBC that tribal villages lack education and rely more on exorcists than on doctors or medicine.\nVillage council head Santosh Singh says most children skip school to work at nearby brick kilns with their parents. A local teacher, Indranand Chaudhary, confirmed only three are enrolled - and none attend.\nTetgama, a tribal village 11km from Purnea town, is home to 22 families.\nAcross paddy fields, a villager points to burnt maize stalks - the site of the 6 July tragedy.\nNarrow mud paths lead to the victims' homes. At Babulal Oraon's two-room hut, built from corn stalks, bamboo, and mud, time feels frozen.\nIn the room where Manjit and his newlywed wife Rani Devi slept, the bed is neatly made, with a clean sheet and the mosquito net tucked in.\nManisha Devi sits outside her home, haunted by the senseless murders she and others witnessed that night.\n\"We stood helplessly, watching the victims desperately trying to save themselves. That scene still haunts us,\" one man said.",

        "article_text": "For weeks, a battle over language and identity has been raging in India's richest state, Maharashtra.\nThe row began in April after the Maharashtra government made it compulsory for state-run primary schools to teach Hindi as a third language, apart from English and Marathi (the state's dominant language). This, it said, was in line with a federal policy which mandates that children be taught three languages in school.\nThe National Education Policy (NEP), introduced in 1968, aims to promote and regulate education in India and the government updates it occasionally. The latest iteration of the policy, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government five years ago, is being implemented in stages and has run into controversy earlier. \nThe Maharashtra government's decision met fierce opposition from civil society groups, language activists and opposition leaders who accused it of trying to impose Hindi - predominantly spoken in northern and central Indian states - in the state.\nLanguage is a sensitive issue in India where many states, including Maharashtra, were formed on linguistic lines after independence. The local language is often intrinsically linked to regional pride and identity, and any change to the status quo can be perceived as a threat. For instance, last year, Kannada-language activists in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, held protests demanding that billboards be written in the local language and not just English.\nBut the uneasiness is especially high when it comes to Hindi, the most-spoken language in India. Over the years, steps by various federal governments to promote Hindi have fuelled fears within non-Hindi speaking states that the local culture will be diluted. These worries have been exacerbated by high migration from less-developed Hindi-speaking states to other parts of India, especially the south, in search of jobs.\nAbhay Deshpande, a political analyst, says that these anxieties have increased after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. Top leaders of the BJP - the party is stronger in Hindi-speaking states - have often courted controversy by making remarks about privileging Hindi.\nAs tensions rose in Maharashtra, the state government - ruled by a BJP-led coalition - revoked its decision and appointed a committee to re-examine the three-language policy. But the controversy refuses to die down.\nThe row comes months ahead of the long-overdue municipal polls which are set to be held in the state, including in Mumbai city, home to India's richest municipal corporation. It has sparked a political slugfest between the ruling coalition and opposition parties, with each side accusing the other of playing political games. \nThere have also been reports of violence against non-Marathi speakers in the state.\nIn April, two women in Thane district were allegedly assaulted in their residential complex after they said \"excuse me\" to a man who insisted they speak to him in Marathi.\nThe same month, a security guard in Mumbai was allegedly beaten up by workers from the opposition Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) - a nativist party known for its aggressive brand of politics - after he said that he did not know Marathi.\nIn May, a couple in Mumbai reportedly refused to pay a delivery agent after he declined to speak in Marathi. Last week, a shocking video showing a shop owner being assaulted, allegedly by MNS workers, for not speaking Marathi went viral on social media, sparking outrage.\nWhile the issue seems to have increased societal divisions, it has also brought together two political rivals almost two decades after they parted ways.\nLast week, Uddhav Thackeray, chief of the local opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party and Raj Thackeray, leader of the MNS - the son and nephew, respectively, of Bal Thackeray, patriarch of the erstwhile Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party that gained popularity in Maharashtra in the 1960s with its nativist politics - held a joint rally to oppose alleged Hindi imposition.\nWhile the strength of the truce remains to be seen, experts say that the optics of the cousins putting aside differences to \"protect Marathi pride\" could help their prospects in the upcoming municipal elections.\n\"The issue of Marathi language and culture is close to peoples' hearts,\" says Prashant Dixit, a former political journalist who has reported on the state for over two decades. \"It is an emotive issue, especially for people living in Mumbai, and it has been so since the 1960s,\" he adds.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the erstwhile Shiv Sena, under the leadership of Bal Thackeray, conducted aggressive campaigns against people who had migrated to Mumbai from southern states, accusing them of taking up jobs that should have gone to locals.\nIn the decades after that, migration patterns changed and the party turned its ire towards people from northern states who were migrating to the city in search of economic opportunities. The party blamed migrants from states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for taking away jobs. \nThese tensions look set to continue. According to data from India's last census, there was a 40% increase in Mumbai city's Hindi-speaking population between 2001 and 2011.\nThese Marathi-centric agitations have earlier resonated with voters, especially in Mumbai, and some believe that it could help the Thackeray cousins in the municipal elections as well.  \nHowever, many have criticised this approach.\nAn editorial in the Indian Express newspaper titled 'Slap In Mumbai's Face' argued that politics centred around linguistic identity was \"deeply troubling\" and that its parochialism lent itself to violence, something that \"should have no place in India's most industrialised state\". \nMr Dixit agrees - he thinks that any support garnered by aggressive language agitations is likely to be short-lived. \n\"People want their leaders to deliver on their promises and focus on real progress, in the form of better jobs and policies, so that life is better for everyone,\" he says.",

Row over language turns violent in India's richest state3 days agoShareSaveCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiShareSaveEPA/ShutterstockPolice in Mumbai detain a woman who was participating in a protest this week against alleged injustice to Marathi speakersFor weeks, a battle over language and identity has been raging in India's richest state, Maharashtra.The row began in April after the Maharashtra government made it compulsory for state-run primary schools to teach Hindi as a third language, apart from English and Marathi (the state's dominant language). For instance, last year, Kannada-language activists in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, held protests demanding that billboards be written in the local language and not just English.But the uneasiness is especially high when it comes to Hindi, the most-spoken language in India. The Maharashtra government's decision met fierce opposition from civil society groups, language activists and opposition leaders who accused it of trying to impose Hindi - predominantly spoken in northern and central Indian states - in the state.Language is a sensitive issue in India where many states, including Maharashtra, were formed on linguistic lines after independence.",

        "article_text": "When the preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 - which killed 260 people in June - was released, many hoped it would bring some measure of closure.\nInstead, the 15-page report further stoked speculation. For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.\nSeconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why \"did he cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.\nSeveral speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. \nThe Wall Street Journal and Reuters news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". \nItalian newspaper Corriere della Sera claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".\nSumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.\nUnderstandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.\nLast week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".\nJennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were \"premature and speculative\" and that \u201cinvestigations of this magnitude take time\".  \nBack in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. \nSam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.\nAt the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. \nA Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents several possibilities.\nFor example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. \n\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.\n\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".\n\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"\nInvestigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". \nA glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.\nHowever, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.\nSpeculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.\nThe preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. \nThis selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?\nPeter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.\n\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"\nInvestigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.\n\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.\nAt the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. \nIndian newspapers including the Indian Express flagged a possible electrical fire in the tail as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.\nLast week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".\n\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\". He also pledged to share updates on \"technical or public interest matters\" as they arise.\nSumming up, Mr Pruchnicki said the probe \"boils down to two possibilities - either deliberate action or confusion, or an automation-related issue\".\n\"The report doesn't rush to blame human error or intent; there's no proof it was done intentionally,\" he added.\nIn other words, no smoking gun - just an uneasy wait for answers that may never even fully emerge.",

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

He spent nearly eight days there.\nThe Ax-4 team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.

        "article_text": "Nine years ago, an Indian student vanished into thin air. \nNajeeb Ahmed was studying biotechnology at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, when he mysteriously went missing in October 2016.\nThe night before his disappearance, the then 27-year-old who lived in one of the university's residential hostels was involved in a scuffle with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student group. The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. \nFor years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. \nNow a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. \n\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. \nMr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. \n\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. \n\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"\nBorn in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four. His family made many sacrifices to support his JNU education.\n\"After completing his undergraduate degree, he was adamant that he wanted to study at JNU,\" Ms Nafees said. \n\"I told him you can take admission, but you won't stay in the hostel. You are too naive. But he didn't listen to me.\"\nOn the night of 14 October, 2016, Mr Ahmed reportedly got into a scuffle with a group of students affiliated to ABVP who were campaigning for hostel elections. JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.\nIn his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. \nThe doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.\nAccording to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.\nA CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. \nMs Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. \nFor days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.\nIn November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.\nA month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. \nIn May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. \nA year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. \nThe agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.\nA one million rupees [$11,600; \u00a38,600] reward for information about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. \nThe case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. \nShe alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.\nThe agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.\n\nExplaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.\nThe judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.\n\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.\nThe court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.\nThe order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. \nColin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. \n\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. \nMs Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.\n\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked.  \n\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. \nHowever, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". \nMs Nafees says she's not done fighting. Every 15 October, the day her son vanished, she joins a candle march at JNU in his memory. The hope has dimmed, but the wait continues.\n\"Sometimes I wonder if I should put a nameplate outside our house,\" said Nafees Ahmed, his father. \n\"Our house has been renovated. What if he comes, but can't recognise it?\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "When the preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 - which killed 260 people in June - was released, many hoped it would bring some measure of closure.\nInstead, the 15-page report further stoked speculation. For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.\nSeconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why \"did he cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.\nSeveral speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. \nThe Wall Street Journal and Reuters news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". \nItalian newspaper Corriere della Sera claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".\nSumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.\nUnderstandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.\nLast week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".\nJennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were \"premature and speculative\" and that \u201cinvestigations of this magnitude take time\".  \nBack in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. \nSam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.\nAt the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. \nA Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents several possibilities.\nFor example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. \n\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.\n\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".\n\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"\nInvestigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". \nA glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.\nHowever, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.\nSpeculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.\nThe preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. \nThis selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?\nPeter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.\n\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"\nInvestigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.\n\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.\nAt the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. \nIndian newspapers including the Indian Express flagged a possible electrical fire in the tail as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.\nLast week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".\n\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\".

        "article_text": "It took just a few days for Indian Instagram sensation Babydoll Archi to double her following to 1.4 million, thanks to a couple of viral social media moments.\nOne was a video that showed her in a red sari, dancing seductively to Dame Un Grr \u2013 a Romanian song. And a photo posted on the platform showed her posing with American adult film star Kendra Lust.\nSuddenly everyone wanted to know about her  - and the name Babydoll Archi trended in Google search and  spawned countless memes and fan pages. But there was one issue about to emerge \u2013 there was no real woman behind the online sensation.\nThe Instagram account was fake, although the face it used had uncanny likeness to a real woman - a homemaker in Dibrugarh city in Assam, whom we'll call Sanchi.\nThe truth unravelled after her brother lodged a police complaint. Pratim Bora, Sanchi's ex-boyfriend, was arrested. \nSenior police officer Sizal Agarwal who's heading the investigation told the BBC that Sanchi and Bora had a falling out and the AI likeness he created was to exact \"pure revenge\" on her.\nBora - a mechanical engineer and a self-taught artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast  - used private photos of Sanchi to create a fake profile, Ms Agarwal said.\nBora is in custody and has not made any statements yet. The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak.\nBabydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021. The initial photos were her real pictures that had been morphed, Ms Agarwal said.\n\"As time passed, Bora used tools such as ChatGPT and Dzine to create an AI version. He then populated the handle with deepfake photos and videos.\"\nThe account started picking up likes from last year but it started gaining traction from April this year, she added.\nSanchi is not on social media and she found out about the account only once the mainstream media began profiling Babydoll Archi, describing her as \"an influencer\". Reports speculated that she could be joining the US porn industry - possibly a first for someone from the north-eastern state of Assam. \nThe short two-paragraph complaint to the police submitted by Sanchi's family on the night of 11 July came with printouts of some photos and videos as evidence.\nMs Agarwal says it did not name anyone because they had no idea who could be behind it.\nBabydoll Archi was not an unfamiliar name for the police. Ms Agarwal says they had also seen media reports and comments speculating that she was AI generated, but there had been no suggestion that it was based on a real person.\nOnce they received the complaint, police wrote to Instagram asking for the details of the account's creator.\n\"Once we received information from Instagram, we asked Sanchi if she knew any Pratim Bora. Once she confirmed, we traced his address in the neighbouring district of Tinsukia. We arrested him on the evening of 12 July.\"\nMs Agarwal says the police have \"seized his laptop, mobile phones and hard drives and his bank documents since he had monetised the account\".\n\"The account had 3,000 subscriptions on linktree and we believe he had earned 1m rupees from it. We believe he made 300,000 rupees in just five days before his arrest,\" she added. \nMs Agarwal says Sanchi is \"extremely distraught - but now she and her family are receiving counselling and they are doing better\".\nThere really is no way to prevent something like this from happening, \"but had we acted earlier, we could have prevented it from gaining so much traction\", Ms Agarwal said.\n\"But Sanchi had no idea because she has no social media presence. Her family too had been blocked out from this account. They became aware only once it went viral,\" she added.\nMeta has not responded to the BBC queries on the case, but it generally does not allow posting of nudity or sexual content. And last month, CBS reported that it removed a number of ads promoting AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people. \n\nThe Instagram account of Babydoll Archi, which had 282 posts, is no longer available to public - although social media is replete with her photos and videos and one Instagram account seems to have all of them. The BBC has asked Meta what they are planning to do about it.\nMeghna Bal, AI expert and lawyer, says what happened to Sanchi \"is horrible but almost impossible to prevent\".\nShe can go to the court and seek the right to be forgotten, and a court can order the press reports that named her to be taken down but it's hard to scrub all the trace from the internet.\nWhat happened to Sanchi, she says, is what's always been happening to women, where their photos and videos are circulated as revenge.\n\"It's now a lot easier to do because of AI, but such incidents are still not as common as we expect - or they could be under-reported because of stigma or people being targeted may not even know about it as in the present case,\" Ms Bal says. And people watching it had no incentive to report it to the social media platform or cybercrime portal, she adds.\nIn their complaint against Mr Bora, police have invoked sections of law that deal with sexual harassment, distribution of obscene material, defamation, forgery to harm reputation, cheating by personification and cybercrime. If found guilty, Mr Bora could get up to 10 years in prison.\nThe case which has also led to outrage on social media in recent days has seen some seeking tougher laws to deal with such cases.\nMs Bal believes there are enough laws to take care of such cases, but whether there's scope for new laws to deal with generative AI companies has to be looked at.\n\"But we also have to remember that deepfakes are not necessarily bad and laws have to be carefully crafted because they can be weaponised to chill free speech.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

He spent nearly eight days there.\nThe Ax-4 team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. They will also be taking their countries back to space after four decades.\nA collaboration between Nasa, Isro and the European Space Agency (Esa), Wednesday's flight by Houston-based private company Axiom Space will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket. \nGroup Captain Shukla's inclusion in the mission has generated a huge amount of interest in India and posters of the astronaut have come up in his home city Lucknow. \nDuring their two-week mission, Axiom Space says, the crew would spend most of their time conducting 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nAs he heads into space, Group Captain Shukla says, \"I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.\"\nHowever, some of the other items in his bag will be more tangible.\nThe Indian astronaut has said he would be carrying into space some of his favourite sweets especially-prepared for the mission.\n\"There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halva and moong dal [lentil] halva with me,\" he said at a press conference earlier this month, promising to share the goodies with his fellow astronauts.\nThe calorie-laden sweets, however, will pose no threat to his fitness, according to his sister Shuchi Shukla.\n\"He is a fitness-freak and highly into yoga so I am sure he will balance it,\" she told The Hindustan Times newspaper.\nAt the online press conference, the astronauts, who have been in quarantine to prepare for the trip, showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be \"the fifth crew member\" on Ax-4.\nAccording to Axiom, Joy will be \"more than a cute companion for the Ax-4 crew\" and will travel to space as their \"zero-G [zero-gravity] indicator\".\n\"It will be used as an indicator by the crew, shortly after launch, as a physical confirmation that they have transitioned to microgravity.\"\nUnveiling the five-inch-tall toy, Commander Whitson said the swan, known for its grace and elegance, was chosen for its cultural significance in the countries represented by the crew.\n\"In India, it symbolises wisdom and purity, representing the pursuit of truth. In Poland, the swan stands for purity, loyalty and resilience, while in Hungary, it epitomises loyalty, grace and the beauty of nature.\"\nGroup Captain Shukla added that in Indian culture, a swan is also the vehicle of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning and wisdom.\n\"To carry the swan to space is to carry the pursuit of knowledge, clarity of purpose and grace under pressure,\" he said.\nAxiom Space says Joy was chosen after the crew considered a number of animals, including dinosaurs and lions.

        "article_text": "Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.\nJust seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to \"cut-off\" is a move typically done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power.\nAir India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters. \nInvestigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after take-off. The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data about 50 seconds in, according to the FlightRadar24 website.\nThe preliminary report from the investigation - led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - raises several questions.\nInvestigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they're highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps. \n\"It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,\" a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.\nThat's what makes the Air India case stand out.\nIf one of the pilots was responsible for shutting down the switches, intentionally or not, it \"does beg the question: why\", said Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University.\n\"Was it intentional, or the result of confusion? That seems unlikely, as the pilots reported nothing unusual. \n\"In many cockpit emergencies, pilots may press the wrong buttons or make incorrect selections - but there was no indication of such a situation here, nor any discussion suggesting that the fuel switches were selected by mistake,\" he said.\n\"This kind of error doesn't typically happen without some evident issue.\"\nPeter Goelz, a former managing director of the US's NTSB, said: \"The finding is very disturbing - that a pilot has shut off the fuel switch within seconds of flying.\"\n\"There's likely much more on the cockpit voice recorder than what's been shared. A lone remark like 'why did you cut off the switches' isn't enough,\" he said.\n\"The new details suggest someone in the cockpit shut those valves. The question is, who, and why? Both switches were turned off and then restarted within seconds. \n\"The voice recorder will reveal more: was the flying pilot trying to restart the engines, or the monitoring one?\"\nInvestigators believe the cockpit voice recorder - with audio from pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds - holds the key to this puzzle.\n\"They haven't identified the voices yet, which is crucial. Typically, when the voice recorder is reviewed, people familiar with the pilots are present to help match voices. As of now, we still don't know which pilot turned the switches off and back on,\" said Mr Goelz.\nIn short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed.\nThey also say this underscores the need for cockpit video recorders, as recommended by the NTSB. An over-the-shoulder view would show whose hand was on the cut-off switch. \nBefore boarding Flight 171, both pilots and crew had passed breathalyser tests and had been cleared fit to fly, the report says. The pilots, based in Mumbai, had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had adequate rest.\nBut investigators are also zeroing in on what they describe is an interesting point in the report.\nIt says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nWhile the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.\nThe same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8 aircraft, including Air India's VT-ANB which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory, Air India did not perform the recommended inspections. \nMr Pruchnicki said he's wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.\n\"What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut the fuel supply? When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens? Could the switch just flip itself to off and shut down the engine? If that's the case, it's a really serious issue. If not, that also needs to be explained,\" he said.\nOthers, however, aren't convinced this is a key issue.\n\"I haven't heard of this which appears to be a low-profile FAA issuance. Nor have I heard any complaints [about the fuel switches] from pilots - who are usually quick to speak up. It's worth examining since it's mentioned, but it may just be a distraction,\" said Mr Goelz.\nCapt Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), wonders whether the switches tripped because of a problem with the plane's electronic control unit.\n\"Can the fuel cut-off switches be triggered electronically by the plane's electronic control unit without movement by the pilot? If the fuel cut-off switches tripped electronically, then it's a cause for concern,\" he told the BBC.\nThe report says fuel samples from the refuelling tanks were \"satisfactory\". Experts had earlier suggested fuel contamination as a possible cause of the dual engine failure. Notably, no advisory has been issued for the Boeing 787 or its GE GEnx-1B engines, with mechanical failure ruled out for now pending further investigation.\nIt also said that the aircraft's Ram Air Turbine (RAT) had deployed - a clear sign of a major systems failure - and the landing gear was found in \"down position\" or not retracted.\nThe RAT, a small propeller that extends from the underside of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, acts as an emergency backup generator. It automatically deploys in flight when both engines lose power or if all three hydraulic systems register critically low pressure, supplying limited power to keep essential flight systems operational.\n\"The deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) strongly supports the conclusion that both engines had failed,\" Mr Pruchnicki said.\nA Boeing 787 pilot explained why he thought the landing gear was not retracted.\n\"These days, every time I take off in a 787, I notice the landing gear retraction process closely. By the time the gear handle is pulled, we're already at about 200ft (60.9m), and the entire gear retraction process completes by around 400ft - roughly eight seconds in total, thanks to the aircraft's high-pressure hydraulic system.\" \nThe pilot believes the one flying had no time to think.\n\"When both engines fail and the aircraft starts going down, the reaction goes beyond just being startled - you go numb. In that moment, landing gear isn't your focus. Your mind is on one thing: the flight path. Where can I put this aircraft down safely? And in this case, there simply wasn't enough altitude to work with.\"\nInvestigators say the crew tried to recover, but it happened too fast.\n\"The engines were switched off and then back on. The pilots realised the engines were losing thrust - likely restarting the left one first, followed by the right,\" said Mr  Pruchnicki.\n\"But the right engine didn't have enough time to spool back up, and the thrust was insufficient. Both were eventually set to \"run\", but with the left shut down first and the right too late to recover, it was simply too little, too late.\"\nFamilies and friends of the crash victims had been anxiously awaiting the findings of the preliminary report.\nWhen the report was finally released early on Saturday in India, Imtiyaz Ali, who lost his brother, sister-in-law, and their two young children - read it carefully, only to be disappointed by what he said \"reads like a product description\".\n\"Other than the pilots' final conversation, there's nothing in it that really points to what caused the crash.\"\nHe said he hoped more details would be made public in the months to come.\n\"This matters to us. We want to know exactly what happened. It won't change anything for us now, we continue grieving - just as we have since that day. \n\"But at least we'll have some answers,\" Ali said.",

        "article_text": "Nine years ago, an Indian student vanished into thin air. \nNajeeb Ahmed was studying biotechnology at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, when he mysteriously went missing in October 2016.\nThe night before his disappearance, the then 27-year-old who lived in one of the university's residential hostels was involved in a scuffle with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student group. The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. \nFor years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. \nNow a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. \n\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. \nMr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. \n\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. \n\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"\nBorn in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four. His family made many sacrifices to support his JNU education.\n\"After completing his undergraduate degree, he was adamant that he wanted to study at JNU,\" Ms Nafees said. \n\"I told him you can take admission, but you won't stay in the hostel. You are too naive. But he didn't listen to me.\"\nOn the night of 14 October, 2016, Mr Ahmed reportedly got into a scuffle with a group of students affiliated to ABVP who were campaigning for hostel elections. JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.\nIn his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. \nThe doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.\nAccording to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.\nA CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. \nMs Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. \nFor days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.\nIn November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.\nA month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. \nIn May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. \nA year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. \nThe agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.\nA one million rupees [$11,600; \u00a38,600] reward for information about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. \nThe case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. \nShe alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.\nThe agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.\n\nExplaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.\nThe judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.\n\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.\nThe court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.\nThe order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. \nColin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. \n\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. \nMs Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.\n\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked.  \n\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. \nHowever, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". \nMs Nafees says she's not done fighting. Every 15 October, the day her son vanished, she joins a candle march at JNU in his memory. The hope has dimmed, but the wait continues.\n\"Sometimes I wonder if I should put a nameplate outside our house,\" said Nafees Ahmed, his father. \n\"Our house has been renovated. What if he comes, but can't recognise it?\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "It took just a few days for Indian Instagram sensation Babydoll Archi to double her following to 1.4 million, thanks to a couple of viral social media moments.\nOne was a video that showed her in a red sari, dancing seductively to Dame Un Grr \u2013 a Romanian song. And a photo posted on the platform showed her posing with American adult film star Kendra Lust.\nSuddenly everyone wanted to know about her  - and the name Babydoll Archi trended in Google search and  spawned countless memes and fan pages. But there was one issue about to emerge \u2013 there was no real woman behind the online sensation.\nThe Instagram account was fake, although the face it used had uncanny likeness to a real woman - a homemaker in Dibrugarh city in Assam, whom we'll call Sanchi.\nThe truth unravelled after her brother lodged a police complaint. Pratim Bora, Sanchi's ex-boyfriend, was arrested. \nSenior police officer Sizal Agarwal who's heading the investigation told the BBC that Sanchi and Bora had a falling out and the AI likeness he created was to exact \"pure revenge\" on her.\nBora - a mechanical engineer and a self-taught artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast  - used private photos of Sanchi to create a fake profile, Ms Agarwal said.\nBora is in custody and has not made any statements yet. The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak.\nBabydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021. The initial photos were her real pictures that had been morphed, Ms Agarwal said.\n\"As time passed, Bora used tools such as ChatGPT and Dzine to create an AI version. He then populated the handle with deepfake photos and videos.\"\nThe account started picking up likes from last year but it started gaining traction from April this year, she added.\nSanchi is not on social media and she found out about the account only once the mainstream media began profiling Babydoll Archi, describing her as \"an influencer\". Reports speculated that she could be joining the US porn industry - possibly a first for someone from the north-eastern state of Assam. \nThe short two-paragraph complaint to the police submitted by Sanchi's family on the night of 11 July came with printouts of some photos and videos as evidence.\nMs Agarwal says it did not name anyone because they had no idea who could be behind it.\nBabydoll Archi was not an unfamiliar name for the police. Ms Agarwal says they had also seen media reports and comments speculating that she was AI generated, but there had been no suggestion that it was based on a real person.\nOnce they received the complaint, police wrote to Instagram asking for the details of the account's creator.\n\"Once we received information from Instagram, we asked Sanchi if she knew any Pratim Bora. Once she confirmed, we traced his address in the neighbouring district of Tinsukia. We arrested him on the evening of 12 July.\"\nMs Agarwal says the police have \"seized his laptop, mobile phones and hard drives and his bank documents since he had monetised the account\".\n\"The account had 3,000 subscriptions on linktree and we believe he had earned 1m rupees from it. We believe he made 300,000 rupees in just five days before his arrest,\" she added. \nMs Agarwal says Sanchi is \"extremely distraught - but now she and her family are receiving counselling and they are doing better\".\nThere really is no way to prevent something like this from happening, \"but had we acted earlier, we could have prevented it from gaining so much traction\", Ms Agarwal said.\n\"But Sanchi had no idea because she has no social media presence. Her family too had been blocked out from this account. They became aware only once it went viral,\" she added.\nMeta has not responded to the BBC queries on the case, but it generally does not allow posting of nudity or sexual content. And last month, CBS reported that it removed a number of ads promoting AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people. \n\nThe Instagram account of Babydoll Archi, which had 282 posts, is no longer available to public - although social media is replete with her photos and videos and one Instagram account seems to have all of them. The BBC has asked Meta what they are planning to do about it.\nMeghna Bal, AI expert and lawyer, says what happened to Sanchi \"is horrible but almost impossible to prevent\".\nShe can go to the court and seek the right to be forgotten, and a court can order the press reports that named her to be taken down but it's hard to scrub all the trace from the internet.\nWhat happened to Sanchi, she says, is what's always been happening to women, where their photos and videos are circulated as revenge.\n\"It's now a lot easier to do because of AI, but such incidents are still not as common as we expect - or they could be under-reported because of stigma or people being targeted may not even know about it as in the present case,\" Ms Bal says. And people watching it had no incentive to report it to the social media platform or cybercrime portal, she adds.\nIn their complaint against Mr Bora, police have invoked sections of law that deal with sexual harassment, distribution of obscene material, defamation, forgery to harm reputation, cheating by personification and cybercrime. If found guilty, Mr Bora could get up to 10 years in prison.\nThe case which has also led to outrage on social media in recent days has seen some seeking tougher laws to deal with such cases.\nMs Bal believes there are enough laws to take care of such cases, but whether there's scope for new laws to deal with generative AI companies has to be looked at.\n\"But we also have to remember that deepfakes are not necessarily bad and laws have to be carefully crafted because they can be weaponised to chill free speech.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Everyone wants their child to play cricket' - How WPL changed India's societal norms\nIndia's women have just won a T20 series on English soil for the first time. A 50-over World Cup on their home turf is imminent, which could take the sport to fever pitch in a country that already boasts the lucrative Women's Premier League, the second most valuable women's sports league in the world.\nFor former captain Mithali Raj, the opportunities and financial rewards available to the country's top female cricketers in 2025 are a world away from when she broke into the India team in 1999, aged 16.\n\"I was pretty much emptying my dad's pocket to play for India,\" she explains during a trip to England that saw her honoured by ringing the five-minute bell at Lord's during the third men's Test.\n\"There was absolutely no payment. We had to buy our own equipment and try to organise our own training sessions. There were times when we'd train on matting wickets, and then we'd get a week to practice on the turf [before a match].\"\nCultural and socio-economic challenges were also prevalent among many families, who did not want their daughters playing cricket, either because it was deemed a men's game or they needed their daughter to be working and earning money.\nRaj debuted for India seven years before the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took over the administration, following a merger with the Women's Cricket Association of India.\nShe witnessed the start of a slow transformation, as the women's game began to be better resourced with match fees introduced and access to top facilities, such as the National Cricket Academy with the best physios and trainers.\nIn order to earn a living, India's national players had to have jobs, most with Indian Railways, as they were \"the only institution that gave jobs to women cricketers in India\".\nThe next game-changing moment for Raj and her compatriots was the announcement of BCCI retainer contracts for the top 11 players in 2015. Raj was nearly 33.\n\"If you are from an affluent family, you can manage to play for however long, because you do not really have to think about how you are going to run your house,\" she says. \"But if you are not, you would think, what next? Where am I going to earn money?\n\"Contracts gave that safety for the national players. They know, 'OK, I can play and I can earn'. That was huge for us.\"\nThe rise of women's cricket in India with Mithali Raj\nSloppy England beaten by India in first ODI\nRaj identifies India's participation in the 2017 World Cup final against England at Lord's as a seminal moment.\nIt was only the third World Cup staged under the auspices of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the first time every match of a Women's World Cup was visible either via live streaming or on TV.\nThe ICC's digital and social media channels received a record 100 million video views.\n\"Until then, we really did not have that sort of coverage,\" says Raj. \"Digital media was relatively new in 2017. It really doubled up the sort of coverage that women's cricket needed.\"\nIndia lost to the hosts but it was a ground-breaking match. It was sold out, and according to India's Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) the final generated 19.53 million impressions in India, making it the most watched female sports event in the country, beating the badminton final at the Rio Olympics between PV Sindhu and Carolina Marin.\nAfter that final, the pay for contracted top-tier international players rose from a reported 15 lakh to 50 lakh.\nBy 2020, Star Sports were broadcasting India's matches at the Women's T20 World Cup in five different languages. India's defeat by Australia in the final was watched in India by a record live average audience of 9.02 million according to the ICC.\nAfter reaching, and losing, another final, this time in front of a record crowd of 86,174 at the MCG, the BCCI raised women's international match fees to be equal with men's in 2022.\nMumbai Indians won the 2025 WPL, after winning the inaugural edition in 2023\nThe women's cricket world had long been waiting for the women's version of the Indian Premier League (IPL). When it finally arrived in 2023 it exploded onto the scene with five teams bought for \u00a3465m and Viacom buying the media rights for \u00a396m over five years.\nSmriti Mandhana was the most expensive player, bought for a jaw-dropping \u00a3340,000 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\nThe competition turned a profit and contributed around 3.9%, external of the BCCI's revenue in the 2023-24 financial year. That is over-shadowed by the IPL's contribution of 59.10%, but it is vindication of the BCCI waiting until the market was right.\nThe WPL offers potentially life-changing sums for up to 90 players (up to 30 of which could be overseas). Outside of the WPL however, there are no contracts for domestic cricketers in India, only match fees.\nOne BCCI official has said players who don't have a WPL deal \"fend for themselves\". If they are lucky, they may have a personal sponsor, mentor or advocate who supports them financially. Some players may have jobs in the same way that Raj was employed by Railways.\nThis is the same structure that exists in the men's domestic game across India, with no contracts at state level.\nThe number of women's retainers has increased marginally, with 16 women awarded in 2024-25. These contracts require annual renewal, and don't offer maternity clauses. There are 34 BCCI retainers available to men.\nIn a country of 1.4 billion, where the BCCI's Under-15s girls' competition alone sees 36 teams and potentially 540 players competing (numbers replicated at U19 and U23 level), WPL pay packets reach the few rather than the many. But the money to be chased has changed attitudes around girls' cricket.\n\"Now it is not looked down upon,\" says a smiling Raj. \"Cricket is a profession, it's a sport, and everybody is keen to get their girls to play cricket. That's a huge, huge shift.\"\nThe crowds and media attention on the WPL has helped to accustom domestic players to big-stage cricket before they play for the national side.\nThe tournament also helps enormously with talent scouting.\n\"India is a very big country, so the selectors cannot go to every state and identify players,\" says Raj. \"The franchises have scouts they send to every part of the country. They pick players who are raw, who have been not seen before, and they get an opportunity.\"\nA clear pathway exists to the women's national team, through club, district, state, zone, India A then India. However, barriers still remain.\n\"There is a lot of raw talent in the districts and in the villages,\" says Raj. \"It's just that they don't have the facilities if a young girl in the interiors wants to start playing cricket.\n\"The society in the villages - it still needs to progress. And the financial barrier is huge. I'm associated with Andhra Cricket Association and I went into these districts and there were a few girls who did not have money for three meals in a day. The associations have to make an effort to get into these places and give them basic facilities.\n\"But otherwise, to play cricket in India now, it's far more open and easier than before.\nShe concludes: \"The next step is to add a couple more teams to WPL, because there are many good players who get left out with just five teams.\n\"And of course winning the World Cup.\"\nHowever, as Raj sees it, the prize that would propel the Indian game forward exponentially would be Olympic gold, with cricket in LA 2028.\n\"It's a chance to get a medal for the country.

announced in May after years of negotiations - will boost the British economy by \u00a34.8bn a year. \nThe agreement was approved by the Indian cabinet earlier this week but has not yet been agreed by the UK parliament and is expected to take at least a year to come into effect.\nThe agreement includes lower tariffs on:\nThe government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India.\nUK exports that will see levies fall include:\nThe UK already imports \u00a311bn in goods from India but the lower tariffs agreed will make Indian exports cheaper, including for components used in advanced manufacturing.\nIndian manufacturers are also expected to gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles.\nAverage tariffs for UK exports to India will drop from 15% to 3%, making it easier for British companies to sell goods in India.\nWhisky tariffs for exports to India have been slashed in half, from 150% to 75%, giving the UK an immediate advantage over international competitors in reaching the Indian market, and the tariff will drop to 40% by 2035.\nThe two prime ministers also agreed on closer collaboration around defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. \nEnhanced intelligence sharing and operational collaboration will also assist in tackling corruption, serious fraud, organised crime, and irregular migration.\nThis includes finalising a new sharing agreement for criminal records, which will assist court proceedings, help maintain accurate watchlists, and enable the enforcement of travel bans. \nThe deal has not given the UK as much access as it would have liked to India's financial and legal services industries, and talks continue on a bilateral investment treaty aimed at protecting British investments in India and vice versa.\nThe two nations also continue to discuss UK plans for a tax on high-carbon industries, which India believes could hit its imports unfairly.\nThe Indian government welcomed an extended exemption on national insurance contributions, calling this \"an unprecedented achievement\" when the deal was agreed in May.\nThe agreement means staff from Indian companies who are temporarily transferred to the UK, and staff from UK firms who are temporarily working in India, will only pay social security contributions in their home country, rather than in both places.\nHowever, the UK government stressed it already has similar reciprocal \"double contribution convention\" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea.\nResponding to suggestions the deal meant British workers could be undercut by cheaper Indian workers, Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: \"I can categorically tell you that is not the case.\n\"There is no tax advantage for hiring an Indian worker over a British worker.\"\nConservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith claimed the trade deal had only been made possible \"because of Brexit delivered by the Conservatives\" and was  \"a step in the right direction\".\nBut he added: \"The irony should not be lost on anyone that any gains from this trade deal will be blown out of the water by [Deputy Prime Minister] Angela Rayner's union charter, stifling business with red tape, the jobs tax and, come autumn, Rachel Reeves' inevitable tax hikes that will punish Britain's makers just to reward those who do not contribute.\"\nHowever, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said Brexit was what had hindered UK jobs and growth and called for a new UK-EU customs union.\n\"We support the opening of trade, which is vital in the face of the tariff wars launched by Donald Trump,\" he said. \n\"But the gains from this deal are a small fraction of what the government could deliver for jobs and growth from a better deal with the EU.\"\n",

        "article_text": "French fries turned around the fortunes of Jitesh Patel.\nHe comes from a family of farmers in Gujarat in the northwest of India. Traditionally they grew cotton, but the returns were poor. \nDroughts in 2001 and 2002 made the situation worse and the Patels knew things had to change. \n\"We realised that we had to start growing something that does not require lot of water,\" Mr Patel says.\nSo, they experimented with potatoes. Initially they tried table potatoes; the kind available in local markets and cooked at home, but the returns weren't much better than cotton.\nSpurred by the arrival of french fry makers in their state, in 2007 they started growing the varieties of potato used by the food industry. It turned out to be a winning strategy.\n\"Since then, no looking back,\" says Mr Patel.\nMr Patel is part of India's rise to potato superpower status. It is already the world's second biggest spud producer.\nBut it's the export market, particularly of french fries, that's really flying. \nGujarat has become India's capital of french fry production, home to huge factories churning out chips, including facilities belonging to Canadian giant McCain Foods and India's biggest maker of French Fries, HyFun Foods.\nFrom Gujarat fries are sent all over over the world. But the most important markets at the moment are in Asia, including the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, according to Devendra K, who has been studying the potato market for many years. \nIn February of this year, monthly exports of Indian frozen fries broke the 20,000 tonnes barrier for the first time. In the year to February, India's fry exports totalled 181,773 tonnes, a 45% increase compared with the previous year.\nThe success is partly down to price.\n\"Indian frozen fries are noted for being competitively priced in the international market,\" says Devendra. \nHe says that in 2024, the average price of Indian fries was even cheaper than those from China. \nFor the french fry makers, it's boom time.\n\"India has emerged as a significant player and exporter due to its abundant agricultural produce, cost-effective manufacturing, and growing focus on quality standards,\" says Haresh Karamchandani, CEO of HyFun Foods.\nHyFun has seven plants processing potatoes in Gujarat with another two coming online by 2026.\n\"Urbanisation, increasing disposable incomes and changing lifestyles have promoted the consumption of frozen foods, not only in the household but also in food service establishments,\" says Mr Karamchandani.\nMeeting that demand has required decades of innovation from farmers.\nJitesh Patel studied agriculture at university and has been applying science to farming ever since. \nAlong with friends and family they are continuously trying to improve their potato yield.\n\"We are a well educated bunch of farmers, so we keep trying new methods,\" he says.\nOne of their first innovations, back in 2003, was to switch to a drip system of irrigation, rather than flooding fields with water.\nTo keep the soil productive the fields are rested over the summer, and fertilised with cow manure.\nTheir focus now is finding the perfect potato plant.\n\"We are in the process of experimenting with seeds and soon we will have a new variety,\" he says. \nJain Irrigation Systems is a large agricultural technology company. As well as selling irrigation equipment, it has teams of technicians developing seeds for agriculture, including potato plants.\nThey use a set of techniques known as tissue culture. It's a way of cloning plants, with desirable traits and eliminating disease. \nIt involves growing small pieces of plant tissue in a controlled laboratory environment to create virus-free plantlets. These plantlets can then be used to produce more seed potatoes through methods like taking cuttings.\n\"Potato seeds destined for future seed production undergo meticulous breeding practices under the supervision of breeders,\" says Vijay Singh, vice president of marketing at the company.\nOne issue they are tackling at the moment concerns a variety of potatoes used to make chips. Farmers found that by November the potato crop starts to go brown because of its sugar content. \n\"Companies like us who are into tissue culture are trying to come up with a new variety to overcome the challenges that the industry is facing,\" says Mr Singh.\nWhile Indian farmers are working on improving their yields, investment is needed elsewhere in the frozen food industry.\nIn particular, firms need to be able to store and transport goods at sub-zero temperatures.\nModern cold storage facilities have been built, but more are needed.\n\"Only about 10\u201315% of India's cold storage facilities are suitable for storing frozen foods,\" says Vijay Kumar Nayak, co-founder of Indo Agri Foods, an exporter of  Indian food. \n\"These facilities are unevenly distributed, heavily concentrated in a few states, leaving rural and remote regions severely underserved.\nTransportation is a problem as well. \n\"There is a notable shortage of specialised refrigerated trucks and containers, making temperature-controlled transportation extremely difficult and increasing the risk of spoilage,\" he says. \nA reliable electricity supply is also essential.\n\"Frequent power outages in many parts of the country increase the chances of spoilage and make running a reliable frozen food supply chain a daunting task,\" says Mr Nayak.\n\"Indian companies face intense competition in export markets from countries like China, Thailand and Brazil. These nations benefit from more advanced logistics, infrastructure, and production systems,\" he points out.\nBack at his Gujarat farm Mr Patel is happy that the chip makers moved in. \n\"Gujarat has become a food processing hub. Most of the farmers, including me, have become contract farmers which gives us security and good money for our yield,\" he says.",

That includes soft drinks, down from a 33% tariff - an Irn Bru, sahib?\nBut it's a very significant boost to the prospects of selling more branded Scotch and pushing into premium markets for single malts.\nWhat has made the difference that got this deal done?\nOne key to this has been Diageo. With around 40% of Scotch production, it has the brands and the marketing heft that already reach into India's middle class.\nIt has also been crucial to weakening the resistance to tariffs of India's domestic distillers, by becoming the largest of them.\nIt bought the United Distillers empire inherited and expanded by Vijay Mallya, the flamboyant businessman who paid big for Scotch distiller Whyte & Mackay.\nAs his empire collapsed and he hit big legal problems (still unresolved), Diageo took control in 2015, but had to offload Whyte & Mackay to avoid the attention of the competition regulator.\nThus, the company that is the main domestic distiller became the same company that is the biggest winner if tariffs come down.\nOf course, a trade deal is a lot more complex than alcoholic spirits. And they have been less of a concern for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He comes from Gujarat, a state that has long banned consumption or sale of alcohol, with a few exceptions recently put in place.\nHe may reckon on continued Indian obstacles from non-tariff barriers, including labelling, customs delays, retail restrictions, and India's sclerotic legal system, but the trade deal has tried to secure gains on these.\nOne of Mr Modi's personal interests is in the global export of yoga \u2013 the Hindu version rather than its western interpretations.\nAnd among the categories of workers given special measures in the trade deal are yoga teachers, as well as chefs.\nIndia has other, more significant asks of the UK, which have also been a reason for previous British ministers to stall a deal.\nForemost among them has been access for its companies to place Indians into the British labour market. Companies such as Wipro and Tata Consulting Services have vast numbers of IT specialists they can place with clients, but Britain has resisted allowing more in.\nIndian companies have invested in UK subsidiaries and bought British companies, such as Jaguar Land Rover. They also want to be able to place their own people from India in British factories and offices, at least temporarily.\nThe trade deal allows for a smoother process, and more predictable \"locked-in\" work visa rules, for longer periods than they've been able to secure before.\nThe UK government's description of that deal is defensive, emphasising what it will not do \u2013 it won't increase immigration figures, and it will not mean that these migrant workers will have the right to remain in Britain permanently.\nOther parts of the trade deal extend to car trade in both directions, where India's reputation for car manufacturing has greatly improved under Japanese and Korean influence.\nFood and clothing imports with low, or no, tariffs are expected to drive down some costs for British consumers.\nThe total value of this is calculated by the UK government at \u00a36bn of additional investment in the UK, as a stimulus to create 2200 British jobs over its initial 15 years and to add \u00a34.5bn to total output, including a \u00a3190m gain to the Scottish economy.\nThe economic modelling suggests exports from the UK rising by more than \u00a315bn over the projections for trade growth without a deal. In recent years, they've been worth around \u00a311bn.\nThat's a big number, but not huge in terms of economic growth more widely. Its significance lies in being the biggest and most significant deal struck by the UK government since Brexit, when Westminster regained the power to strike deals on trade.\nIt sends a signal. India and the UK are open for business, and touting the gains from freer trade, rather than wanting to put up new barriers. The contrast is clear with the American president, arriving in Britain as Narendra Modi departs.\nThe Scotch whisky industry is very pleased by the India deal, but remains very concerned about the prospect of further barriers to sales in the USA. There is already a 10% tariff.\nThat could have a 25% added to it in July next year, with the end of the suspension of a tariff on single malt whisky, including the more valuable brands.\nThat was introduced as collateral penalty in the dispute over state subsidies for Boeing in the US and Airbus in the EU, with a reciprocal tariff on bourbon heading east, and it was then suspended while Joe Biden was president.\nIt does not require Donald Trump to impose that tariff once more. Unless he chooses to change it, it will automatically return next American Independence Day, 4 July.\nAhead of Sir Keir Starmer's meeting with the US President somewhere in the Aberdeen area, whisky industry source says \"he must not be allowed to leave Scotland without an agreement to avoid that happening\".",

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture.

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "\"Let me tell you a secret. Your nana (grandfather) helped Jewish families escape the Nazis.\"\nThat single sentence from his mother set Vinay Gupta off on a journey into his grandfather's past. What he unearthed was a tale more gripping than fiction: a little-known act of heroism by an Indian businessman who risked everything to save strangers in Europe's darkest hour.\nThis wasn't just compassion; it was logistics, risk, and resolve. Back in India, Kundanlal set up a businesses to employ Jews, built homes to house them - only to watch the British declare them as \"enemy aliens\" and detain them once World War Two broke out.\nKundanlal's life reads like an epic: a poor boy from Ludhiana, married at 13, who sold everything from timber and salt to lab gear and bullock-cart wheels. He also ran a clothing business and a matchstick factory. He topped his class in Lahore - joining the colonial civil service at 22, only to resign from it all to participate in the freedom movement and a life of building factories.\nHe shook hands with Indian independence leader and later its first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and crossed paths with actress Devika Rani on a steamer to Europe.\nIn A Rescue In Vienna, a family memoir, Gupta uncovers his grandfather's  extraordinary Indian rescue on foreign soil - pieced together through family letters, survivor interviews, and historical records.\nIn the shadow of Hitler's 1938 annexation of Austria, Kundanlal, a machine tool manufacturer from Ludhiana city in the northern state of Punjab, quietly offered Jewish professionals jobs in India to get them life-saving visas. He offered work,  provided livelihood and build homes for those families in India. \nKundanlal rescued five families.\nFritz Weiss, a 30-year-old Jewish lawyer, was hiding in a hospital, feigning illness. Kundanlal was also in the same hospital to get treatment for an illness. \nAfter Nazis forced Weiss to clean the streets outside his own home, Kundanlal handed him a lifeline: a job offer at the fictitious \"Kundan Agencies.\" It got him a visa to India.\nAlfred Wachsler, a master woodworker, met Kundanlal while bringing his pregnant wife for tests. Promised a future in furniture and a sponsor for emigration, his family became one of the Jewish households to reach India between January 1938 and February 1939. \nHans Losch, a textile technician, answered Kundanlal's advert in an Austrian paper for skilled workers. Offered a managerial role at the imaginary \"Kundan Cloth Mills\" in Ludhiana - with housing, profit share, and safe passage - he seized the chance to start over.\nAlfred Schafranek, once owner of a 50-employee plywood factory, pitched his skills to Kundanlal and was offered a role in building India's most modern plywood unit. His entire family, including his mechanic brother Siegfried, was rescued.\nAnd Siegmund Retter, a machine tools businessman, was among the first Kundanlal approached. As his business collapsed under Nazi rule, Kundanlal began arranging his move to India to start again.\nIt all began with a hospital bed in Vienna. \nStruggling with diabetes and hemorrhoids, Kundanlal, then 45, sought new treatments and read about a specialist in Vienna. In 1938, while recovering from surgery there, he met Lucy and Alfred Wachsler, a young couple expecting their first child. From them, he learned of rising antisemitic violence and the destruction of Jewish lives. \nOver the next few months, he met other men. Encouraged by this success, Kundanlal placed newspaper adverts seeking skilled workers willing to relocate to India. Among the respondents were Wachsler, Losch, Schafranek and Retter. Kundanlal offered each a job, financial guarantees, and support to secure Indian visas.\n\"A striking aspect of all of Kundanlal's elaborate scheming on behalf of these families was how close mouthed he remained, keeping up appearances of technology transfer to India until the very end,\" Gupta writes. \n\"He did not share his intent or plans with any Indian or British officials. His family learned of his plans only when he returned home months later.\" \nIn October 1938, Losch became the first of Kundanlal's recruits to arrive in Ludhiana. \nHe was welcomed into Kundanlal's home - but found little comfort in the quiet town, writes Gupta. With no Jewish community, no cultural life, and a struggling cloth mill, Losch left within weeks for Bombay (now Mumbai), citing poor working conditions and little chance of profit. He never returned.\nWeiss lasted even less - just under two months. The company created for him, Kundan Agencies, never took off. He soon moved to Bombay, found work in flooring, and by 1947 had relocated to England. \nDespite their departures, Kundanlal bore no resentment, writes Gupta.\n\"My aunt told me that on the contrary, Kundanlal had been embarrassed that he could not provide a lifestyle and social environment more suited to Vienna, and felt that if he had, the two men may have stayed on in Ludhiana.\" \nNot all stories ended this way.\nAlfred and Lucy Wachsler, with their infant son, arrived by sea, rail, and road - finally stepping off the train at Ludhiana. \nThey moved into a spacious home Kundanlal built for them next door to another, prepared for the Schafraneks. Alfred quickly set up a furniture workshop, using Burmese teak and local Sikh labour to craft elegant dining sets - one of which still survives in the author's family.\nIn March 1939, Alfred Schafranek, his brother Siegfried, and their families arrived from Austria. They launched one of India's earliest plywood factories in a shed behind the two homes. \nDriven and exacting, Alfred pushed untrained workers hard, determined to build something lasting. Gupta writes, the work was intense, the Punjab heat unfamiliar, and the isolation palpable - especially for the women, confined mostly to domestic life.\nAs the months passed in Ludhiana, the initial relief gave way to boredom. \nThe men worked long hours, while the women, limited by language and isolation, kept to household routines. \nIn September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. Days later, Britain declared war on Germany - the British parliament pulled India into the conflict. Over 2.5 million Indians would serve in the war, 87,000 never returned.\nIn Ludhiana, the reality of war hit fast. \nBy 1940, new policies ordered all German nationals - Jewish or not - into internment camps. \nThe Wachsler and Schafranek families were forcibly relocated to the Purandhar Internment Camp near Poona (now Pune), housed in bare barracks with kerosene lamps and minimal comforts. They had committed no crime - only carried the wrong passport.\nEventually, release became possible - if they could find paid work. \nAlfred and Siegfried Schafranek secured roles managing a new plywood business in Bangalore and moved there with their families, starting all over again. The Wachsler family left the camp in 1942 after Alfred found a job in Karachi. The two families never met again.\nPurandhar Camp closed in 1946, nearly a year after the war ended. \nIn 1948, Alfred Wachsler's cousin sponsored US refugee visas for the family. That October, they flew out of Karachi, never to return to India. The Schafraneks relocated to Australia in 1947 after a successful plywood venture in Bangalore.\nWhile researching the book, Gupta met Alex Wachsler - whose father, Alfred, had also built the Burmese teak desk Kundanlal once used in his tiny 120 sq ft office. (Alfred died in 1973.)\n\"Despite living in US since the age of 10, and now into his eighties, Alex Wachsler still pines for his life in India, eats at Indian restaurants, delights in meeting Indians and surprises them with his knowledge of Urdu,\" writes Gupta.\nBack in Ludhiana, Kundanlal opened a school for his daughters at home, soon expanding it into one of Punjab's oldest schools - still running today with 900 students. His wife, Saraswati, grew increasingly withdrawn and battled depression.\nKundanlal and Saraswati had five children, including four daughters. In 1965, Saraswati died after a tragic fall from their terrace. She spent her final years in silence, emotionally distanced from the family. Kundanlal passed away a year later, aged 73, from a heart attack. \n\"The notion of a 'passive bystander' was anathema to Kundanlal. If he saw something, or someone, that required attention, he attended to it, never intimidated by the enormity of the problem,\" writes Gupta.\nA fitting epitaph for a man whose legacy was not just business, but quiet defiance, compassion, and conviction.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

It is expected to splash down in just under 24 hours. \nLed by former Nasa veteran Peggy Whitson and piloted by Group Captain Shukla, Ax-4 had arrived at ISS on 26 June. Its crew included Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to have gone to space. His trip came 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma flew aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - is a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. \nOn Monday, ISS posted on X that the Ax-4 crew had taken their places in the spacecraft and its hatches had been closed. The undocking of the craft - when it separated from the ISS - was broadcast live. \nAxiom Space said the craft would splash down in the ocean off the coast of California and a vessel would then pick it up.\nIndian Science Minister Jitendra Singh has said the splash down is scheduled for 15 July at approximately 15:00 India time (09:30 GMT).\nIn his farewell address from aboard the ISS on Sunday, the Indian astronaut said India's journey in space exploration may be tough, but it has begun.\n\"It has been an incredible journey. Even though now it is coming to an end, for you and me there is a long way to go. The journey of our human space mission is very long and difficult. But if we are determined, even the stars are attainable.\"\nHe referred to India's first man in space cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma famously quoting from a 1924 Urdu song \"Sare jahan se achcha\" to say \"India looked better than the rest of the world\".\n\"Even today we want to know how it looks from space. I'll tell you. From space, today's India looks ambitious. It looks fearless. It looks confident. It looks proud. And so, I can once again say that today's India still looks better than the rest of the world,\" Group Captain Shukla said. \nAx-4, which was originally expected to spend two weeks on the ISS, ended up staying a few days longer. During their stay, Axiom Space said the crew conducted 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nIsro, which had paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla on Ax-4 and his training, has said the hands-on experience he gains during his trip to the ISS will help India in its human space flights.\nIsro has announced plans to launch Gaganyaan - the country's first-ever human space flight in 2027 - and has ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nGroup Captain Shukla is among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on Gaganyaan.\nBorn on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.\nHe has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks and has more than 2,000 hours of flying experience.\nBefore flying into space, Group Captain Shukla described the past year as \"nothing short of transformative\".\n\"It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts. I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,\" he had said. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Long before India gained independence, one defiant voice inside the British Empire dared to call out a colonial massacre - and paid a price for it.\nSir Chettur Sankaran Nair, a lawyer, was one of the few Indians to be appointed to top government posts when the British ruled the country.   \nIn 1919, he resigned from the Viceroy's Council after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the northern Indian city of Amritsar in Punjab, in which hundreds of civilians attending a public meeting were shot dead by British troops. On the 100th anniversary of the massacre, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May described the tragedy as a \"shameful scar\" on Britain's history in India.\nNair's criticism of Punjab's then Lieutenant Governor, Michael O'Dwyer, led to a libel case against him, which helped spotlight the massacre and the actions of British officials.\nIn a biography of Nair, KPS Menon, independent India's first foreign secretary, described him as \"a very controversial figure of his time\". \nNair was known for his independent views and distaste for extremist politics, and spoke critically of colonial rule and even of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian independence hero who is now regarded as the father of the nation. \nMenon, who married Nair's daughter Saraswathy, wrote: \"Only [Nair] could have insulted the all powerful British Viceroy on his face and opposed Mahatma Gandhi openly.\"\nNair was not a familiar name in India in recent decades, but earlier this year, a Bollywood film based on the court case, Kesari Chapter 2- starring superstar Akshay Kumar - helped bring attention to his life.\nNair was born in 1857 into a wealthy family in what is now Palakkad district in Kerala state. He studied at the Presidency College in Madras, acquiring a bachelor's degree before studying law and beginning his career as an apprentice with a Madras High Court judge.\nIn 1887, he joined the social reform movement in the Madras presidency. Throughout his career, he fought to reform Hindu laws of the time on marriage and women's rights and to abolish the caste system.\nFor some years, he was a delegate to the Indian National Congress and presided over its 1897 session in Amraoti (Amravati). In his address, he held the British-run government \"morally responsible for the extreme poverty of the masses\", saying the annual famines \"claimed more victims and created more distress than under any civilised government anywhere else in the world\". \nHe was appointed public prosecutor in 1899 and writes in his autobiography about advising the government on seditious articles in newspapers, including those by his close friend G Subramania Iyer, the first editor of The Hindu newspaper. \"On many occasions\u2026 I was able to persuade them not to take any step against him.\"\nHe became a high court judge in 1908 and was knighted four years later.\nNair moved to Delhi in 1915 when he was appointed a member of the Viceroy's Council, only the third Indian to hold the position. \nHe was a fierce proponent of India's right to govern itself and pushed for constitutional reforms during his time on the council. Through 1918 and 1919, his dissent and negotiations with Edwin Montagu, then secretary of state for India, helped expand provisions of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms which laid out how India would gradually achieve self-governance.\nMontagu wrote in his diary that he had been warned \"that it was absolutely necessary to get him on my side, for Sankaran Nair wielded more influence than any other Indian\".\nA pivotal moment in Nair's career as a statesman was the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh, when hundreds of unarmed Indians were shot dead in a public garden on the day of the Baisakhi festival. Official estimates said nearly 400 people were killed and more than 1,500 wounded by the soldiers, who fired under the orders of Brigadier General REH Dyer. Indian sources put the death toll closer to 1,000.\nNair writes in his 1922 book Gandhi and Anarchy about following the events in Punjab with increasing concern. The shooting at Jallianwala Bagh was part of a larger crackdown in the province, where martial law had been introduced - the region was cut off from the rest of the country and no newspapers were allowed into it.\n\"If to govern the country, it is necessary that innocent persons should be slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh and that any Civilian Officer may, at any time, call in the military and the two together may butcher the people as at Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in,\" he wrote.\nA month later, he resigned from the council and left for Britain, where he hoped to rouse public opinion on the massacre.\nIn his memoir, Nair writes of speaking to the editor of The Westminster Gazette which soon published an article called the Amritsar Massacre. Other papers including The Times also followed suit.\n\"Worse things had happened under British rule, but I am glad I was able to obtain publicity for this one at least,\" Nair wrote.\nNair's book Gandhi and Anarchy drew the ire of several Indian nationalists of the time after he criticised Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, calling it a \"weapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our purpose\".\nBut it was the few passages condemning Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, that became the basis for the libel suit against him in 1924. \nNair accused O'Dwyer of terrorism, holding him responsible for the atrocities committed by the civil government before the imposition of martial law. \nA five-week trial in the Court of King's Bench in London ruled 11:1 in favour of O'Dwyer, awarding damages of \u00a3500 and \u00a37,000 in costs to him.\nO'Dwyer offered to forgo this for an apology but Nair refused and paid instead.\nReports of the depositions in the hearing were published daily in The Times. Nair's family says despite losing, the case achieved his purpose of having the atrocities brought to public attention. \nNair's great-grandson Raghu Palat, who co-wrote the book The Case That Shook the Empire, with his wife Pushpa, says the case helped spark \"an uproar for the freedom movement\".\nIt also showed that \"there was no point in having a dominion status under the empire when the British cannot be expected to deal with their subjects fairly\", adds Pushpa.\nEven Gandhi referred to the case several times, writing once that Nair had showed pluck in fighting without hope of victory, historian PC Roy Chaudhury later pointed out.\nAfter losing the case, Nair continued with his career in India. He was chairman of the Indian Committee of the Simon Commission, which reviewed the working of constitutional reforms in India in 1928.\nHe died in 1934 at the age of 77.\nThrough his career, Menon notes, Nair \"bent all his thoughts and energies on the emancipation of his country from the bondage of foreign domination and native custom. In this task, he achieved as much success as any man, wedded to constitutional methods\".",

The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak.\nBabydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021. The initial photos were her real pictures that had been morphed, Ms Agarwal said.\n\"As time passed, Bora used tools such as ChatGPT and Dzine to create an AI version. He then populated the handle with deepfake photos and videos.\"\nThe account started picking up likes from last year but it started gaining traction from April this year, she added.\nSanchi is not on social media and she found out about the account only once the mainstream media began profiling Babydoll Archi, describing her as \"an influencer\". Reports speculated that she could be joining the US porn industry - possibly a first for someone from the north-eastern state of Assam. \nThe short two-paragraph complaint to the police submitted by Sanchi's family on the night of 11 July came with printouts of some photos and videos as evidence.\nMs Agarwal says it did not name anyone because they had no idea who could be behind it.\nBabydoll Archi was not an unfamiliar name for the police. Ms Agarwal says they had also seen media reports and comments speculating that she was AI generated, but there had been no suggestion that it was based on a real person.\nOnce they received the complaint, police wrote to Instagram asking for the details of the account's creator.\n\"Once we received information from Instagram, we asked Sanchi if she knew any Pratim Bora. Once she confirmed, we traced his address in the neighbouring district of Tinsukia. We arrested him on the evening of 12 July.\"\nMs Agarwal says the police have \"seized his laptop, mobile phones and hard drives and his bank documents since he had monetised the account\".\n\"The account had 3,000 subscriptions on linktree and we believe he had earned 1m rupees from it. We believe he made 300,000 rupees in just five days before his arrest,\" she added. \nMs Agarwal says Sanchi is \"extremely distraught - but now she and her family are receiving counselling and they are doing better\".\nThere really is no way to prevent something like this from happening, \"but had we acted earlier, we could have prevented it from gaining so much traction\", Ms Agarwal said.\n\"But Sanchi had no idea because she has no social media presence. Her family too had been blocked out from this account. They became aware only once it went viral,\" she added.\nMeta has not responded to the BBC queries on the case, but it generally does not allow posting of nudity or sexual content. And last month, CBS reported that it removed a number of ads promoting AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people. \n\nThe Instagram account of Babydoll Archi, which had 282 posts, is no longer available to public - although social media is replete with her photos and videos and one Instagram account seems to have all of them. The BBC has asked Meta what they are planning to do about it.\nMeghna Bal, AI expert and lawyer, says what happened to Sanchi \"is horrible but almost impossible to prevent\".\nShe can go to the court and seek the right to be forgotten, and a court can order the press reports that named her to be taken down but it's hard to scrub all the trace from the internet.\nWhat happened to Sanchi, she says, is what's always been happening to women, where their photos and videos are circulated as revenge.\n\"It's now a lot easier to do because of AI, but such incidents are still not as common as we expect - or they could be under-reported because of stigma or people being targeted may not even know about it as in the present case,\" Ms Bal says. And people watching it had no incentive to report it to the social media platform or cybercrime portal, she adds.\nIn their complaint against Mr Bora, police have invoked sections of law that deal with sexual harassment, distribution of obscene material, defamation, forgery to harm reputation, cheating by personification and cybercrime. If found guilty, Mr Bora could get up to 10 years in prison.\nThe case which has also led to outrage on social media in recent days has seen some seeking tougher laws to deal with such cases.\nMs Bal believes there are enough laws to take care of such cases, but whether there's scope for new laws to deal with generative AI companies has to be looked at.\n\"But we also have to remember that deepfakes are not necessarily bad and laws have to be carefully crafted because they can be weaponised to chill free speech.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Everyone wants their child to play cricket' - How WPL changed India's societal norms\nIndia's women have just won a T20 series on English soil for the first time. A 50-over World Cup on their home turf is imminent, which could take the sport to fever pitch in a country that already boasts the lucrative Women's Premier League, the second most valuable women's sports league in the world.\nFor former captain Mithali Raj, the opportunities and financial rewards available to the country's top female cricketers in 2025 are a world away from when she broke into the India team in 1999, aged 16.\n\"I was pretty much emptying my dad's pocket to play for India,\" she explains during a trip to England that saw her honoured by ringing the five-minute bell at Lord's during the third men's Test.\n\"There was absolutely no payment. We had to buy our own equipment and try to organise our own training sessions. There were times when we'd train on matting wickets, and then we'd get a week to practice on the turf [before a match].\"\nCultural and socio-economic challenges were also prevalent among many families, who did not want their daughters playing cricket, either because it was deemed a men's game or they needed their daughter to be working and earning money.\nRaj debuted for India seven years before the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) took over the administration, following a merger with the Women's Cricket Association of India.\nShe witnessed the start of a slow transformation, as the women's game began to be better resourced with match fees introduced and access to top facilities, such as the National Cricket Academy with the best physios and trainers.\nIn order to earn a living, India's national players had to have jobs, most with Indian Railways, as they were \"the only institution that gave jobs to women cricketers in India\".\nThe next game-changing moment for Raj and her compatriots was the announcement of BCCI retainer contracts for the top 11 players in 2015. Raj was nearly 33.\n\"If you are from an affluent family, you can manage to play for however long, because you do not really have to think about how you are going to run your house,\" she says. \"But if you are not, you would think, what next? Where am I going to earn money?\n\"Contracts gave that safety for the national players. They know, 'OK, I can play and I can earn'. That was huge for us.\"\nThe rise of women's cricket in India with Mithali Raj\nSloppy England beaten by India in first ODI\nRaj identifies India's participation in the 2017 World Cup final against England at Lord's as a seminal moment.\nIt was only the third World Cup staged under the auspices of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the first time every match of a Women's World Cup was visible either via live streaming or on TV.\nThe ICC's digital and social media channels received a record 100 million video views.\n\"Until then, we really did not have that sort of coverage,\" says Raj. \"Digital media was relatively new in 2017. It really doubled up the sort of coverage that women's cricket needed.\"\nIndia lost to the hosts but it was a ground-breaking match. It was sold out, and according to India's Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) the final generated 19.53 million impressions in India, making it the most watched female sports event in the country, beating the badminton final at the Rio Olympics between PV Sindhu and Carolina Marin.\nAfter that final, the pay for contracted top-tier international players rose from a reported 15 lakh to 50 lakh.\nBy 2020, Star Sports were broadcasting India's matches at the Women's T20 World Cup in five different languages. India's defeat by Australia in the final was watched in India by a record live average audience of 9.02 million according to the ICC.\nAfter reaching, and losing, another final, this time in front of a record crowd of 86,174 at the MCG, the BCCI raised women's international match fees to be equal with men's in 2022.\nMumbai Indians won the 2025 WPL, after winning the inaugural edition in 2023\nThe women's cricket world had long been waiting for the women's version of the Indian Premier League (IPL). When it finally arrived in 2023 it exploded onto the scene with five teams bought for \u00a3465m and Viacom buying the media rights for \u00a396m over five years.\nSmriti Mandhana was the most expensive player, bought for a jaw-dropping \u00a3340,000 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.\nThe competition turned a profit and contributed around 3.9%, external of the BCCI's revenue in the 2023-24 financial year. That is over-shadowed by the IPL's contribution of 59.10%, but it is vindication of the BCCI waiting until the market was right.\nThe WPL offers potentially life-changing sums for up to 90 players (up to 30 of which could be overseas). Outside of the WPL however, there are no contracts for domestic cricketers in India, only match fees.\nOne BCCI official has said players who don't have a WPL deal \"fend for themselves\". If they are lucky, they may have a personal sponsor, mentor or advocate who supports them financially. Some players may have jobs in the same way that Raj was employed by Railways.\nThis is the same structure that exists in the men's domestic game across India, with no contracts at state level.\nThe number of women's retainers has increased marginally, with 16 women awarded in 2024-25. These contracts require annual renewal, and don't offer maternity clauses. There are 34 BCCI retainers available to men.\nIn a country of 1.4 billion, where the BCCI's Under-15s girls' competition alone sees 36 teams and potentially 540 players competing (numbers replicated at U19 and U23 level), WPL pay packets reach the few rather than the many. But the money to be chased has changed attitudes around girls' cricket.\n\"Now it is not looked down upon,\" says a smiling Raj. \"Cricket is a profession, it's a sport, and everybody is keen to get their girls to play cricket. That's a huge, huge shift.\"\nThe crowds and media attention on the WPL has helped to accustom domestic players to big-stage cricket before they play for the national side.\nThe tournament also helps enormously with talent scouting.\n\"India is a very big country, so the selectors cannot go to every state and identify players,\" says Raj. \"The franchises have scouts they send to every part of the country. They pick players who are raw, who have been not seen before, and they get an opportunity.\"\nA clear pathway exists to the women's national team, through club, district, state, zone, India A then India. However, barriers still remain.\n\"There is a lot of raw talent in the districts and in the villages,\" says Raj. \"It's just that they don't have the facilities if a young girl in the interiors wants to start playing cricket.\n\"The society in the villages - it still needs to progress. And the financial barrier is huge. I'm associated with Andhra Cricket Association and I went into these districts and there were a few girls who did not have money for three meals in a day. The associations have to make an effort to get into these places and give them basic facilities.\n\"But otherwise, to play cricket in India now, it's far more open and easier than before.\nShe concludes: \"The next step is to add a couple more teams to WPL, because there are many good players who get left out with just five teams.\n\"And of course winning the World Cup.\"\nHowever, as Raj sees it, the prize that would propel the Indian game forward exponentially would be Olympic gold, with cricket in LA 2028.\n\"It's a chance to get a medal for the country. I know we have the World Cups, but the medal in the Olympics is a huge thing back at home.\n\"The Olympics is the ultimate.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Nine years ago, an Indian student vanished into thin air. \nNajeeb Ahmed was studying biotechnology at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, when he mysteriously went missing in October 2016.\nThe night before his disappearance, the then 27-year-old who lived in one of the university's residential hostels was involved in a scuffle with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student group. The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. \nFor years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. \nNow a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. \n\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. \nMr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. \n\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. \n\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"\nBorn in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four. His family made many sacrifices to support his JNU education.\n\"After completing his undergraduate degree, he was adamant that he wanted to study at JNU,\" Ms Nafees said. \n\"I told him you can take admission, but you won't stay in the hostel. You are too naive. But he didn't listen to me.\"\nOn the night of 14 October, 2016, Mr Ahmed reportedly got into a scuffle with a group of students affiliated to ABVP who were campaigning for hostel elections. JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.\nIn his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. \nThe doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.\nAccording to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.\nA CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. \nMs Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. \nFor days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.\nIn November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.\nA month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. \nIn May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. \nA year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. \nThe agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.\nA one million rupees [$11,600; \u00a38,600] reward for information about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. \nThe case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. \nShe alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.\nThe agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.\n\nExplaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.\nThe judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.\n\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.\nThe court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.\nThe order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. \nColin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. \n\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. \nMs Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.\n\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked.  \n\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. \nHowever, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". \nMs Nafees says she's not done fighting. Every 15 October, the day her son vanished, she joins a candle march at JNU in his memory. The hope has dimmed, but the wait continues.\n\"Sometimes I wonder if I should put a nameplate outside our house,\" said Nafees Ahmed, his father. \n\"Our house has been renovated. What if he comes, but can't recognise it?\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "After years of border tensions, India and China appear to be gradually moving towards resetting ties - but larger challenges and suspicions remain.\nThe visit of two senior Indian officials to China late last month was seen as a sign of a thaw in bilateral relations.\nIn June, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also made separate visits as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings. \nThe SCO is a 10-member Eurasian security grouping that also includes China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. Singh's visit was the first by a senior Indian official to China in five years.\nAt the heart of India-China tensions is an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long disputed border. Rivers, lakes and snow-caps along the frontier mean the line often shifts, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes sparking skirmishes. \nThe crisis escalated in June 2020 when the two forces clashed in the Galwan valley in Ladakh in what was the first fatal confrontation between them since 1975. At least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. Stand-offs between the militaries have since taken place in several places.\nBut geopolitical uncertainty and ground realities appear to have nudged the two sides to find common ground on several issues. \nLate last year, they reached an agreement on the main friction points in Ladakh. \nIn January, Delhi and Beijing agreed to restore direct flights and relax visa curbs that were imposed after the 2020 clash. \nThe same month, Indian pilgrims were allowed to visit a sacred mountain, the Kailash, and a holy lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region after a gap of six years.\nBut experts point out there are other hurdles. \nFor India, China is the second-largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching more than $127bn (\u00a393.4bn) last year. It relies heavily on Chinese imports, particularly rare earth minerals. \nPeace in border areas, therefore, is essential to boost economic ties. \nWith its increasing focus on Taiwan, Beijing also wants peace in its Himalayan border with India - for now. \nBut at a strategic level, China suspects that Western nations are using India to counterbalance its rise and growing influence. \nSo, in addition to solving the border dispute, Beijing would want improvements in other areas as well, as it hopes to counter Delh's increasing dependence on the US and its allies for security. \nThis includes more Chinese exports; increasing investments in India, and the removal of visa restrictions for Chinese engineers and workers. (India had banned dozens of Chinese apps and imposed restrictions on Chinese investments in the aftermath of the 2020 clash, citing security concerns). \nFast-changing geopolitics - particularly in the US since President Trump assumed a second term in power - has also compelled Delhi to reach out to China, experts say. \n\"India thought it would be a very close strategic ally [of the US] but they were not getting the support they were expecting from Washington,\" Professor Christopher Clary of University of Albany in New York tells the BBC.\nDuring recent border tensions with arch-rival Pakistan in May, Delhi also witnessed the growing military co-operation between Beijing and Islamabad. Pakistan used Chinese made fighter jets, air defence systems and air-to-air missiles in the four-day conflict.\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, Trump repeatedly asserted that he had mediated between the two sides for a ceasefire.\nThis embarrassed Delhi which insists that it directly spoke with Pakistani officials to stop the fighting, and vehemently denies any third-party mediation.\nWeeks later, Trump also hosted Pakistani army chief Asim Munir for lunch at the White House, much to the dismay of Delhi. \nAt the same time, the US and India are also engaged in frantic talks to reach a trade agreement. Trump has already threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, if a deal is not reached by 1 August .\n\"Given President Trump's statements about the mediation between India and Pakistan and about the trade talks, there's a feeling in Delhi that this is the time to reach out to countries like China,\" Clary says.\nStrategic experts argue that Washington views Delhi as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But given the US president's unpredictability, there are now doubts in Delhi about how far the US will go to support India in any future conflict with China.\nThe Quadrilateral Security Dialogue \u2013 known as the Quad \u2013 involving the US, Japan, Australia and India has taken a back seat during the Trump administration's second term. \n\"In recent years, China has also significantly increased its influence in other multilateral organisations like the SCO and the Brics grouping of emerging economies,\" says Phunchok Stobdan, a former senior Indian diplomat.\nSo, India is taking a pragmatic approach, he says. \n\"At the same time, it does not want to be seen yielding too much to the Chinese demands for domestic reasons,\" he adds. \nAnd it's not just the US - India is also keenly watching how its long-time ally and major weapons supplier Russia leaned towards Beijing due to the war with Ukraine.\nWestern sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased Moscow's reliance on China for energy exports. \nMoscow also depends on Beijing for critical imports and investments, all of which has made Delhi wary of the Kremlin's position in any future confrontation with China. \nChina is also using its industrial might to squeeze many nations that depend on its imports - and countries like India feel the restrictions might impact their economic growth.\n\"China has lately been utilising trade as a weapon against India, suspending crucial exports such as rare earth magnets and fertilisers. These actions could affect India's manufacturing and agricultural sectors,\" Mr Stobdan says.\nRare earth magnets are especially crucial for automobile, home appliance and clean energy sectors. China imposed restrictions on its imports starting from April, requiring companies to obtain permits. \nAn Indian automobile industry association has warned that production could be severely impacted if the restrictions are not eased soon. Following these apprehensions, the Indian government said it was holding talks with Beijing.\nThough China is keen on boosting business, it hasn't shown any signs of compromise on its other territorial disputes with India.\nIn recent years, it has increasingly asserted its claim over the entire north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Southern Tibet.\nDelhi asserts that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country and points out that people of the state regularly vote in elections to choose their state government and there's no room for any compromise.\n\"If China and India would not abandon the concept of sovereignty, then they will continue to fight forever. If they can reach a deal on Southern Tibet [or Arunachal Pradesh], then the two countries would have eternal peace,\" Prof Shen Dingli from the Fudan University in Shanghai tells the BBC.\nFor now, both Delhi and Beijing are aware that their territorial dispute cannot be solved in the near future.\nThey seem willing to strike a working relationship that's mutually beneficial, and would want to avoid tensions altogether, rather than relying on any global power bloc for support.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Nearly 1,000 Tolkien-esque megalithic chambers dot southern India's \"Hill of the Dwarfs\", and locals believe they were created by a supernatural race of \"small people\".\nAt first glance, Hire Benkal might be mistaken for any other village nestled in Karnataka's lush interior. Surrounded by rocky hillocks, mango groves, small brick kilns and fields fed by a nearby canal, it exudes a languid, laid-back charm characteristic of rural South India.\nHowever, a 90-minute hike up one of the ridges flanking the village brought me to Moryar Gudda, or the \"Hill of the Dwarfs\", as its name means in the local Kannada language. Here, scattered across a granite-strewn plateau were nearly 1,000 prehistoric megalithic structures that have stood for more than 2,500 years. It's a startling sight: nearly as far as the eye can see, rows of giant stone chambers resembling houses and stone circles stretch across the landscape, forming one of the oldest and largest necropolises in India.\nThe trek felt like stepping into a Tolkien tale. Massive boulders teetered precariously on top of one another, creating natural sculptures that seemed on the verge of tipping over at any moment but have somehow stood firm for millennia. Some formations housed rock shelters with red ochre paintings dating from 700-500 BCE, many still vivid with scenes of creatures resembling cattle and boar whose meanings have long been lost to time.\nHistorians believe the formations were created as an ancient burial or commemorative site. However, its exact purpose remains a mystery.\nStonehenge may be the world's most famous megalithic monument, but tens of thousands of other such sites are scattered across the planet. While Europe counts more than 35,000 of these prehistoric constructions, only 3,000 or so have been documented in India. But by coming face to face with Hire Benkal's ancient, enigmatic structures and the painted scenes of battle axe-wielding horseback riders, spear-clutching hunters, and deified deer, peacocks and other animals, adventurous travellers can get a sense of how early Indian societies lived, worshipped and were laid to rest.\nThe Hire Benkal archaeological site spans roughly 20 hectares, with an east-west orientation that suggests ceremonial or astronomical significance. Dominating the landscape are giant rectangular megalithic tombs with large capstones and side walls, known as dolmen. Many of the larger dolmen are clustered around a wide, shallow water basin at the top of the hill. Experts believe this basin likely began as a natural rock pool and may have been expanded over time as ancient Indians quarried to construct additional megaliths.\nThat morning, white and pink water lilies floated in bloom across the small pond, evoking the delicate beauty of a Monet painting.\n\"It must have been a very important site for several centuries because it cannot have all been done in one time,\" said Srikumar Menon, an architect and associate professor at the National Institute of Advanced Sciences who has studied Hire Benkal and many other megaliths around the country.\nAccording to local lore, the site's dolmen weren't built by humans, but by an extinct species of dwarfs known as the \"moriyars\". These supernatural beings were said to possess immense strength and engineering prowess. As Chandrashekar Anegundi, a local naturalist who led our trek, explained: perfectly cut circular portholes on some of the dolmen have led nearby villagers to believe these legends, as the shapes are so precise that they're thought to be too sophisticated for early sculptors.\u00a0\n\"The villagers here believe moriyars were very short people and they were wiped out in a rain of fire,\" said Anegundi, who remains sceptical. \"If they were so small, how could they have lifted these big stones?\"\nDuring his research, Menon encountered similar legends referring to an ancient race of \"small people\" who allegedly constructed megalithic sites across southern India, such as at Moribetta and Morikallu nearby in Karnataka, Sanna Moriyara Thatte in Telanganaand Moral Parai in Tamil Nadu. He speculates that such folklore could be a far-reaching cultural memory of ancient Indians recalling an extinct human-like species, akin to Homo floresiensis, the so-called \"hobbit\" species discovered in Indonesia who likely lived alongside Homo sapiens 60,000 to 100,000 years ago.\n\"We know the megalith builders were humans like us,\" Menon said. \"But stories of these little people persist across the region.\"\nDespite its archaeological importance and historical intrigue, Hire Benkal remains largely unknown beyond southern India and overshadowed by the nearby Unesco World Heritage-listed temples and monuments of Hampi. The erstwhile medieval capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, located just 42km south of the megalithic site and renowned for its stunning ruins and grand temples, attracts thousands of tourists and devotees annually.\nMeanwhile, local guides report that only about 20 to 30 intrepid travellers venture to Hire Benkal some months, with a peak of roughly 100 arriving during the cooler tourist season from October to February. By comparison, Stonehenge's 83 standing stones lure more than one million visitors annually.\n\"This place has never been promoted, not even among people in nearby cities like Bengaluru,\" says Disha Ahluwalia, an archaeologist and research scholar at MSU Baroda. \"And yet, it deserves so much more attention\u2026 A lot of effort has been made by ancient humans to build them; we need to make double the effort to preserve them. And first we need to document them.\"\u00a0\nAs for the legend of the moriyas, Ahluwalia said the discovery of the site by British colonial officers in 1835 and their dismissive attitude towards ancient and rural Indian communities' technological prowess likely also fed into this myth.\n\"The officers were going to these sites without even knowing the culture. Even if the megaliths were discovered, they were not very well known. They were simply [seen as] stone slabs,\" she said.\nIn recent years, some of Hire Benkal's megalithic structures have fallen victim to vandalism, cattle herders and treasure hunters who dig beneath the dolmen in search of rumoured riches. The overgrowth of plants, the ravages of time and the lack of preservation have also taken a toll on the ancient burial grounds.\n\"It's a fragile site\u2026 people often vandalise what they don't understand,\" said Meera Iyer, convener at the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage Bengaluru, which has been actively working to include Hire Benkal as a Unesco World Heritage site. A successful nomination could provide international recognition, government funding and improved conservation measures. Local communities could also benefit from more visibility and visitors.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 What did Stonehenge sound like?\n\u2022 India's ancient engineering marvel\n\u2022 Spain's mysterious underwater 'Stonehenge'\n\"But tourism is a double-edged sword,\" Iyer warned, noting that too much of it without appropriate protection could cause the site to fall into further decay. \"What's needed is interpretation, education and better regulation.\"\u200b\nWhile Hire Benkal's future remains unclear, one thing is certain: it's a hauntingly beautiful site. As rain clouds gathered over the Deccan plateau, the land seemed to have burst with life. On the walk up, shy songbirds flitted through the bushes. Peacocks were in full regalia, their iridescent tails fanned wide as monsoon heralded mating season. Rock agamas basked lazily on sun-warmed granite, while herds of goats meandered through the underbrush. Anegundi pointed out golden amaltas trees blooming between craggy outcrops.\u00a0\n\"It's a paradise, for birds and for us,\" he said, collecting a few seed pods from the trees.\nAt Hire Benkal, the natural and the supernatural blend together. Standing at the summit, dolmen stretched out in orderly rows across the rocky ridge, boxes of stone holding the secrets of a forgotten people.\u00a0\nWhile we may never know exactly why our ancestors constructed these chambers, it is clear that this place mattered deeply to those who once lived here. For now, it remains one of India's most intriguing open-air secrets \u2013 a prehistoric monument hiding in plain sight.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "In Manhattan's West Village, where culinary trends can change with the seasons, Chef Vijay Kumar is shaping a quiet revolution. \nHis 2025 James Beard Award win for Best Chef: New York State this month is more than just personal recognition - it marks a cultural inflection point. \nChennai-based culinary historian Rakesh Raghunathan says: \"Following in the footsteps of fellow Tamil-origin recipients like Raghavan Iyer and Padma Lakshmi, Vijay Kumar's recognition reflects a growing momentum for south Indian voices on the global culinary stage\". \n\"Tamil cuisine -  along with Sri Lankan Tamil and other south Indian regional traditions - is increasingly being embraced by global diners as something refined, rich, and deeply rooted in culture.\"\nBorn in the small farming village of Natham in southern Tamil Nadu, the 44-year-old Kumar has always cooked from memory - of forests and foraging, firewood stoves and his mother and grandmother serving meals made from scratch for the family.\nWhen he took the stage at the JB awards ceremony, he said \"the food I grew up on, the food made with care, with fire, with soul is now taking the main stage\". It was a moment of deep emotion and cultural pride for Kumar. \n\"There is no such thing as a poor person's food, or a rich person's food. It's food. It's powerful. And the real luxury is to be able to connect with each other around the dinner table.\"\nFor Kumar, the win is a personal milestone but also a powerful act of visibility. \n\"When I started cooking, I never thought a dark-skinned boy from Tamil Nadu could make it to a room like this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. It was therefore important for him to wear veshti, the traditional Tamil attire for men, for the black-tie James Beard ceremony as a nod to his roots.\nRecently, Kumar was trolled by a pair of influencers in New York. Quick to rise to his defence was Padma Lakshmi, cookbook author and culinary ambassador, who called the influencers out for their cultural insensitivity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Lakshmi said \"Vijay's story is important not just for south Indian food but also as a story of someone who grew up with humble means and cooked with limited resources.\" \n\"This resourcefulness has not only propelled his work ethic but enhanced his sense of flavour, ingredients and sense of the world. He is a beacon of hope to young people all over the world that if you trust and develop your senses and skills, you can go far in a creative career.\"\nKumar's journey wasn't smooth to start with. \nUnable to afford engineering school in the big city, he chose culinary school instead - beginning his journey at Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai, cooking his way through cruise ships and kitchens, and eventually finding his promised land in America, working at Dosa in San Francisco. \nHis real breakthrough came when he partnered with Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya of Unapologetic Foods, a New York restaurant group, to open Semma - a Tamil slang word for \"fantastic\" in 2021.\nThe trio found a \"shared sense of wanting to honour our heritage, to tell the world who we really are through our cuisine\". \n\"At that moment, it wasn't just about food, it was about identity,\" Mazumdar told the BBC. \"For too long, Indian food in the US has lived under the veil of a manufactured, watered-down north-western lens. With Semma, we set out to pull back that curtain and share something more honest.\"\nKumar jumped at the opportunity to share his cuisine with the world. \"His eyes lit up when we started talking about the food we grew up eating, and that kind of food rarely makes it to restaurant menus,\" recalls Mazumdar.\nKumar's strength lies in serving authentic village food that is seasonal, hyper-local, and built entirely from scratch. His farm-to-table approach, he says, was to cook the way \"my mother and grandmother did\". Semma, he adds, is a celebration of that simplicity.\nThat simplicity resonates. \nSemma's menu defies the clich\u00e9s that often define Indian food abroad. There's no butter chicken or naan here and Kumar's epiphany came with an unlikely encounter: French escargot. \nAs a child, on days when rice was scarce, he would forage with his family for snails in the paddy fields, which would be cooked in a savoury tamarind sauce. Kumar admitted that he was ashamed of it as a boy as it \"felt like food born of poverty - until I saw the pride with which the French serve escargot\". \nToday, the dish, nathai pirattal, sits proudly on Semma's menu, reimagined not as a memory of scarcity, but as a symbol of resilience and cultural pride. \nSemma's menu - pepper rasam, tamarind crab, banana flower vadai, the ubiquitous dosa - offer an emotional connection for many diaspora diners, and a revelation for first-timers.\nKumar's intention to bring village-style Tamil food and showcase it in upscale spots and in the cut-throat New York restaurant space has won a long line of admirers. \nThere's depth, regionality and a powerful emotional connection in this food. \nThe cocktails are a nod to Tamil film stars like Rajnikanth and Silk Smitha, and the d\u00e9cor channels Chennai's warmth. Even the kitchen is a space of intention - cooks are asked to prepare food with \"gratitude and mindfulness\".\n\"I invited him to curate a black-tie gala dinner for 650 guests at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles, and he made us all proud. A year later, people still talk about how incredible the food was,\" says Lakshmi, applauding Kumar's gift for bringing regional Indian cuisine to the most glamorous platforms.\nThe awards and accolades feel like a natural progression of his journey. Semma is the first New York restaurant serving only south Indian cuisine to win a Michelin star and topped The New York Times's list for top 100 restaurants. And now the JBA for Kumar.\nIn many ways, Kumar is not just serving food - he is serving memory, pride and a quiet revolution. \nHis James Beard win is a recognition of his talent, but also an affirmation that regional Indian cuisine, with its bold spices and soulful simplicity, belongs at the centre of the global table.\nKumar's win has piqued the \"curiosity of young people from all over the Indian diaspora and instilled a greater pride in our food ways\", says Lakshmi. \"This will be his greatest legacy.\"\nAdds Mazumdar, \"This win is a signal that regionality matters, and that our stories and our roots have value on the world stage.\"",

        "article_text": "New York based trading giant Jane Street has been in the eye of a storm over the past few weeks after India's market regulator banned it from the securities market.\nThe regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has accused Jane Street of indulging in a \"sinister scheme\", alleging that its \"manipulation\" of India's stock market has led to small investors trading at \"unfavourable and misleading prices\".\nJane Street has not responded to the BBC's request for comment, but according to the Financial Times, the firm has told staff in an internal email that it was \"beyond disappointed\" by Sebi's order and planned to challenge it.\nSo what is Jane Street, and what are they accused of?\nJane Street was founded by a small group of traders and technologists in a tiny New York office. It is a quantitative trading firm which uses mathematical models and algorithms to decide trading strategies.\nThe company has more than 3000 employees who trade in a broad range of asset classes across 45 countries. According to the Financial Times, the firm accounted for over 10% of North America's equity trading volume in 2023, making it a significant player on Wall Street.\nIndia's stock market has two main segments. The cash market is where investors buy and sell actual shares of companies, owning a piece of the business. And the derivatives market is where traders use tools like futures and options to bet on stocks or commodities, without owning the underlying shares.\nSebi claims the suspicious trading activity by Jane Street happened on India's Bank Nifty index which tracks the performance of 12 large Indian banks.\nThe regulator alleges that Jane Street operated in both the cash and derivatives market through different entities.\nSo on a very basic level what is alleged is, one entity bought large quantities of bank shares \u2013 pushing up the price of Bank Nifty when the market opened in the morning.\nSimultaneously, it's claimed, the second entity would bet on the decline in Bank Nifty's value in the derivatives market.\nOn the day of expiry - when the contracts are settled in the derivative market - as the trading session inched towards close of day, Jane Street, it's claimed,  dumped the bank shares it bought in the cash market, causing the bank index price to plunge. This, in turn, would pay off the bet taken by its other entity in the derivatives market on a decline in prices, Sebi says. \n\"Such a trade is called 'marking the close' which is considered illegal even in the US,\" says Deepak Shenoy, CEO, Capitalmind Asset Management Pvt Ltd in Bengaluru city.\nMom and pop investors lost money because during the day they'd bought shares at higher levels, as they were pushed up because of the big volumes bought by Jane Street.\nSebi basically said Jane Street's activities created \"a false or misleading appearance of market activity\" and attracted \"unsuspecting\" investors to trade at levels that were \"artificial and temporary\".\nBy doing this, it was enticing unsuspecting investors to trade in Bank Nifty index options at interim levels that were artificial and temporary.\nOn 3 July, in a lengthy order, Sebi concluded that \"the integrity of the market, and the faith of millions of small investors and traders, can no longer be held hostage to the machinations of such an untrustworthy actor\".\nAs per several global media reports, Jane Street has denied all these allegations of wrongdoing and described the trades as \"basic index arbitrage\" - the price differential between the price of a stock in the cash market and its corresponding derivatives contract - saying it plans to challenge SEBI's order.\n\"Index arbitrage is legal and even Indian broking firms have done this for ages and used algorithms and machines to trade in the market. But what they (Jane Street) did is not index arbitrage,\" claims says Mr Shenoy.\n\"What they have done is taken a position in two different markets. And this is not arbitrage. You took X on one side and 7X on other side. You sold that X and gained from 7X. That is the problem,\" he explains.\n\"The same script would play out every week on expiry day when index contracts are settled,\" says Mayank Bansal, a UAE-based investor who operates in India's derivatives market . \"While retail investors lost money expecting a strong finish, Jane Street would have profited by betting on a fall and we are talking of a trade of millions of dollars.\"\n\"It is not illegal to be smarter than your counterparties in a swap transaction. However if you read the allegations made in the Sebi filing, the whole thing appears to stink very badly,\" Alexander Gerko, CEO of XTX, a rival firm of Jane Street, wrote on his LinkedIn account.\nAccording to recent data from the regulator, there are nearly 10 million retail investors in the derivatives market. In FY25 they lost 1.05 trillion rupees ($11.6bn, \u00a38.6bn) up from 750bn rupees in FY24.\nOn average, each retail investor lost 110,069 rupees ($1,283; \u00a3958) last year.\nWhile these losses cannot be attributed to Jane Street directly, Sebi says the firm made $4.3bn from India in a little over two years while small investors were bleeding.\n\"They've rigged the prices for their own convenience,\" a Mumbai-based investor, who didn't want to be named, alleged to the BBC.\n\"On 17 January 2024, Sebi says Jane Street had its most profitable day. I lost nearly $7,000, my worst single-day loss in a year.\"\nThe episode exposes deeper regulatory concerns say experts.\n\"SEBI should have acted before so many people lost their money,\" says Mr Bansal. \"The surveillance systems must be strong enough to detect and stop manipulation in real time. Who knows how many more players are operating like this here,\" he says.\nThe Indian market regulator says Jane Street has deposited just over $560mn in an escrow account with a lien marked in favour of Sebi, requesting it to lift the temporary trading ban.\nSebi says Jane Street's request to remove the trading ban is currently \"under examination\".\nBut under Indian laws, if these allegations of market manipulation are proven, the US trader could face a fine that is up to three times this amount.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo read this article\nWhile the preliminary report into what caused the loss of Air India Flight 171 last month has provided some answers, it has also prompted a wave of speculation about its cause. \nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a building less than a minute after take-off from the city of Ahmedabad in western India en route to London, killing 241 people on board, along with 19 on the ground. One passenger survived.\nInformation contained in India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau report, the first official account of what happened, has raised questions about the role of the pilots.\nHowever, experts within the aviation industry claim investigators have been highly selective in what they have chosen to say.\nUnder international protocols, the state leading an air accident investigation is meant to issue a preliminary report within 30 days. The 15-page document published by India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday fulfils this requirement.\nAlthough the AAIB has been leading the investigation, US interests are also represented, because Boeing, the maker of the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, the engine manufacturer are American.\nThe report does not set out any conclusions as to the cause of the accident. Nevertheless, it has sparked considerable controversy.\nIn its account of the accident flight, the AAIB states that two fuel cut-off switches were moved from the \"run\" to the \"cut-off\" position seconds after take-off. \nThis deprived the engines of fuel and caused them to lose thrust. Although data from the flight recorder shows the engines were subsequently restarted, it was too late to prevent the crash.\nThese switches are normally only used to turn the engines on before a flight and off afterwards. They have a locking mechanism, which means they need to be pulled out before being flipped, a system designed to prevent accidental deployment.\nThe report also states that one pilot asks the other \"why did you cut off?\", while his colleague responded that he \"did not do so\". \nHowever, it does not provide any direct transcript of the conversation, which would have been picked up by the cockpit voice recorder. Nor does it identify which pilot asked the question.\nIt is worth remembering that preliminary reports are not intended to offer a full picture of what happened or draw firm conclusions. They are meant to be a factual summary of the information obtained in the early stages of what could be a lengthy investigation. \nThe investigating authority is also under no obligation to make their preliminary reports public.\nThe information released so far has prompted a number of commentators to claim, in the media and online, that the accident was the result of deliberate and intentional action by one of the pilots.\nIt is a view that has attracted an angry response from the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, which warned that \"invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible \u2013 it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved\".\nIt added that: \"To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting\".\nIn a memo to staff, the chief executive of Air India struck a similar note. Campbell Wilson warned against drawing \"premature conclusions\".\nSince the report was issued, the BBC has spoken to a range of people within the industry, including pilots, accident investigators and engineers. While theories as to what actually happened vary widely, the dominant view is that important information is currently missing.\n\"They've told us stuff they want us to know at the moment, and withheld what they don't want us to know,\" explained one pilot, who asked not to be identified. \"It's not a complete report.\"\nOne of the main criticisms is the lack of a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, which would enable the reported conversation between the pilots about the fuel cut-off switches to be put in context.\nBjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical analyst at consultants Leeham Company said this was \"totally unacceptable\".\n\"They have all this technical detail. Then you have this reference to dialogue, but it doesn't even tell you who's speaking,\" he said.\nMr Fehrm was also concerned that there was no reference to what happened in the cockpit between the switches being flipped from run to cut-off, and the first switch being pushed back into position to relight the first engine 10 seconds later.\n\"It's someone trying to hide something,\" he said.\nAn engineering source, meanwhile, said the report was \"very selective\", and did not have any detailed information about what the engines were doing immediately before the switches were flipped. The document does say that the engine speed began to decrease from take-off values \"as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off.\"\nThis, they said was important - because flipping the switches to cut-off and back was something a pilot would be trained do to in order to restart an engine that was already losing power.\nTim Atkinson, an aviation consultant and former air accident investigator in the UK said, \"it is very disappointing to read a report which does provide a few salient facts, but leaves many more questions\".\nAnother element of the report that has caused controversy is a reference to a safety bulletin \u2013 known as a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin \u2013 published by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2018.\nThis was used to alert the aviation community that operators of some Boeing 737 models had reported cases in which the fuel cut-off switches had been fitted with the locking feature disengaged - potentially enabling the switch to be flipped by accident.\nAt the time, the FAA described this as an \"airworthiness concern\", but said it was \"not an unsafe condition\" that would require mandatory action via what is known as an Airworthiness Directive. \nOperators of a number of different Boeing models fitted with similar switches, including 787s, were advised to carry out simple inspections.\nThe investigation report says Air India did not carry out those inspections - prompting speculation that the accident could have been caused by faulty switches being flipped by accident.\nHowever, in an internal note seen by the BBC, the FAA has since reiterated its belief that the issue did not compromise safety.\nEngineering sources have also pointed out that the report says the throttle control module on the crashed aircraft was replaced on two occasions, most recently two years before the accident. This would have involved replacing the cut-off switches as well.\nAccording to Bjorn Fehrm of Leeham Company, the reference to the FAA's advice contained in the report was \"totally irrelevant\" in the context of the accident.\nNevertheless, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation has asked the operators of all aircraft covered by the FAA's original bulletin to carry out inspections by 21 July.\nFor former accident investigator Tim Atkinson, the vagueness of the report may have been deliberate - in order to suggest an explanation for the crash, while avoiding being too explicit.\n\"The very worst reports are those written to be read 'between the lines', and if that is what we have here, then it does no credit to the investigators,\" he said.\nMeanwhile those seeking firm answers to what happened on Flight 171 may well have to wait. \nInternational protocols stipulate that a final report should be published within a year of the accident.

        "summary": "One passenger survived.Information contained in India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau report, the first official account of what happened, has raised questions about the role of the pilots.However, experts within the aviation industry claim investigators have been highly selective in what they have chosen to say.What the report says Under international protocols, the state leading an air accident investigation is meant to issue a preliminary report within 30 days. \"This, they said was important - because flipping the switches to cut-off and back was something a pilot would be trained do to in order to restart an engine that was already losing power.Tim Atkinson, an aviation consultant and former air accident investigator in the UK said, \"it is very disappointing to read a report which does provide a few salient facts, but leaves many more questions\".Another element of the report that has caused controversy is a reference to a safety bulletin \u2013 known as a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin \u2013 published by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2018.This was used to alert the aviation community that operators of some Boeing 737 models had reported cases in which the fuel cut-off switches had been fitted with the locking feature disengaged - potentially enabling the switch to be flipped by accident.At the time, the FAA described this as an \"airworthiness concern\", but said it was \"not an unsafe condition\" that would require mandatory action via what is known as an Airworthiness Directive. Operators of a number of different Boeing models fitted with similar switches, including 787s, were advised to carry out simple inspections.The investigation report says Air India did not carry out those inspections - prompting speculation that the accident could have been caused by faulty switches being flipped by accident.However, in an internal note seen by the BBC, the FAA has since reiterated its belief that the issue did not compromise safety.Engineering sources have also pointed out that the report says the throttle control module on the crashed aircraft was replaced on two occasions, most recently two years before the accident. The 15-page document published by India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday fulfils this requirement.Although the AAIB has been leading the investigation, US interests are also represented, because Boeing, the maker of the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, the engine manufacturer are American.The report does not set out any conclusions as to the cause of the accident. This would have involved replacing the cut-off switches as well.According to Bjorn Fehrm of Leeham Company, the reference to the FAA's advice contained in the report was \"totally irrelevant\" in the context of the accident.Nevertheless, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation has asked the operators of all aircraft covered by the FAA's original bulletin to carry out inspections by 21 July.For former accident investigator Tim Atkinson, the vagueness of the report may have been deliberate - in order to suggest an explanation for the crash, while avoiding being too explicit.",

The crew, including Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary, will spend two weeks on the ISS.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to travel to space. His trip comes 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian to fly aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - lifted off from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 02:31 EDT (06:31 GMT; 12:01 India time) on Wednesday. \nThe docking on Thursday occurred at 06:31EDT (10:31 GMT; 16:01 India time). A pressurised vestibule was created between the spacecraft and the space station and then hatches were opened on both sides to allow the Ax-4 crew to make their way on board the ISS.\nWith their arrival, the total crew strength of ISS is now 11.\nThe mission is a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. The two European astronauts will also be taking their countries back to space after more than four decades. \nDuring their two-week mission, the crew would spend most of their time conducting 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nIsro, which has paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla on Ax-4 and his training, says the hands-on experience he will gain during his trip to the ISS will help India in its human space flights.\nIsro has said it wants to launch the country's first-ever human space flight in 2027 and has announced ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nEarlier on Thursday, Axiom Space had a live uplink with the astronauts on board where Group Captain Shukla spoke about his first 24 hours in space.\n\"What a ride!,\" he said, adding that it has been \"an amazing feeling to be just floating in space\" and that \"it's been fun time\". \n\"I was not feeling great when we got shot into vacuum, but I'm told I've been sleeping a lot, which is a great sign,\" he said laughing. \n\"I'm enjoying the view, the experience and learning anew, like a baby, how to walk, to control yourself and to eat and read,\" he added.\nAs Group Captain Shukla and other crew members spoke, Joy - a small, white toy swan described as Ax-4's \"fifth crew member\" - floated in and out of vision.\nAxiom has said Joy is \"more than a cute companion for the Ax-4 crew\" and is travelling to space as their \"zero-G [zero-gravity] indicator\".\nDuring Thursday's broadcast, Group Captain Shukla said the baby swan \"symbolises wisdom and ability to discern what is important and what is not\" which made it \"so important in this age of distractions\".\nSoon after Wednesday's launch, Commander Peggy Whitson revealed the name of their vehicle: Grace.\n\"Grace is more than a name,\" she said. \"It reflects the elegance with which we move through space against the backdrop of Earth. It speaks to the refinement of our mission, the harmony of science and spirit, and the unmerited favour we carry with humility.\"\nThe name, she added, was a reminder \"that spaceflight is not just a feat of engineering, but an act of goodwill - for the benefit of every human, everywhere\".",

Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.\nBoth Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.\nOverton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.\nIt means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2.

That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.\nEngland fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.\nThat India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.\nIf anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away. \nThere is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\nWoakes 'all in' on helping England win - Root\nThis video can not be played\n'He's put them in a winning position' - Brook century edges England closer to victory\nFrom 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.\nBut Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.\nBrook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.\nBrook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.\nA dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.\nBethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.\nNerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\nThis video can not be played\n'For the man who taught him so much' - Root marks century with Thorpe tribute\nPerhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.\nIndia left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.\nFor so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.\nSmith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.\nThe review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.\nThe crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\nThis video can not be played\nRoot edges behind to leave England six down\nThis video can not be played\nRoot reflects on Thorpe tribute and issues Woakes update\nEngland batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special: \"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone.

He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\n\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room.

        "article_text": "Long before India gained independence, one defiant voice inside the British Empire dared to call out a colonial massacre - and paid a price for it.\nSir Chettur Sankaran Nair, a lawyer, was one of the few Indians to be appointed to top government posts when the British ruled the country.   \nIn 1919, he resigned from the Viceroy's Council after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the northern Indian city of Amritsar in Punjab, in which hundreds of civilians attending a public meeting were shot dead by British troops. On the 100th anniversary of the massacre, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May described the tragedy as a \"shameful scar\" on Britain's history in India.\nNair's criticism of Punjab's then Lieutenant Governor, Michael O'Dwyer, led to a libel case against him, which helped spotlight the massacre and the actions of British officials.\nIn a biography of Nair, KPS Menon, independent India's first foreign secretary, described him as \"a very controversial figure of his time\". \nNair was known for his independent views and distaste for extremist politics, and spoke critically of colonial rule and even of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian independence hero who is now regarded as the father of the nation. \nMenon, who married Nair's daughter Saraswathy, wrote: \"Only [Nair] could have insulted the all powerful British Viceroy on his face and opposed Mahatma Gandhi openly.\"\nNair was not a familiar name in India in recent decades, but earlier this year, a Bollywood film based on the court case, Kesari Chapter 2- starring superstar Akshay Kumar - helped bring attention to his life.\nNair was born in 1857 into a wealthy family in what is now Palakkad district in Kerala state. He studied at the Presidency College in Madras, acquiring a bachelor's degree before studying law and beginning his career as an apprentice with a Madras High Court judge.\nIn 1887, he joined the social reform movement in the Madras presidency. Throughout his career, he fought to reform Hindu laws of the time on marriage and women's rights and to abolish the caste system.\nFor some years, he was a delegate to the Indian National Congress and presided over its 1897 session in Amraoti (Amravati). In his address, he held the British-run government \"morally responsible for the extreme poverty of the masses\", saying the annual famines \"claimed more victims and created more distress than under any civilised government anywhere else in the world\". \nHe was appointed public prosecutor in 1899 and writes in his autobiography about advising the government on seditious articles in newspapers, including those by his close friend G Subramania Iyer, the first editor of The Hindu newspaper. \"On many occasions\u2026 I was able to persuade them not to take any step against him.\"\nHe became a high court judge in 1908 and was knighted four years later.\nNair moved to Delhi in 1915 when he was appointed a member of the Viceroy's Council, only the third Indian to hold the position. \nHe was a fierce proponent of India's right to govern itself and pushed for constitutional reforms during his time on the council. Through 1918 and 1919, his dissent and negotiations with Edwin Montagu, then secretary of state for India, helped expand provisions of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms which laid out how India would gradually achieve self-governance.\nMontagu wrote in his diary that he had been warned \"that it was absolutely necessary to get him on my side, for Sankaran Nair wielded more influence than any other Indian\".\nA pivotal moment in Nair's career as a statesman was the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh, when hundreds of unarmed Indians were shot dead in a public garden on the day of the Baisakhi festival. Official estimates said nearly 400 people were killed and more than 1,500 wounded by the soldiers, who fired under the orders of Brigadier General REH Dyer. Indian sources put the death toll closer to 1,000.\nNair writes in his 1922 book Gandhi and Anarchy about following the events in Punjab with increasing concern. The shooting at Jallianwala Bagh was part of a larger crackdown in the province, where martial law had been introduced - the region was cut off from the rest of the country and no newspapers were allowed into it.\n\"If to govern the country, it is necessary that innocent persons should be slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh and that any Civilian Officer may, at any time, call in the military and the two together may butcher the people as at Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in,\" he wrote.\nA month later, he resigned from the council and left for Britain, where he hoped to rouse public opinion on the massacre.\nIn his memoir, Nair writes of speaking to the editor of The Westminster Gazette which soon published an article called the Amritsar Massacre. Other papers including The Times also followed suit.\n\"Worse things had happened under British rule, but I am glad I was able to obtain publicity for this one at least,\" Nair wrote.\nNair's book Gandhi and Anarchy drew the ire of several Indian nationalists of the time after he criticised Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, calling it a \"weapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our purpose\".\nBut it was the few passages condemning Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, that became the basis for the libel suit against him in 1924. \nNair accused O'Dwyer of terrorism, holding him responsible for the atrocities committed by the civil government before the imposition of martial law. \nA five-week trial in the Court of King's Bench in London ruled 11:1 in favour of O'Dwyer, awarding damages of \u00a3500 and \u00a37,000 in costs to him.\nO'Dwyer offered to forgo this for an apology but Nair refused and paid instead.\nReports of the depositions in the hearing were published daily in The Times. Nair's family says despite losing, the case achieved his purpose of having the atrocities brought to public attention. \nNair's great-grandson Raghu Palat, who co-wrote the book The Case That Shook the Empire, with his wife Pushpa, says the case helped spark \"an uproar for the freedom movement\".\nIt also showed that \"there was no point in having a dominion status under the empire when the British cannot be expected to deal with their subjects fairly\", adds Pushpa.\nEven Gandhi referred to the case several times, writing once that Nair had showed pluck in fighting without hope of victory, historian PC Roy Chaudhury later pointed out.\nAfter losing the case, Nair continued with his career in India. He was chairman of the Indian Committee of the Simon Commission, which reviewed the working of constitutional reforms in India in 1928.\nHe died in 1934 at the age of 77.\nThrough his career, Menon notes, Nair \"bent all his thoughts and energies on the emancipation of his country from the bondage of foreign domination and native custom. In this task, he achieved as much success as any man, wedded to constitutional methods\".",

In 1919, he resigned from the Viceroy's Council after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the northern Indian city of Amritsar in Punjab, in which hundreds of civilians attending a public meeting were shot dead by British troops. \"If to govern the country, it is necessary that innocent persons should be slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh and that any Civilian Officer may, at any time, call in the military and the two together may butcher the people as at Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in,\" he wrote.A month later, he resigned from the council and left for Britain, where he hoped to rouse public opinion on the massacre.In his memoir, Nair writes of speaking to the editor of The Westminster Gazette which soon published an article called the Amritsar Massacre.",

Regular audits are standard for all airlines to assess and improve their processes, an airline spokesperson said.\n\"We acknowledge receipt of the findings and will submit our response to the regulator within the stipulated time frame, along with the details of the corrective actions taken,\" the spokesperson added \nIndia's aviation regulator flagged 263 safety issues across eight commercial airlines in its annual audit, including 44 Level 2 and seven Level 1 findings at Air India. \nOther airlines with notable findings included Alliance Air (57), Ghodawat Star (41), Quick Jet (35), IndiGo (23), and SpiceJet (14).\nAccording to the UN's  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) whose standards guide Indian audits, Level 1 findings indicate non-compliance that \"lowers safety or seriously endangers safety.\"\nThese could trigger immediate action -  including suspension, restriction or even revocation of the airline's approvals.\nLevel 2 findings are less critical but still safety-related - these are non-compliances by the airlines that \"could lower or possibly hazard safety\".\nAirlines are given up to three months to implement corrective actions, which may be extended if the regulator approves the action plan.\nDetails of Air India's specific lapses in the latest audit remain unclear. But a government report cited by Reuters highlights the airline's inadequate pilot training, use of unapproved simulators, and poor rostering. \nOfficials flagged \"recurrent training gaps\" for some Boeing 787 and 777 pilots missing mandatory monitoring duties, according to Reuters.\nIn a separate statement the DGCA said that it conducted regular audits under its 'Annual Surveillance Plan' to identify safety gaps and drive improvements. \nBased on ICAO standards and global best practices, these audits \"ensure compliance\" and enhance airline operations across the board, the regulator said.\n\"It should be emphasised that, for airlines with extensive operations and large fleet sizes, a higher number of audit findings is entirely normal,\" the regulator added. \n\"The quantum and scale of their activities mean that such observations reflect the breadth and depth of their operations rather than any unusual lapse. Globally, aviation regulators routinely encounter similar patterns with major carriers due to the diversity and intensity of their undertakings.\"\nEarlier this month Reuters reported that the aviation watchdog had reprimanded Air India's budget carrier in March for delaying mandatory engine part replacements on an Airbus A320 and falsifying records to show compliance.\nAir India Express told the news agency it acknowledged the error to DGCA and undertook \"remedial action and preventive measures\".\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, the DGCA chief, said the information in this case came through \"self-reporting by the airline\".\n\"I would not condone it [the lapses]. But [at least] we have started getting these reports. This came from the airline. Action has been taken in this case. In our audits we have mandated our people to be more alert and see whether there is any lapse and bring it to our attention,\" he said. \"India's skies have always been safe.\" \nCiting ICAO data, Mr Kidwai noted India consistently outperforms the global average for accidents per million flights.\nHe said, \"Only twice between 2010 and 2024 did we exceed the global average - both years with major accidents.\"\nIn August 2020, Air India Express Flight 1344 crashed after skidding off a rain-soaked tabletop runway in Kozhikode, killing 21 people. \nA decade earlier, in May 2010, Flight 812 from Dubai overshot the runway in Mangalore and plunged into a gorge, leaving 158 dead. June's Air India crash was the third such accident in the country in 15 years.\nSince 2020, Indian domestic carriers have reported 2,461 technical faults, according to the federal civil aviation ministry data. \nIndiGo accounted for over half (1,288), followed by SpiceJet with 633, and Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express with 389 cases, as of January 2025.\n\"Reporting of snags by airlines has gone up. This is good,\" Mr Kidwai said.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm pleased about it. But I do see value in the growing culture of reporting [snags]. It's far better for every snag to be brought to the attention of the authorities than keeping quiet and operating the aircraft.\"\n",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Authorities in Yemen have postponed the execution of an Indian nurse who is on death row after being found guilty of murder, Indian foreign ministry sources say.\nNimisha Priya, who was sentenced to death for killing a local man, was set to be executed on 16 July, according to campaigners working to save her.\nThe nurse, who is from the southern Indian state of Kerala, denied murdering her former business partner Talal Abdo Mahdi, whose chopped-up body was discovered in a water tank in 2017. \nThe postponement of her execution is only a temporary reprieve - the only way she can be saved is if Mahdi's family pardons her. \nYemen's Islamic judicial system, known as Sharia, offers her one last hope - securing a pardon from the victim's family by paying diyah, or blood money, to them. Her relatives and supporters say they have raised $1m (\u00a3735,000) and offered it to Mahdi's family.\n\"We are still trying to save her. But ultimately the family has to agree for pardon,\" Babu John, a member of the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, told the BBC last week after the date for her execution was set.\nMahdi's family, however, have made clear that they will settle for nothing less than her being put to death.\n\"Our stance on the attempts at reconciliation is clear; we insist on implementing God's Law in Qisas [retaliation in kind], nothing else,\" his brother, Abdelfattah Mahdi, told BBC Arabic on Monday, before the execution was postponed.\nHe added that his family had suffered \"not only from the brutal crime but also the long, exhausting litigation process in a horrible and heinous but obvious crime case\".\n\"We feel sorry to see the attempts to distort the truth, especially from the Indian media that portrays the convicted as a victim, to justify the crime.

This is only their second defeat when doing so.\n\"We thought this pitch might get better to bat on as we went through the five days but as we saw it didn't,\" McCullum said.\nRather than blame the toss, Stokes pointed to England's inability to knock over India's lower order in the first innings, where they recovered from 211-5.\n\"No-one's got a crystal ball, no-one really knows what a wicket's going to do,\" Stokes said.\n\"Having them 211-5, we were happy there - even five down at the end of day one.\n\"We just weren't able to bust them open. We had a chance to potentially bowl them out for under 350 on that wicket, which would have been a good effort.\"\nStokes said he was not concerned by his bowlers' toil during the match.

announced in May after years of negotiations - will boost the British economy by \u00a34.8bn a year. \nThe agreement was okayed by the Indian cabinet earlier this week but has not yet been agreed by the UK parliament and is expected to take at least a year to come into effect.\nThe agreement includes lower tariffs on:\nThe government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India.\nUK exports that will see levies fall include:\nThe UK already imports \u00a311bn in goods from India but the lower tariffs agreed will make Indian exports cheaper, including for components used in advanced manufacturing.\nIndian manufacturers are also expected to gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles.\nAverage tariffs for UK exports to India will drop from 15% to 3%, making it easier for British companies to sell goods in India.\nWhisky tariffs for exports to India have been slashed in half, from 150% to 75%, giving the UK an immediate advantage over international competitors in reaching the Indian market, and the tariff will drop to 40% by 2035.\nThe two prime ministers have also agreed on closer collaboration around defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. \nEnhanced intelligence sharing and operational collaboration will also assist in tackling corruption, serious fraud, organised crime, and irregular migration.\nThis includes finalising a new sharing agreement for criminal records, which will assist court proceedings, help maintain accurate watchlists, and enable the enforcement of travel bans. \nThe deal has not given the UK as much access as it would have liked to India's financial and legal services industries, and talks continue on a bilateral investment treaty aimed at protecting British investments in India and vice versa.\nThe two nations also continue to discuss UK plans for a tax on high-carbon industries, which India believes could hit its imports unfairly.\nThe Indian government welcomed an extended exemption on national insurance contributions, calling this \"an unprecedented achievement\" when the deal was agreed in May.\nThe agreement means staff from Indian companies who are temporarily transferred to the UK, and staff from UK firms who are temporarily working in India, will only pay social security contributions in their home country, rather than in both places.\nHowever, the UK government stressed we already have similar reciprocal \"double contribution convention\" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea.\nResponding to suggestions the deal meant British workers could be undercut by cheaper Indian workers, Reynolds told BBC Breakfast: \"I can categorically tell you that is not the case.\n\"There is no tax advantage for hiring an Indian worker over a British worker.\"\nExtra costs for visas and the NHS surcharge would mean \"you'd actually pay more for an Indian worker\", he said, adding \"no-one is being undercut\".\nBBC News understands the Prime Minister raised the case of a Scottish Sikh activist in prison in India during talks with the Indian prime minister earlier today. \nJagtar Singh Johal was arrested in 2017 accused of terrorism offences but hasn't been convicted of any crime. \nHis family and legal team have been pushing the UK government to secure his release through diplomatic channels, although the Indian government has always maintained due process in being followed.\nToday's visit is Modi's fourth to the UK since he became India's prime minister in 2014. \nThe latest deal comes a year after the UK-India Technology Security Initiative was signed by Modi and Foreign Secretary David Lammy, allowing joint work on telecoms security and emerging technologies.\nNegotiations on the trade deal have taken three years, having been started by former PM Boris Johnson in 2022.\nConservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith claimed the trade deal had only been made possible \"because of Brexit delivered by the Conservatives\" and was  \"a step in the right direction\".\nBut he added: \"The irony should not be lost on anyone that any gains from this trade deal will be blown out of the water by [Deputy Prime Minister] Angela Rayner's union charter, stifling business with red tape, the jobs tax and, come autumn, Rachel Reeves' inevitable tax hikes that will punish Britain's makers just to reward those who do not contribute.\"\nHowever, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said Brexit was what had hindered UK jobs and growth and called for a new UK-EU customs union.\n\"We support the opening of trade, which is vital in the face of the tariff wars launched by Donald Trump,\" he said. \n\"But the gains from this deal are a small fraction of what the government could deliver for jobs and growth from a better deal with the EU.\n\"The government needs to cut the mountains of red-tape -

        "article_text": "Gautam Gambhir was appointed India head coach in 2024\nIndia head coach Gautam Gambhir has been involved in a confrontation with Surrey ground staff during a training session before Thursday's fifth and final Test against England at The Oval.\nVideo footage from the net session shows Gambhir pointing his finger at Lee Fortis, Surrey's head of ground staff, and the India coach can be heard shouting \"you can't tell us what to do\" and \"you're just the groundsman, nothing beyond\".\nSpeaking in a news conference afterwards, India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak - who was present during the incident - said the coaches were inspecting the wicket for the Test, and were asked to move away.  \n\"When we were standing on the wicket looking at it, one of the ground staff came and said to stand two and half metres away from here. In my cricketing career I have never seen anybody saying that,\" said Kotak. \n\"Literally he was saying that 'you can go outside the rope' to the head coach and see the wicket. I don't know how you can see. \n\"If someone was brushing their shoes, or somebody is trying to put something on the wicket or somebody wearing spikes - if the curator feels that then fine - but it was a very strange way of saying it.\" \nThis video can not be played\nKotak on Gambhir confrontation with Surrey ground staff at The Oval\nKotak continued: \"Curators are a little over-protective or possessive about the square and the ground. [They] need to understand that the people they are talking to are highly skilled and intelligent people. \n\"When you are working with very intelligent and highly skilled people, if you sound a bit arrogant, you can be protective - but at the end of the day it's a cricket pitch. It's not an antique that you can't touch because it's 200 years old and it can be broken. That's what I feel.\"\nWith no specific outdoor practice area, India used three practice wickets surrounded by nets close to the Test match pitch, which is standard procedure.\nBBC Sport asked Surrey for a comment but the club declined, though in a video Fortis later downplayed the incident, telling Indian media \"there's nothing to speak about. There's nothing to hide here\".\nThe incident is the latest in a heated and competitive series between the two sides, with the fourth Test at Old Trafford ending with India refusing to shake hands for the draw early as Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar reached centuries. \nIndia skipper Shubman Gill also said England were acting \"against the spirit of cricket\" with time-wasting tactics during the third Test at Lord's.\nEngland lead the five-match series 2-1 and Ben Stokes' side are expected to make changes to the team from Manchester's draw, particularly to the bowling line-up after just three days in between Tests. \nJamie Overton, Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue are the spare quicks in the squad after Stokes struggled with various niggles. Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse have played all four matches so far and Jofra Archer has played back-to-back after making his comeback from a four-year injury absence.\nMeanwhile India will be without wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant because of a fractured foot and they also have a decision to make on pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who has played the maximum three Tests they stated he would before the series.\nShow of Mancunian grit could be making of India captain Gill\nNo-one can stop Stokes overdoing it but himself - Agnew\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nAnalysis from BBC Sport chief cricket reporter Stephan Shemilt\nGautam Gambhir and Lee Fortis are two forthright characters. In any disagreement, neither would be prepared to cede a blade of grass.\nIt's another example of the high emotion in this series. First the tetchiness at Lord's, then the handshake handbags at Old Trafford, now this. The tension has been ramped up all the way to a live finale at The Oval. This is top-level sport where results matter and those involved care. It's little wonder things have spilled over on occasion.\nThe Oval pitch will be in the spotlight from now on. Historically a place where spinners can expect lots of involvement, that has not been the case recently.\nThere is some speculation England could leave out Liam Dawson. Under Ben Stokes they have been loathe to go into a Test without a frontline spinner - it's only happened once since he took charge.\nIt could all depend on Stokes himself. Battered and bruised after Old Trafford, there are questions over what role he can play this week.\nIf Stokes can bowl as part of a four-man seam attack, Dawson should play. If Stokes' bowling is limited, England might feel they need an extra seamer, so Dawson could miss out.\nThis video can not be played\nTensions rise as fourth Test ends in controversial draw",

        "article_text": "In Manhattan's West Village, where culinary trends can change with the seasons, Chef Vijay Kumar is shaping a quiet revolution. \nHis 2025 James Beard Award win for Best Chef: New York State this month is more than just personal recognition - it marks a cultural inflection point. \nChennai-based culinary historian Rakesh Raghunathan says: \"Following in the footsteps of fellow Tamil-origin recipients like Raghavan Iyer and Padma Lakshmi, Vijay Kumar's recognition reflects a growing momentum for south Indian voices on the global culinary stage\". \n\"Tamil cuisine -  along with Sri Lankan Tamil and other south Indian regional traditions - is increasingly being embraced by global diners as something refined, rich, and deeply rooted in culture.\"\nBorn in the small farming village of Natham in southern Tamil Nadu, the 44-year-old Kumar has always cooked from memory - of forests and foraging, firewood stoves and his mother and grandmother serving meals made from scratch for the family.\nWhen he took the stage at the JB awards ceremony, he said \"the food I grew up on, the food made with care, with fire, with soul is now taking the main stage\". It was a moment of deep emotion and cultural pride for Kumar. \n\"There is no such thing as a poor person's food, or a rich person's food. It's food. It's powerful. And the real luxury is to be able to connect with each other around the dinner table.\"\nFor Kumar, the win is a personal milestone but also a powerful act of visibility. \n\"When I started cooking, I never thought a dark-skinned boy from Tamil Nadu could make it to a room like this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. It was therefore important for him to wear veshti, the traditional Tamil attire for men, for the black-tie James Beard ceremony as a nod to his roots.\nRecently, Kumar was trolled by a pair of influencers in New York. Quick to rise to his defence was Padma Lakshmi, cookbook author and culinary ambassador, who called the influencers out for their cultural insensitivity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Lakshmi said \"Vijay's story is important not just for south Indian food but also as a story of someone who grew up with humble means and cooked with limited resources.\" \n\"This resourcefulness has not only propelled his work ethic but enhanced his sense of flavour, ingredients and sense of the world. He is a beacon of hope to young people all over the world that if you trust and develop your senses and skills, you can go far in a creative career.\"\nKumar's journey wasn't smooth to start with. \nUnable to afford engineering school in the big city, he chose culinary school instead - beginning his journey at Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai, cooking his way through cruise ships and kitchens, and eventually finding his promised land in America, working at Dosa in San Francisco. \nHis real breakthrough came when he partnered with Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya of Unapologetic Foods, a New York restaurant group, to open Semma - a Tamil slang word for \"fantastic\" in 2021.\nThe trio found a \"shared sense of wanting to honour our heritage, to tell the world who we really are through our cuisine\". \n\"At that moment, it wasn't just about food, it was about identity,\" Mazumdar told the BBC. \"For too long, Indian food in the US has lived under the veil of a manufactured, watered-down north-western lens. With Semma, we set out to pull back that curtain and share something more honest.\"\nKumar jumped at the opportunity to share his cuisine with the world. \"His eyes lit up when we started talking about the food we grew up eating, and that kind of food rarely makes it to restaurant menus,\" recalls Mazumdar.\nKumar's strength lies in serving authentic village food that is seasonal, hyper-local, and built entirely from scratch. His farm-to-table approach, he says, was to cook the way \"my mother and grandmother did\". Semma, he adds, is a celebration of that simplicity.\nThat simplicity resonates. \nSemma's menu defies the clich\u00e9s that often define Indian food abroad. There's no butter chicken or naan here and Kumar's epiphany came with an unlikely encounter: French escargot. \nAs a child, on days when rice was scarce, he would forage with his family for snails in the paddy fields, which would be cooked in a savoury tamarind sauce. Kumar admitted that he was ashamed of it as a boy as it \"felt like food born of poverty - until I saw the pride with which the French serve escargot\". \nToday, the dish, nathai pirattal, sits proudly on Semma's menu, reimagined not as a memory of scarcity, but as a symbol of resilience and cultural pride. \nSemma's menu - pepper rasam, tamarind crab, banana flower vadai, the ubiquitous dosa - offer an emotional connection for many diaspora diners, and a revelation for first-timers.\nKumar's intention to bring village-style Tamil food and showcase it in upscale spots and in the cut-throat New York restaurant space has won a long line of admirers. \nThere's depth, regionality and a powerful emotional connection in this food. \nThe cocktails are a nod to Tamil film stars like Rajnikanth and Silk Smitha, and the d\u00e9cor channels Chennai's warmth. Even the kitchen is a space of intention - cooks are asked to prepare food with \"gratitude and mindfulness\".\n\"I invited him to curate a black-tie gala dinner for 650 guests at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles, and he made us all proud. A year later, people still talk about how incredible the food was,\" says Lakshmi, applauding Kumar's gift for bringing regional Indian cuisine to the most glamorous platforms.\nThe awards and accolades feel like a natural progression of his journey. Semma is the first New York restaurant serving only south Indian cuisine to win a Michelin star and topped The New York Times's list for top 100 restaurants. And now the JBA for Kumar.\nIn many ways, Kumar is not just serving food - he is serving memory, pride and a quiet revolution. \nHis James Beard win is a recognition of his talent, but also an affirmation that regional Indian cuisine, with its bold spices and soulful simplicity, belongs at the centre of the global table.\nKumar's win has piqued the \"curiosity of young people from all over the Indian diaspora and instilled a greater pride in our food ways\", says Lakshmi. \"This will be his greatest legacy.\"\nAdds Mazumdar, \"This win is a signal that regionality matters, and that our stories and our roots have value on the world stage.\"",

One British national miraculously survived the crash. \nThe investigation led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is expected to produce a more detailed report in 12 months.\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, both of the plane's fuel control switches moved from the run to the cut-off position in the space of a second, shortly after take-off.\nThe switches are usually only cut off to turn off the engines after landing, or during emergency situations such as an engine fire - rather than during take-off.\nThe cut-off caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report said.\nThere is then confusion heard in the cockpit, with one pilot asking the other why he had switched off the fuel, which the other denied. The Gatwick-bound plane was being piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar. The report does not specify which voice is which.\nThe fuel switches then moved back into their normal in-flight position, automatically starting the process of relighting the engines. One engine, the report said, was able to regain thrust - but could not reverse the plane's deceleration. \nOne of the pilots submitted a Mayday call just before the plane plummeted and crashed into a building used as doctors' accommodation, causing an explosion.\nBoth pilots had an \"adequate rest period prior\" to the flight, the report said.\nExperts had previously speculated that birds could have caused the crash, but the report said that \"no significant bird activity\" was observed in the vicinity of the plane's flight path.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin in 2019 highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged, the report said.\nThe issue was not deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation.\nThe same switch design is used in Air India's VT-ANB aircraft which crashed. As the bulletin was advisory, Air India did not perform inspections. \nExperts who spoke to the BBC offered differing opinions on whether this could have played a factor.\nAn Air India spokesperson said the airline acknowledged receipt of the preliminary report.\n\"We continue to fully co-operate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB,\" the Air India spokesperson added.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it would defer to AAIB to provide information about the crashed plane, in adherence with protocol under the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (Icao).

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "In late July, lawyer Indira Jaising mounted a challenge against the legal age for having sex in India - which is 18 years - in the Supreme Court, renewing conversations around the criminalisation of teen sex.\nMs Jaising argued that consensual sex between 16 and 18-year-olds is neither exploitative nor abusive and urged the court to exempt it from criminal prosecution.\n\"The purpose of age-based laws is to prevent abuse, not to criminalise consensual, age-appropriate intimacy,\" Ms Jaising has said in her written submissions to the court.\nBut the federal government has opposed this, saying that introducing such an exemption would jeopardise the safety and protection of children (persons under the age of 18, according to Indian laws), opening them up to abuse and exploitation.\nThe case has re-ignited debate around consent and whether Indian laws, especially the country's main law against child sexual abuse - Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 or Pocso - should be altered to introduce a provision exempting 16 to 18 year-olds having consensual sex from their ambit.\nChild rights activists say exempting teens protects their autonomy, while opponents warn it could fuel crimes like trafficking and child marriage.\nExperts question whether teens can bear the burden of proof if abused. More importantly, who decides the age of consent laws - and whose interests do they truly serve?\nLike many countries, India has struggled to set its age of sexual consent. Unlike the US, where it varies by state, India enforces a uniform age nationwide.\nIndia's legal age for having sex is also much higher than most European countries, or places like UK and Canada, where it is 16.\nIt was 10 years when India's criminal code was enacted in 1860 and was increased to 16 in 1940 when the code was amended.\nPocso introduced the next major change, pushing the \"age of consent\" to 18 years in 2012. A year later, India's criminal laws were amended to reflect this change and the country's new criminal code, introduced in 2024, has adhered to this revised age.\nBut over the past decade or so, many child rights activists and even courts have taken a critical view of the country's legal age to have sex and have called for it to be lowered to 16 years. \nThey say the law criminalises consensual teen relationships and is often misused by adults to control or block relationships - especially those of girls.\nSex remains a taboo topic in the country even though studies have shown that millions of Indian teenagers are sexually active.\n\"As a society, we're also divided along caste, class and religious lines, which makes the [age of consent] law even more susceptible to misuse,\" says Sharmila Raje, co-founder of Foundation for Child Protection-Muskaan, a non-profit working to prevent child sexual abuse for over two decades.\nIn 2022, the Karnataka High court directed India's Law Commission -  an executive panel that advices the government on legal reform - to rethink the age of consent under Pocso, \"so as to take into consideration the ground realities\".\nIt noted several cases where girls over 16 fell in love, eloped, and had sex, only for the boy to be charged with rape and abduction under Pocso and criminal law.\nIn its report the following year, the Law Commission ruled out lowering the age of consent, but recommended \"guided judicial discretion\" during sentencing in cases involving \"tacit approval\" from children aged 16 to 18 years, meaning where the relationship has been consensual.\nThough this is yet to be implemented, courts across the country have been using this principle to allow for appeals, grant bail, make acquittals and even quash cases after taking into consideration the facts of the case and the victim's testimony.  \nMany child rights activists, including Ms Raje, urge this provision be codified to standardise enforcement; left as a suggestion, courts may ignore it.\nIn April, the Madras High Court overturned the acquittal in a case where the 17-year-old victim was in a relationship with the 23-year-old accused and the two eloped after the victim's parents arranged her marriage to another man. The accused was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\n\"The court adopted a literal interpretation of the Pocso Act,\" Shruthi Ramakrishnan, a researcher at Enfold Proactive Health Trust - a child rights charity - noted in her column in The Indian Express newspaper, calling it a \"grave miscarriage of justice\".\nMs Jaising argues that judicial discretion at sentencing isn't enough, as the accused still faces lengthy investigations and trials.\nIndia's judicial system is infamously slow with millions of cases pending across all court levels. A research paper by India Child Protection Fund found that as of January 2023, nearly 250,000 Pocso cases were pending in special courts set up to try these cases.\n\"The process is the punishment for many,\" Ms Jaising notes. \n\"A case-by-case approach leaving it to the discretion of judges is also not the best solution as it can result in uneven results and does not take into account the possibility of bias,\" she adds.\nShe urges the court to add a \"close-in-age exception\" for consensual sex between 16- and 18-year-olds in Pocso and related laws. This \"close-in-age exception\" would prevent consensual acts between peers in that age group from being treated as crimes.\nLawyer and child rights activist Bhuwan Ribhu warns that a blanket exception could be misused in cases of kidnapping, trafficking, and child marriage. He advocates judicial discretion paired with a justice system overhaul.\n\"We need faster processes so that cases are disposed off in a time-bound manner. We also need better rehabilitation facilities and compensation for victims,\" he says.\nEnakshi Ganguly, co-founder of HAQ: Centre for Child Rights, however, agrees with Ms Jaising. \n\"We can't shy away from making changes because we're afraid of the law being misused,\" she says, adding that Ms Jaising's argument is not new as over the years, many activists and experts have made similar recommendations.\n\"Laws need to keep pace with changes in society if they are to remain effective and relevant,\" she says.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "India's aviation regulator has uncovered 51 safety violations at Air India during the past year, as part of its annual audit of the country's airlines.\nAlthough unrelated to last month's Air India Boeing 787 crash that killed 260 people, the findings come amid renewed scrutiny of the airline after the tragedy.\nSeven safety-related lapses were of the highest level, the auditors said, but did not provide details.\nAir India said the airline was \"fully transparent\" during the Directorate General of Civil Aviation's (DGCA) July audit, which was part of routine checks to improve systems. Regular audits are standard for all airlines to assess and improve their processes, an airline spokesperson said.\n\"We acknowledge receipt of the findings and will submit our response to the regulator within the stipulated time frame, along with the details of the corrective actions taken,\" the spokesperson added \nIndia's aviation regulator flagged 263 safety issues across eight commercial airlines in its annual audit, including 44 Level 2 and seven Level 1 findings at Air India. \nOther airlines with notable findings included Alliance Air (57), Ghodawat Star (41), Quick Jet (35), IndiGo (23), and SpiceJet (14).\nAccording to the UN's  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) whose standards guide Indian audits, Level 1 findings indicate non-compliance that \"lowers safety or seriously endangers safety.\"\nThese could trigger immediate action -  including suspension, restriction or even revocation of the airline's approvals.\nLevel 2 findings are less critical but still safety-related - these are non-compliances by the airlines that \"could lower or possibly hazard safety\".\nAirlines are given up to three months to implement corrective actions, which may be extended if the regulator approves the action plan.\nDetails of Air India's specific lapses in the latest audit remain unclear. But a government report cited by Reuters highlights the airline's inadequate pilot training, use of unapproved simulators, and poor rostering. \nOfficials flagged \"recurrent training gaps\" for some Boeing 787 and 777 pilots missing mandatory monitoring duties, according to Reuters.\nIn a separate statement the DGCA said that it conducted regular audits under its 'Annual Surveillance Plan' to identify safety gaps and drive improvements. \nBased on ICAO standards and global best practices, these audits \"ensure compliance\" and enhance airline operations across the board, the regulator said.\n\"It should be emphasised that, for airlines with extensive operations and large fleet sizes, a higher number of audit findings is entirely normal,\" the regulator added. \n\"The quantum and scale of their activities mean that such observations reflect the breadth and depth of their operations rather than any unusual lapse. Globally, aviation regulators routinely encounter similar patterns with major carriers due to the diversity and intensity of their undertakings.\"\nEarlier this month Reuters reported that the aviation watchdog had reprimanded Air India's budget carrier in March for delaying mandatory engine part replacements on an Airbus A320 and falsifying records to show compliance.\nAir India Express told the news agency it acknowledged the error to DGCA and undertook \"remedial action and preventive measures\".\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, the DGCA chief, said the information in this case came through \"self-reporting by the airline\".\n\"I would not condone it [the lapses]. But [at least] we have started getting these reports. This came from the airline. Action has been taken in this case. In our audits we have mandated our people to be more alert and see whether there is any lapse and bring it to our attention,\" he said. \"India's skies have always been safe.\" \nCiting ICAO data, Mr Kidwai noted India consistently outperforms the global average for accidents per million flights.\nHe said, \"Only twice between 2010 and 2024 did we exceed the global average - both years with major accidents.\"\nIn August 2020, Air India Express Flight 1344 crashed after skidding off a rain-soaked tabletop runway in Kozhikode, killing 21 people. \nA decade earlier, in May 2010, Flight 812 from Dubai overshot the runway in Mangalore and plunged into a gorge, leaving 158 dead. June's Air India crash was the third such accident in the country in 15 years.\nSince 2020, Indian domestic carriers have reported 2,461 technical faults, according to the federal civil aviation ministry data. \nIndiGo accounted for over half (1,288), followed by SpiceJet with 633, and Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express with 389 cases, as of January 2025.\n\"Reporting of snags by airlines has gone up. This is good,\" Mr Kidwai said.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm pleased about it. But I do see value in the growing culture of reporting [snags]. It's far better for every snag to be brought to the attention of the authorities than keeping quiet and operating the aircraft.\"\n",

        "article_text": "After years of border tensions, India and China appear to be gradually moving towards resetting ties - but larger challenges and suspicions remain.\nThe visit of two senior Indian officials to China late last month was seen as a sign of a thaw in bilateral relations.\nIn June, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also made separate visits as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings. \nThe SCO is a 10-member Eurasian security grouping that also includes China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. Singh's visit was the first by a senior Indian official to China in five years.\nAt the heart of India-China tensions is an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long disputed border. Rivers, lakes and snow-caps along the frontier mean the line often shifts, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes sparking skirmishes. \nThe crisis escalated in June 2020 when the two forces clashed in the Galwan valley in Ladakh in what was the first fatal confrontation between them since 1975. At least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. Stand-offs between the militaries have since taken place in several places.\nBut geopolitical uncertainty and ground realities appear to have nudged the two sides to find common ground on several issues. \nLate last year, they reached an agreement on the main friction points in Ladakh. \nIn January, Delhi and Beijing agreed to restore direct flights and relax visa curbs that were imposed after the 2020 clash. \nThe same month, Indian pilgrims were allowed to visit a sacred mountain, the Kailash, and a holy lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region after a gap of six years.\nBut experts point out there are other hurdles. \nFor India, China is the second-largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching more than $127bn (\u00a393.4bn) last year. It relies heavily on Chinese imports, particularly rare earth minerals. \nPeace in border areas, therefore, is essential to boost economic ties. \nWith its increasing focus on Taiwan, Beijing also wants peace in its Himalayan border with India - for now. \nBut at a strategic level, China suspects that Western nations are using India to counterbalance its rise and growing influence. \nSo, in addition to solving the border dispute, Beijing would want improvements in other areas as well, as it hopes to counter Delh's increasing dependence on the US and its allies for security. \nThis includes more Chinese exports; increasing investments in India, and the removal of visa restrictions for Chinese engineers and workers. (India had banned dozens of Chinese apps and imposed restrictions on Chinese investments in the aftermath of the 2020 clash, citing security concerns). \nFast-changing geopolitics - particularly in the US since President Trump assumed a second term in power - has also compelled Delhi to reach out to China, experts say. \n\"India thought it would be a very close strategic ally [of the US] but they were not getting the support they were expecting from Washington,\" Professor Christopher Clary of University of Albany in New York tells the BBC.\nDuring recent border tensions with arch-rival Pakistan in May, Delhi also witnessed the growing military co-operation between Beijing and Islamabad. Pakistan used Chinese made fighter jets, air defence systems and air-to-air missiles in the four-day conflict.\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, Trump repeatedly asserted that he had mediated between the two sides for a ceasefire.\nThis embarrassed Delhi which insists that it directly spoke with Pakistani officials to stop the fighting, and vehemently denies any third-party mediation.\nWeeks later, Trump also hosted Pakistani army chief Asim Munir for lunch at the White House, much to the dismay of Delhi. \nAt the same time, the US and India are also engaged in frantic talks to reach a trade agreement. Trump has already threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, if a deal is not reached by 1 August .\n\"Given President Trump's statements about the mediation between India and Pakistan and about the trade talks, there's a feeling in Delhi that this is the time to reach out to countries like China,\" Clary says.\nStrategic experts argue that Washington views Delhi as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But given the US president's unpredictability, there are now doubts in Delhi about how far the US will go to support India in any future conflict with China.\nThe Quadrilateral Security Dialogue \u2013 known as the Quad \u2013 involving the US, Japan, Australia and India has taken a back seat during the Trump administration's second term. \n\"In recent years, China has also significantly increased its influence in other multilateral organisations like the SCO and the Brics grouping of emerging economies,\" says Phunchok Stobdan, a former senior Indian diplomat.\nSo, India is taking a pragmatic approach, he says. \n\"At the same time, it does not want to be seen yielding too much to the Chinese demands for domestic reasons,\" he adds. \nAnd it's not just the US - India is also keenly watching how its long-time ally and major weapons supplier Russia leaned towards Beijing due to the war with Ukraine.\nWestern sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased Moscow's reliance on China for energy exports. \nMoscow also depends on Beijing for critical imports and investments, all of which has made Delhi wary of the Kremlin's position in any future confrontation with China. \nChina is also using its industrial might to squeeze many nations that depend on its imports - and countries like India feel the restrictions might impact their economic growth.\n\"China has lately been utilising trade as a weapon against India, suspending crucial exports such as rare earth magnets and fertilisers. These actions could affect India's manufacturing and agricultural sectors,\" Mr Stobdan says.\nRare earth magnets are especially crucial for automobile, home appliance and clean energy sectors. China imposed restrictions on its imports starting from April, requiring companies to obtain permits. \nAn Indian automobile industry association has warned that production could be severely impacted if the restrictions are not eased soon. Following these apprehensions, the Indian government said it was holding talks with Beijing.\nThough China is keen on boosting business, it hasn't shown any signs of compromise on its other territorial disputes with India.\nIn recent years, it has increasingly asserted its claim over the entire north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Southern Tibet.\nDelhi asserts that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country and points out that people of the state regularly vote in elections to choose their state government and there's no room for any compromise.\n\"If China and India would not abandon the concept of sovereignty, then they will continue to fight forever. If they can reach a deal on Southern Tibet [or Arunachal Pradesh], then the two countries would have eternal peace,\" Prof Shen Dingli from the Fudan University in Shanghai tells the BBC.\nFor now, both Delhi and Beijing are aware that their territorial dispute cannot be solved in the near future.\nThey seem willing to strike a working relationship that's mutually beneficial, and would want to avoid tensions altogether, rather than relying on any global power bloc for support.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Her relatives and supporters say they have raised $1m (\u00a3735,000) and offered it to Mahdi's family.\n\"We are still trying to save her.

        "article_text": "Auction house Sotheby's has returned a set of sacred jewels believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains to India, after facing mounting pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders.\nThe Piprahwa Gems - described by archaeologists as one of the most astonishing finds of the modern era - were due to be auctioned in Hong Kong in May. But the sale was called off following diplomatic intervention and threats of legal action from Delhi.\nThe Mumbai-based conglomerate Godrej Industries Group has acquired the jewels, Sotheby's said.\nSotheby's said it was \"delighted\" to facilitate the return, following two months of negotiations involving the owner, the new buyer and the Indian government. The relics will now go on permanent public display in India, the auction house said.    \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the return on Wednesday, calling it a \"proud and joyous moment\" and a victory for the country's cultural heritage. The relics, he said on X, were coming home after 127 years.\nGodrej Industries Group, the buyer of the jewels, serves over 1.1 billion consumers worldwide across sectors including consumer goods, real estate, agriculture, finance, and chemicals, according to its website. Many of its products are household names in India.\n\"We are deeply honoured to contribute to this historic moment. The Piprahwa gems are not just artefacts - they are timeless symbols of peace, compassion, and the shared heritage of humanity,\" Pirojsha Godrej, Executive Vice Chairperson of Godrej Industries Group, was quoted as saying in a government press statement.\nUnearthed in 1898 by English estate manager William Claxton Pepp\u00e9 from a stupa in Piprahwa in northern India, near the Buddha's birthplace, the cache included nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, sapphires and gold sheets -  buried alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself.\nPepp\u00e9 eventually handed most of the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.\nFor over a century, the rest of the dazzling jewels remained largely hidden in a British private collection. \nA set of 300 gems held by the Pepp\u00e9 family was publicly displayed at Sotheby's Hong Kong in February and May. Over the past six years, the gems have appeared in major exhibitions, including The Met in 2023. The family has also launched a website to share their research.\nHistorians consider the relics the shared heritage of the Buddha's Sakya clan and Buddhists worldwide. The bone fragments have since been distributed to countries like Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, where they remain objects of veneration.\nThe planned sale of the Buddha relics by Sotheby's in Hong Kong had sparked widespread ethical concerns, with scholars and Buddhist leaders questioning whether sacred objects -  especially those linked to human remains - should be treated as commodities. \nCritics challenged the seller's authority to auction the relics, while defenders said a transparent sale was the fairest way to transfer custody. For many Buddhists, the jewels are inseparable from the sacred remains and meant to be venerated, not sold.\n\"Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?\" Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian, had told the BBC in May. \"And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?\n\"Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask \u2013 custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?\"\nChris Pepp\u00e9, great-grandson of William, had told the BBC in May that the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".\nHe said that in all the monasteries he had visited \"no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics\".\n\"A few Buddhist academics at Western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such. It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,\" he said.\nOn 7 May, Sotheby's postponed the auction of the jewels following media reports and concerns raised by the Indian government, citing the need for further discussions. A week later, it confirmed ongoing talks with India to find a mutually agreeable resolution.\nThis week, confirming the return of the jewels, Sotheby's said it was \"grateful to the Pepp\u00e9 family for having safeguarded the gems and for having worked with us \u2013 and with the Government of India - in good faith to achieve this historic outcome\".",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "The Keeladi village in India's southern Tamil Nadu state has unearthed archeological finds that have sparked a political and historical battle.\nAmid coconut groves, a series of 15ft (4.5m) deep trenches reveal ancient artefacts buried in layers of soil - fragments of terracotta pots, and traces of long-lost brick structures.\nExperts from the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology estimate the artefacts to be 2,000 to 2,500 years old, with the oldest dating back to around 580 BCE. They say these findings challenge and reshape existing narratives about early civilisation in the Indian subcontinent.\nWith politicians, historians, and epigraphists weighing in, Keeladi has moved beyond archaeology, becoming a symbol of state pride and identity amid competing historical narratives.\nYet history enthusiasts say it remains one of modern India's most compelling and accessible discoveries - offering a rare opportunity to deepen our understanding of a shared past.\nKeeladi, a village 12km (7 miles) from Madurai on the banks of the Vaigai river, was one of 100 sites shortlisted for excavation by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) archaeologist Amarnath Ramakrishnan in 2013. \nHe selected a 100-acre site there because of its proximity to ancient Madurai and the earlier discovery of red-and-black pottery ware by a schoolteacher in 1975.\nSince 2014, 10 excavation rounds at Keeladi have uncovered over 15,000 artefacts - burial urns, coins, beads, terracotta pipes and more - from just four of the 100 marked acres. Many are now displayed in a nearby museum.\nAjay Kumar, leading the state archaeology team at Keeladi, says the key finds are elaborate brick structures and water systems - evidence of a 2,500-year-old urban settlement.\n\"This was a literate, urban society where people had separate spaces for habitation, burial practices and industrial work,\" Mr Kumar says, noting it's the first large, well-defined ancient urban settlement found in southern India.\nSince the Indus Valley Civilisation's discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilisation's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.\nSo, the Keeladi finds have sparked excitement across Tamil Nadu and beyond.\nWilliam Daniel, a teacher from neighbouring Kerala, said the discoveries made him feel proud about his heritage.\n\"It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilisation is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],\" he says.\nThe politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep-rooted north-south divide - underscoring how understanding the present requires grappling with the past.\nIndia's first major civilisation - the Indus Valley - emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 and 1300 BCE. After its decline, a second urban phase, the Vedic period, rose in the Gangetic plains, lasting until the 6th Century BCE.\nThis phase saw major cities, powerful kingdoms and the rise of Vedic culture - a foundation for Hinduism. As a result, urbanisation in ancient India is often viewed as a northern phenomenon, with a dominant narrative that the northern Aryans \"civilised\" the Dravidian south.\nThis is especially evident in the mainstream understanding of the spread of literacy. \nIt is believed that the Ashokan Brahmi script - found on Mauryan king Ashoka's rock edicts in northern and central India, dating back to the 3rd Century BCE - is the predecessor of most scripts in South and Southeast Asia.\nEpigraphists like Iravatham Mahadevan and Y Subbarayalu have long held the view that the Tamil Brahmi script - the Tamil language spoken in Tamil Nadu and written in the Brahmi script -  was an offshoot of the Ashokan Brahmi script.\nBut now, archaeologists from the Tamil Nadu state department say that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative.\n\"We have found graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Ashokan Brahmi script. We believe that both scripts developed independently and, perhaps, emerged from the Indus Valley script,\" Mr Kumar says.\nEpigraphist S Rajavelu, former professor of marine archaeology at the Tamil University, agrees with Mr Kumar and says other excavation sites in the state too have unearthed graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE.\nBut some experts say that more research and evidence are needed to conclusively prove the antiquity of the Tamil Brahmi script.\nAnother claim by the state department of archaeology that has ruffled feathers is that the graffiti found on artefacts in Keeladi is similar to that found in the Indus Valley sites.\n\"People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to a period of urbanisation taking place in Keeladi at the same time it was taking place in the Gangetic plains,\" Mr Kumar says, adding that further excavations are needed to fully grasp the settlement's scale.\nBut Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible.\n\"Considering the rudimentary state of travel back then, people from the Indus Valley would not have been able to migrate to the south in such large numbers to set up civilisation,\" he says. He believes the finds in Keeladi can be likened to a small \"settlement\".\nWhile archaeologists debate the findings, politicians are already drawing links between Keeladi and the Indus Valley - some even claim the two existed at the same time or that the Indus Valley was part of an early southern Indian, or Dravidian, civilisation.\nThe controversy over ASI archaeologist Mr Ramakrishnan's transfer - who led the Keeladi excavations - has intensified the site's political tensions.\nIn 2017, after two excavation rounds, the ASI transferred Mr Ramakrishnan, citing protocol. The Tamil Nadu government accused the federal agency of deliberately hindering the digs to undermine Tamil pride.\nThe ASI's request in 2023 for Mr Ramakrishnan to revise his Keeladi report - citing a lack of scientific rigour - has intensified the controversy. He refused, insisting his findings followed standard archaeological methods.\nIn June, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin called the federal government's refusal to publish Mr Ramakrishnan's report an \"onslaught on Tamil culture and pride\". State minister Thangam Thennarasu accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led federal government of deliberately suppressing information to erase Tamilian history.\nIndia's Culture Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has now clarified that Mr Ramakrishnan's report has not been rejected by the ASI but is \"under review,\" with expert feedback yet to be finalised.\nBack at the the Keeladi museum, children explore exhibits during a school visit while construction continues outside to create an open-air museum at the excavation site.\nJournalist Sowmiya Ashok, author of an upcoming book on Keeladi, recalls the thrill of her first visit.\n\"Uncovering history is a journey to better understand our shared past. Through small clues - like carnelian beads from the northwest or Roman copper coins - Keeladi reveals that our ancestors were far more connected than we realise,\" she says. \n\"The divisions we see today are shaped more by the present than by history.\"\n",

        "article_text": "When the preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 - which killed 260 people in June - was released, many hoped it would bring some measure of closure.\nInstead, the 15-page report further stoked speculation. For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.\nSeconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why \"did he cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.\nSeveral speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. \nThe Wall Street Journal and Reuters news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". \nItalian newspaper Corriere della Sera claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".\nSumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.\nUnderstandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.\nLast week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".\nJennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were \"premature and speculative\" and that \u201cinvestigations of this magnitude take time\".  \nBack in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. \nSam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.\nAt the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. \nA Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents several possibilities.\nFor example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. \n\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.\n\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".\n\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"\nInvestigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". \nA glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.\nHowever, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.\nSpeculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.\nThe preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. \nThis selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?\nPeter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.\n\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"\nInvestigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.\n\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.\nAt the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. \nIndian newspapers including the Indian Express flagged a possible electrical fire in the tail as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.\nLast week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".\n\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\". He also pledged to share updates on \"technical or public interest matters\" as they arise.\nSumming up, Mr Pruchnicki said the probe \"boils down to two possibilities - either deliberate action or confusion, or an automation-related issue\".\n\"The report doesn't rush to blame human error or intent; there's no proof it was done intentionally,\" he added.\nIn other words, no smoking gun - just an uneasy wait for answers that may never even fully emerge.",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "What comes to mind when you think of a big fat Indian wedding?\nDazzling lights, glittering outfits, Bollywood hits, a lavish spread of food and an atmosphere soaked in celebration. Everything feels extravagant, emotional and larger than life.\nNow imagine all of that without the bride and groom. No pheras (a Hindu marriage ritual where the couple takes seven rounds around a sacred fire), no relatives, no tearful farewells. Just the party.\nWelcome to the world of fake weddings - a rising trend in Indian cities where people gather to enjoy the wedding party, minus the actual marriage. \nThese ticketed events, organised by hotels, clubs and companies, are designed purely for fun and promise to offer the full experience of a wedding party without any stress, rituals or responsibilities. Simply put, it's a wedding-themed party night.\nOver the past few weeks, fake weddings have been making a splash in big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The attendees are usually young people looking to enjoy a night out with friends, indulging in the drama and fun of a traditional Indian wedding without the attendant pressures.\nLast week, we attended one such curated event in Delhi - a fake sangeet (a sangeet is a night of music and dance usually held a few days before the wedding).\nAt the event, held at a plush club, the vibe was electric: women twirled in sequinned saris and lehengas (long skirts and blouses), men showed up in tailored kurtas and ethnic jackets. A traditional dhol drummer led the crowd to the dance floor and tequila-filled gol gappas (a popular Indian street snack) made the rounds.\nShivangi Sareen, who attended an event like this for the first time, found it \"amazing\".\n\"At family weddings, there's so much pressure - the rules around dressing up, the judgement [from relatives]. But here, it's just fun,\" she said. \"Especially because we got to do it all with our friends. We decided our outfits the day before and got ready together.\"\nTicket prices typically start at around 1,500 rupees ($17; \u00a313) and can go up to 15,000 rupees or more, depending on the venue and facilities. Shivangi and her friends paid 10,000 rupees per couple to attend.\n\"I wouldn't mind spending this once a month. The whole experience was totally worth it.\"\nSharad Madan, owner of a restaurant which hosted the event, says the trend underscores that novelty is key in the hospitality sector.\n\"We have to keep doing something new for our patrons,\" he said.\nIt cost them around a million rupees to plan and organise the event, Mr Madan says, and the team expected to make double that through ticket sales. But it's not just about profits, he says.\n\"It's about engagement. Even if it doesn't give me the same kind of returns, I would still do it because our patrons want something different.\"\nKaushal Chanani, co-founder of 8Club events which hosted a fake wedding party attended by 2,000 people in Bengaluru last month, says that the inspiration for fake weddings came from young Indians living abroad.\n\"People from the diaspora would gather and dance to Bollywood music, dress in ethnic [traditional] clothes and enjoy the evening,\" he said. \"This is the idea we followed as well.\"\nThe response to the Bengaluru event, held at a five-star hotel, was \"overwhelming\", he says. It encouraged them to plan a similar event in Delhi - which was sold out - and they started getting queries from event organisers in other cities such as Jaipur, Kolkata and Lucknow.\n\"We now give out our standard operating procedure (SOP) to people who are interested,\" he says. \"It is a guide on how to create the experience, market it and make it profitable.\"\nHowever, not all fake weddings follow the same script.\nThird Place, an experience-based start-up, recently hosted a sober sangeet in Bengaluru - no alcohol, just a themed celebration.\n\"We divided attendees into groom and bride's teams and organised games like charades and guessing who the relative is from a stereotype,\" said CEO Anurag Pandey.\nThere were dhol drums, a grand welcome for all guests and even astrology-themed games. Alcohol was deliberately left out.\n\"Sometimes booze takes away from the experience,\" Mr Pandey said. \"We wanted to do more than just a pub night or a regular takeover. We wanted to showcase the spirit of Indian weddings.\"\nCommentators say the popularity of these events reflects young people's growing desire to find reasons to celebrate.\n\"People need a hook of some kind\u2026 an occasion to celebrate. And there's no better setting than a wedding, which brings together all the elements of fun,\" says writer and social commentator Santosh Desai.\n\"It's the pinnacle of enjoyment - especially when it's free from the stress that accompanies real weddings.\"\nHe also points out that these events give people a reason to re-wear expensive wedding outfits bought in the past.\nSo, are such events here to stay?\nEvent planner Vijay Arora, founder of Delhi-based Touchwood Events, believes fake weddings are currently a fad - but one with potential.\n\"Gen Z definitely wants to be part of such celebrations,\" he said.\n\"If it emerges as a new market category then it can be a major game changer since the scale will increase - which eventually amps up business opportunities for the entire industry.\"\nIndia's wedding industry is estimated to be worth around $130bn, according to investment advisory firm Wright Research.\nWhile the sector is booming, there are constraints. Most weddings take place during the cooler months - typically between November and March - and often at auspicious times, while the monsoon season (June to August) is considered off-season.\nWith venues free, vendors available and people constantly chasing experiences, fake weddings could step in to fill the gap if the trend holds.\nMr Arora says he was surprised by the rise of fake weddings.\n\"But it also helps in understanding that such events are something that we want to celebrate or be a part of. Even if we can't attend the real events our friends or family host, we still want to experience them by joining these fake ones.\"\nHowever, not every guest walks away thrilled.\nSrishti Sharma, a 23-year-old Bengaluru-based marketing professional, said she was underwhelmed by the only fake wedding she attended.\n\"I've lived away from home for a few years now and I really missed attending a wedding,\" she said.\n\"The biggest plus was not having nagging relatives telling you 'you're next in line to get married'.\"\nMs Sharma and her friends spent hours picking outfits, but the event fell short.\n\"They began with EDM and switched to Bollywood only after two hours,\" she said.\n\"We expected wedding food but got pizza and fries - no dessert, just alcohol. The decor was basic and felt lazy.\"\nSome have criticised the events, saying they could come across as trivialising traditional Indian events and values.\nBut Vidhi Kapoor, who attended the fake sangeet in Delhi, disagrees.\n\"It might have been offensive had people been asked to dress up like a bride or groom but here it's just a party, we should take it in high spirits,\" she said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "One of the engines of the Air India plane that crashed last week was new, while the other was not due for servicing until December, the airline's chairman has said.\nIn an interview with an Indian news channel, N Chandrasekaran said that both engines of the aircraft had \"clean\" histories.\n\"The right engine was a new engine put in March 2025. The left engine was last serviced in 2023 and due for its next maintenance check in December 2025,\" he told Times Now channel. \nAt least 270 people, most of them passengers, were killed last Thursday when AI171, a London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in western India.\nInvestigators are now sifting through debris and decoding recorded flight data and cockpit audio - from the aircraft's black boxes which have been found - to deconstruct the flight's final moments and determine the cause of the incident.\n\"There are a lot of speculations and a lot of theories. But the fact that I know so far is this particular aircraft, this specific tail, AI171, has a clean history,\" Mr Chandrasekaran said, cautioning people against jumping to conclusions.\n\"I am told by all the experts that the black box and recorders will definitely tell the story. So, we just have to wait for that,\" he added.\nKishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, told the BBC that the condition of an aircraft engine is not necessarily linked to its age - particularly in the case of the Genx-1B engines used on the Boeing 787-8.\n\"The age of the engine has no bearing on the health of the engine, especially for the Genx-1B engines,\" Mr Chinta said. In other words just because an engine is new, does not necessarily mean it is healthy, or vice versa. \nUnlike older models, the Genx-1B engines, which are made by GE Aerospace, don't follow a fixed overhaul or maintenance schedule. Instead, they are equipped with a system called the Full Authority Digital Engine Control or FADEC that continuously monitors engine health and performance. The decision to service or replace the engine is based on this data and physical inspections.\nHowever, Mr Chinta pointed out that certain components of the engine, known as Life Limited Parts (LLPs), still have a fixed lifespan typically between 15,000 and 20,000 cycles.\n\"Every start and switch-off of the engine counts as one cycle,\" he explained.\nWhile the investigation continues, Air India has also announced a 15% cut in its international operations on wide-body aircraft until mid-July as it grapples with the fallout from the crash.\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the decision was driven by \"compounding circumstances\" - including enhanced safety checks, increased caution by crew and ground staff and tensions in the Middle East.\nSeparately, the airline said that inspections have been completed on 26 of its 33 Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft, all of which have been \"cleared for service\". \nIndia's aviation regulator had ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet after the deadly crash as a \"preventive measure\".\nThe remaining aircraft are expected to be examined in the coming days, Air India said, adding that the airline's Boeing 777 fleet would also \"undertake enhanced safety checks\".\n\"The curtailments are a painful measure to take, but are necessary following a devastating event which we are still working through and an unusual combination of external events,\" it said. \nMeanwhile some experts say the crash will likely have an impact on Air India as it tries to transform from a troubled state-owned carrier to a privately-owned company. \nTata Sons, a conglomerate which also owns big brands like Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover, brought the airline - formerly India's national carrier - from the Indian government in 2022. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "India's Smriti Mandhana is the number one ranked batter in ODIs, with Nat Sciver-Brunt third\nEngland's new era under head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt started with a ruthless clean sweep against the West Indies, but their first real challenge begins on Saturday, with the first of five T20s against India taking place at Trent Bridge. \nThey are followed by three one-day internationals, which will be hugely important in preparation for the World Cup which is being hosted by India in the autumn. \nSuch is the anticipation for the series, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) commissioned 'Bend it Like Beckham' director Gurinder Chadha to direct a promotional trailer for the ongoing men's, women's and mixed disability series in which India face England in all three.\nIndia are ranked third in the world in both white-ball formats with England in second, and the introduction of the Women's Premier League (WPL) has significantly improved their strength in depth and experience of playing in front of packed crowds under pressure. \nBBC Sport looks at the players to watch and the storylines to keep an eye out for.\nSciver-Brunt and India batter Smriti Mandhana are two of the game's biggest icons - at the first auction for the WPL in 2023, the England all-rounder sold for about \u00a3320,000 and the elegant India left-hander was the most expensive pick at \u00a3340,000.\nMandhana is the world's top-ranked batter in ODIs with Sciver-Brunt in third, while they are fourth and ninth in T20s respectively. \nTheir individual successes could go a long way in defining the series. England win 79% of their ODIs if Sciver-Brunt passes 50, and that figure rises to 82% in T20s.\nIndia rely a little more on Mandhana in the longer format with a win percentage of 76% if she scores a half-century, compared to 60% in T20s. \nIn general, India are likely to present a bigger challenge to England with the bat as their bowling looks depleted without the experience and prolific swing of the injured Renuka Singh Thakur.\nIn their warm-ups, they have conceded 353-5 to England's Select XI in a 50-over match and 194-8 in the T20, eventually losing both.\nMandhana, named Wisden's leading women's cricketer in the world for 2024, has an excellent record against England, averaging 51.68 in ODIs and a fraction over 38 in T20s, but there are areas of weakness for the bowlers to target.\nIn T20s, England's seamers should target Mandhana on the stumps early in her innings with movement into the left-hander - she averages 23 against in-swing compared to 40 against balls that swing away from her. \nCharlie Dean and Alice Capsey should also take note as off-spin is the best match-up to Mandhana. Since 2022, she averages 24 with a strike-rate of 108 - her lowest average and strike-rate against any type of bowling. \nSophie Ecclestone took 4-12 as Lancashire won the T20 Women's County Cup final\nThe return of Ecclestone, the world's number one bowler in ODIs and ranked fourth in T20s, has dominated the build-up to the series as she returns to the England fold for the first time since the Ashes. \nThe left-arm spinner made headlines for her off-field behaviour in Australia when she refused a TV interview with former team-mate turned pundit Alex Hartley, who had criticised the team's fitness after the T20 World Cup.\nShe was then left out of Edwards' first squads for the West Indies series, having missed the start of Lancashire's season with a knee injury. England insisted her absence was due to a lack of game time and to recover from the niggle, though Ecclestone played for her county on the same day the squad was announced.\nIt was confirmed at the beginning of this month that Ecclestone would take a break from county cricket to \"prioritise her wellbeing\" and to manage a quad problem, before Edwards named her in the squad to face India. \n\"This is the best preparation for Sophie, to be ready for India,\" Edwards said after the final ODI against West Indies, when asked about her previous statements that she wanted to pick players based on form in domestic cricket. \n\"She has been playing, she has performed really well, including winning the T20 Cup with Lancashire, so I'm happy with how she is tracking.\" \nDespite a difficult period for England, Ecclestone's numbers have never dropped - in 2024 she took 24 wickets in T20s, averaging 14.87 with an economy rate of just 5.59, and 13 scalps in ODIs at a remarkable average of 7.23.\nBut with fellow left-armer Smith impressing against West Indies, including a five-for on ODI debut - alongside Edwards' insistence that nobody's place in the side is guaranteed - it is unlikely Ecclestone has ever been under pressure like this before.\nOne of England's most significant weaknesses over the past couple of years has been their ability against spin, and an apparent lack of strategy against it. \nThough West Indies' bowling line-up was unthreatening and England's batters dominated throughout, there were some suggestions this is still a concern and will be tested both in this upcoming series, and more significantly in the World Cup where conditions will suit the spinners.\nIn the T20s, West Indies opened with Zaida James' spin and she removed Danni Wyatt-Hodge twice with the first ball of the match, while Hayley Matthews took 3-32 in the third T20 and 2-49 in the first ODI. \nThough England drew the 2023 Ashes at home, 23 wickets fell to off-spinner Ash Gardner and a surprise T20 series defeat by Sri Lanka followed as the tourists wisely packed their side with slow bowlers. \nLeg-spinner Alana King then matched Gardner's tally at the start of this year as England lost 40 wickets to spin in the series at an average of just 12.3. \nThere is no doubt India will be aware of this and it works to their advantage, too - since 2023, 58% of their deliveries bowled in both white-ball formats have been from spinners, and they have accounted for 62% of their wickets in T20s and 65% in ODIs.\nDeepti Sharma's run out of Charlie Dean sealed a 3-0 ODI series win for India in 2022\nIndia's last tour of England in 2022 saw the visitors claim a 3-0 clean sweep in the ODIs, with Sciver-Brunt and then-captain Heather Knight's absences sorely felt, but it was the final act of the series at Lord's which saw it end in controversy. \nIn a thrilling finale, England needed 17 runs to win while India required just one wicket when spinner Deepti Sharma ran out Dean on 47 at the non-striker's end - often referred to as a 'Mankad'. \nDean was in tears, stand-in captain Amy Jones said she was \"not a fan\" while India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur backed her bowler. \nDean jokingly re-enacted the dismissal in a game for Southern Vipers the following day and the pair have since played together for London Spirit, winning The Hundred last year.\nBut at Lord's on 19 July, their reunion will inevitably take the spotlight. \n\"It's in the laws, it happens, so unless the laws change and become a little bit more obvious in terms of what counts and what doesn't, then it's going to keep happening,\" said England batter Tammy Beaumont. \n\"We have to get on board with that unfortunately. I'm sure externally there will be plenty of replays but we'll be keeping our bats behind the line for sure.\n\"We'll play in a competitive spirit as we always do against India, but definitely we will be respectful to all their players too.\"\nFollow ball by ball commentary of every match of India's tour of England on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app. TV highlights will be available on iPlayer and the Red Button.",

PTIThe jet has been towed away to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at Thiruvananthapuram airportSince the jet's landing, engineers from HMS Prince of Wales had assessed the aircraft, but they were unable to fix it.On Sunday, the British High Commission said in a statement that a team of engineers from UK was \"deployed to Thiruvananthapuram airport to assess and repair the F-35B aircraft\".It said the team was \"carrying specialist equipment necessary for the movement and repair process\".The curious case of the British jet stuck in IndiaVideo footage shared by Indian news agencies ANI and PTI showed a British Royal Air Force Airbus landing at Thiruvananthapuram to drop the team of technical experts.Videos showed the F-35B being towed away to a hangar - the high commission had earlier said they had \"accepted the offer to move the craft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility\", but were waiting for equipment to arrive from the UK.F-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability.The $110m (\u00a380m) jet is being guarded around the clock by six officers from the RAF. The case of the stranded jet has also been raised in the House of Commons.In India, images of the \"lonely F-35B\", parked on the tarmac and soaked by the Kerala monsoon rains, have made it a subject jokes and memes with many suggesting that it does not want to leave the scenic state of Kerala, described as \"God's own country\" in tourism brochures.Experts say if the team of engineers is unable to repair the aircraft and make it fly worthy, it will have to be dismantled and carried out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.Royal NavyRoyal Air ForceIndia",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture.

Everything feels extravagant, emotional and larger than life.\nNow imagine all of that without the bride and groom. No pheras (a Hindu marriage ritual where the couple takes seven rounds around a sacred fire), no relatives, no tearful farewells. Just the party.\nWelcome to the world of fake weddings - a rising trend in Indian cities where people gather to enjoy the wedding party, minus the actual marriage. \nThese ticketed events, organised by hotels, clubs and companies, are designed purely for fun and promise to offer the full experience of a wedding party without any stress, rituals or responsibilities. Simply put, it's a wedding-themed party night.\nOver the past few weeks, fake weddings have been making a splash in big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The attendees are usually young people looking to enjoy a night out with friends, indulging in the drama and fun of a traditional Indian wedding without the attendant pressures.\nLast week, we attended one such curated event in Delhi - a fake sangeet (a sangeet is a night of music and dance usually held a few days before the wedding).\nAt the event, held at a plush club, the vibe was electric: women twirled in sequinned saris and lehengas (long skirts and blouses), men showed up in tailored kurtas and ethnic jackets. A traditional dhol drummer led the crowd to the dance floor and tequila-filled gol gappas (a popular Indian street snack) made the rounds.\nShivangi Sareen, who attended an event like this for the first time, found it \"amazing\".\n\"At family weddings, there's so much pressure - the rules around dressing up, the judgement [from relatives]. But here, it's just fun,\" she said. \"Especially because we got to do it all with our friends. We decided our outfits the day before and got ready together.\"\nTicket prices typically start at around 1,500 rupees ($17; \u00a313) and can go up to 15,000 rupees or more, depending on the venue and facilities. Shivangi and her friends paid 10,000 rupees per couple to attend.\n\"I wouldn't mind spending this once a month. The whole experience was totally worth it.\"\nSharad Madan, owner of a restaurant which hosted the event, says the trend underscores that novelty is key in the hospitality sector.\n\"We have to keep doing something new for our patrons,\" he said.\nIt cost them around a million rupees to plan and organise the event, Mr Madan says, and the team expected to make double that through ticket sales. But it's not just about profits, he says.\n\"It's about engagement. Even if it doesn't give me the same kind of returns, I would still do it because our patrons want something different.\"\nKaushal Chanani, co-founder of 8Club events which hosted a fake wedding party attended by 2,000 people in Bengaluru last month, says that the inspiration for fake weddings came from young Indians living abroad.\n\"People from the diaspora would gather and dance to Bollywood music, dress in ethnic [traditional] clothes and enjoy the evening,\" he said. \"This is the idea we followed as well.\"\nThe response to the Bengaluru event, held at a five-star hotel, was \"overwhelming\", he says. It encouraged them to plan a similar event in Delhi - which was sold out - and they started getting queries from event organisers in other cities such as Jaipur, Kolkata and Lucknow.\n\"We now give out our standard operating procedure (SOP) to people who are interested,\" he says. \"It is a guide on how to create the experience, market it and make it profitable.\"\nHowever, not all fake weddings follow the same script.\nThird Place, an experience-based start-up, recently hosted a sober sangeet in Bengaluru - no alcohol, just a themed celebration.\n\"We divided attendees into groom and bride's teams and organised games like charades and guessing who the relative is from a stereotype,\" said CEO Anurag Pandey.\nThere were dhol drums, a grand welcome for all guests and even astrology-themed games. Alcohol was deliberately left out.\n\"Sometimes booze takes away from the experience,\" Mr Pandey said. \"We wanted to do more than just a pub night or a regular takeover. We wanted to showcase the spirit of Indian weddings.\"\nCommentators say the popularity of these events reflects young people's growing desire to find reasons to celebrate.\n\"People need a hook of some kind\u2026 an occasion to celebrate. And there's no better setting than a wedding, which brings together all the elements of fun,\" says writer and social commentator Santosh Desai.\n\"It's the pinnacle of enjoyment - especially when it's free from the stress that accompanies real weddings.\"\nHe also points out that these events give people a reason to re-wear expensive wedding outfits bought in the past.\nSo, are such events here to stay?\nEvent planner Vijay Arora, founder of Delhi-based Touchwood Events, believes fake weddings are currently a fad - but one with potential.\n\"Gen Z definitely wants to be part of such celebrations,\" he said.\n\"If it emerges as a new market category then it can be a major game changer since the scale will increase - which eventually amps up business opportunities for the entire industry.\"\nIndia's wedding industry is estimated to be worth around $130bn, according to investment advisory firm Wright Research.\nWhile the sector is booming, there are constraints. Most weddings take place during the cooler months - typically between November and March - and often at auspicious times, while the monsoon season (June to August) is considered off-season.\nWith venues free, vendors available and people constantly chasing experiences, fake weddings could step in to fill the gap if the trend holds.\nMr Arora says he was surprised by the rise of fake weddings.\n\"But it also helps in understanding that such events are something that we want to celebrate or be a part of. Even if we can't attend the real events our friends or family host, we still want to experience them by joining these fake ones.\"\nHowever, not every guest walks away thrilled.\nSrishti Sharma, a 23-year-old Bengaluru-based marketing professional, said she was underwhelmed by the only fake wedding she attended.\n\"I've lived away from home for a few years now and I really missed attending a wedding,\" she said.\n\"The biggest plus was not having nagging relatives telling you 'you're next in line to get married'.\"\nMs Sharma and her friends spent hours picking outfits, but the event fell short.\n\"They began with EDM and switched to Bollywood only after two hours,\" she said.\n\"We expected wedding food but got pizza and fries - no dessert, just alcohol. The decor was basic and felt lazy.\"\nSome have criticised the events, saying they could come across as trivialising traditional Indian events and values.\nBut Vidhi Kapoor, who attended the fake sangeet in Delhi, disagrees.\n\"It might have been offensive had people been asked to dress up like a bride or groom but here it's just a party, we should take it in high spirits,\" she said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "For weeks, a battle over language and identity has been raging in India's richest state, Maharashtra.\nThe row began in April after the Maharashtra government made it compulsory for state-run primary schools to teach Hindi as a third language, apart from English and Marathi (the state's dominant language). This, it said, was in line with a federal policy which mandates that children be taught three languages in school.\nThe National Education Policy (NEP), introduced in 1968, aims to promote and regulate education in India and the government updates it occasionally. The latest iteration of the policy, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government five years ago, is being implemented in stages and has run into controversy earlier. \nThe Maharashtra government's decision met fierce opposition from civil society groups, language activists and opposition leaders who accused it of trying to impose Hindi - predominantly spoken in northern and central Indian states - in the state.\nLanguage is a sensitive issue in India where many states, including Maharashtra, were formed on linguistic lines after independence. The local language is often intrinsically linked to regional pride and identity, and any change to the status quo can be perceived as a threat. For instance, last year, Kannada-language activists in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, held protests demanding that billboards be written in the local language and not just English.\nBut the uneasiness is especially high when it comes to Hindi, the most-spoken language in India. Over the years, steps by various federal governments to promote Hindi have fuelled fears within non-Hindi speaking states that the local culture will be diluted. These worries have been exacerbated by high migration from less-developed Hindi-speaking states to other parts of India, especially the south, in search of jobs.\nAbhay Deshpande, a political analyst, says that these anxieties have increased after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. Top leaders of the BJP - the party is stronger in Hindi-speaking states - have often courted controversy by making remarks about privileging Hindi.\nAs tensions rose in Maharashtra, the state government - ruled by a BJP-led coalition - revoked its decision and appointed a committee to re-examine the three-language policy. But the controversy refuses to die down.\nThe row comes months ahead of the long-overdue municipal polls which are set to be held in the state, including in Mumbai city, home to India's richest municipal corporation. It has sparked a political slugfest between the ruling coalition and opposition parties, with each side accusing the other of playing political games. \nThere have also been reports of violence against non-Marathi speakers in the state.\nIn April, two women in Thane district were allegedly assaulted in their residential complex after they said \"excuse me\" to a man who insisted they speak to him in Marathi.\nThe same month, a security guard in Mumbai was allegedly beaten up by workers from the opposition Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) - a nativist party known for its aggressive brand of politics - after he said that he did not know Marathi.\nIn May, a couple in Mumbai reportedly refused to pay a delivery agent after he declined to speak in Marathi. Last week, a shocking video showing a shop owner being assaulted, allegedly by MNS workers, for not speaking Marathi went viral on social media, sparking outrage.\nWhile the issue seems to have increased societal divisions, it has also brought together two political rivals almost two decades after they parted ways.\nLast week, Uddhav Thackeray, chief of the local opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party and Raj Thackeray, leader of the MNS - the son and nephew, respectively, of Bal Thackeray, patriarch of the erstwhile Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party that gained popularity in Maharashtra in the 1960s with its nativist politics - held a joint rally to oppose alleged Hindi imposition.\nWhile the strength of the truce remains to be seen, experts say that the optics of the cousins putting aside differences to \"protect Marathi pride\" could help their prospects in the upcoming municipal elections.\n\"The issue of Marathi language and culture is close to peoples' hearts,\" says Prashant Dixit, a former political journalist who has reported on the state for over two decades. \"It is an emotive issue, especially for people living in Mumbai, and it has been so since the 1960s,\" he adds.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the erstwhile Shiv Sena, under the leadership of Bal Thackeray, conducted aggressive campaigns against people who had migrated to Mumbai from southern states, accusing them of taking up jobs that should have gone to locals.\nIn the decades after that, migration patterns changed and the party turned its ire towards people from northern states who were migrating to the city in search of economic opportunities. The party blamed migrants from states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for taking away jobs. \nThese tensions look set to continue. According to data from India's last census, there was a 40% increase in Mumbai city's Hindi-speaking population between 2001 and 2011.\nThese Marathi-centric agitations have earlier resonated with voters, especially in Mumbai, and some believe that it could help the Thackeray cousins in the municipal elections as well.  \nHowever, many have criticised this approach.\nAn editorial in the Indian Express newspaper titled 'Slap In Mumbai's Face' argued that politics centred around linguistic identity was \"deeply troubling\" and that its parochialism lent itself to violence, something that \"should have no place in India's most industrialised state\". \nMr Dixit agrees - he thinks that any support garnered by aggressive language agitations is likely to be short-lived. \n\"People want their leaders to deliver on their promises and focus on real progress, in the form of better jobs and policies, so that life is better for everyone,\" he says.",

Row over language turns violent in India's richest state19 hours agoShareSaveCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiShareSaveEPA/ShutterstockPolice in Mumbai detain a woman who was participating in a protest this week against alleged injustice to Marathi speakersFor weeks, a battle over language and identity has been raging in India's richest state, Maharashtra.The row began in April after the Maharashtra government made it compulsory for state-run primary schools to teach Hindi as a third language, apart from English and Marathi (the state's dominant language). For instance, last year, Kannada-language activists in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, held protests demanding that billboards be written in the local language and not just English.But the uneasiness is especially high when it comes to Hindi, the most-spoken language in India. The Maharashtra government's decision met fierce opposition from civil society groups, language activists and opposition leaders who accused it of trying to impose Hindi - predominantly spoken in northern and central Indian states - in the state.Language is a sensitive issue in India where many states, including Maharashtra, were formed on linguistic lines after independence.",

        "article_text": "When the preliminary report into the crash of Air India Flight 171 - which killed 260 people in June - was released, many hoped it would bring some measure of closure.\nInstead, the 15-page report added fuel to a firestorm of speculation. For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.\nSeconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.\nSeveral speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. \nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Reuters news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". \nItalian newspaper Corriere della Sera claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".\nSumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.\nUnderstandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.\nLast week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through selective and unverified reporting\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".\nJennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were \"premature and speculative\" and that investigations of this magnitude take time\".  \nBack in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. \nSam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.\nAt the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. \nA Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents at several possibilities.\nFor example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. \n\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.\n\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".\n\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"\nInvestigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". \nA glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.\nHowever, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.\nSpeculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.\nThe preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. \nThis selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?\nPeter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.\n\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"\nInvestigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.\n\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.\nAt the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. \nIndian newspapers includig the Indian Express flagged a possible electrical fire in the tail as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.\nLast week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".\n\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\". He also pledged to share updates on \"technical or public interest matters\" as they arise.\nSumming up, Mr Pruchnicki said the probe \"boils down to two possibilities - either deliberate action or confusion, or an automation-related issue\".\n\"The report doesn't rush to blame human error or intent; there's no proof it was done intentionally,\" he added.\nIn other words, no smoking gun - just an uneasy wait for answers that may never even fully emerge.",

        "article_text": "A state-of-the-art British fighter jet stuck at an airport in India for nearly three weeks now has sparked curiosity and raised questions about how such a modern aircraft could get stranded for days in a foreign country.\nThe F-35B landed at Thiruvananthapuram airport in the southern state of Kerala on 14 June.\nThe aircraft was diverted there after it ran into bad weather during a sortie in the Indian ocean and was unable to return to HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's flagship carrier.\nIt landed safely but it has since developed a technical snag and is unable to return to the carrier.\nSince the jet's landing, engineers from HMS Prince of Wales have assessed the aircraft, but the visiting teams have been unable to fix it so far.\nOn Thursday, the British High Commission said in a statement to the BBC: \"The UK has accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at the airport. It will be moved to the hangar once UK engineering teams arrive with specialist equipment, thereby ensuring there is minimal disruption to scheduled maintenance of other aircraft.\n\"The aircraft will return to active service once repairs and safety checks have been completed,\" it added. \"Ground teams continue to work closely with Indian authorities to ensure safety and security precautions are observed.\" \nAuthorities at Thiruvananthapuram airport told the BBC they were expecting technicians from the UK to arrive on Saturday.\nThe $110m (\u00a380m) jet is being guarded around the clock by six officers from the RAF.\nDr Sameer Patil, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai, told the BBC the Royal Navy had only two options: \"They can repair it and make it fly-worthy or they can fly it out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.\"\nThe case of the stranded jet has also been raised in the House of Commons. \nOn Monday, opposition Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty asked the government to clarify what was being done to secure it and return it to operational service, the UK Defence Journal reported. \n\"What steps are the government taking to recover the plane, how much longer will that take, and how will the government ensure the security of protected technologies on the jet while it is in the hangar and out of view?\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe British armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, confirmed the aircraft remained under close UK control.\n\"We continue to work with our Indian friends who provided first-class support when the F-35B was unable to return to the carrier,\" he said. \"I am certain that the security of the jet is in good hands because Royal Air Force crew are with it at all times.\"\nF-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability. \nSo images of the \"lonely F-35B\", parked on the tarmac and soaked by the Kerala monsoon rains, have spawned memes on social media.\nOne viral post joked that the jet had been put up for sale at an online site at a hugely competitive price of $4m. The listing claimed the jet included features like \"automatic parking, brand-new tyres, a new battery and an automatic gun to destroy traffic violators\".\nOne user on X said the jet deserved Indian citizenship as it had been in the country long enough, while another suggested that India should start charging rent and that the Kohinoor diamond would be the most appropriate payment.\nOn Wednesday, Kerala government's tourism department also joined in the fun with a post on X that said \"Kerala, the destination you'll never want to leave.\"\nThe post included an AI-generated photograph of an F-35B standing on the runway with coconut palm trees in the background. The text suggested that, like most visitors to the state described in tourism brochures as \"God's own country\" for its scenic beauty, the jet too was finding it hard to leave.\nDr Patil says that each passing day that the jet remains stranded, \"it adversely affects the image of the F-35Bs and the Royal Navy\".\n\"The jokes and memes and rumours and conspiracy theories are affecting the image and credibility of the British Royal Navy. The longer the jet stays stranded, the more disinformation will come out.\" \nThe engineering issues \"seem of a much more serious nature\" than it was originally thought, he says.\nBut most militaries, he adds, prepare for \"a worst-case scenario\" - and it is one since a jet is stranded on foreign soil. \n\"Most militaries would have a standard operating procedure [SOP] on how to respond when something like this happens. So does the Royal Navy not have an SOP?\"\nThe optics of this, he says, are really bad. \n\"If such a thing had happened in enemy territory, would they have taken this much time?

        "article_text": "India's showpiece software industry is facing a moment of reckoning.\nThe country's biggest private sector employer Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - also its largest IT services company - has announced it will cut more than 12,000 jobs at middle and senior management levels. This will reduce the firm's workforce by 2%.\nThe Mumbai-headquartered software behemoth employs over half-a-million IT workers and is considered a bellwether for business sentiment across India's $283bn software industry. It forms the backbone of formal, white-collar employment in the country.\nThe decision, TCS says, was taken to make the company \"future ready\" as it invests in new areas and deploys artificial intelligence at scale amid seismic disruptions in its traditional business model.\nCompanies like TCS have, for decades, relied on cheap skilled labour to produce software for global clients at lower costs, but this has been upended by AI automating tasks and clients demanding more innovative solutions, rather than just cost savings on manpower.\n\"A number of re-skilling and redeployment initiatives have been under way,\" TCS said in a statement, adding it will be \"releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible\".\n\"Across IT companies, people managers are being let go while the doers are being kept to rationalise the workforce and bring in efficiencies,\"  Neeti Sharma, CEO of staffing firm TeamLease Digital told the BBC. \nShe added that \"there's been a massive spike\" in emerging tech hiring in areas such as AI, cloud, data security, but it is not at the same intensity at which people are being fired.\nTCS's announcement also highlights the sharp \"skills mismatch\" in the country's software industry, experts say.\nAs generative AI leads to a rapid enhancement of productivity, \"this technology shift is forcing businesses to reassess their workforce structure and analyse if resources should be redirected toward roles that complement AI capabilities,\" Rishi Shah, economist with Grant Thornton Bharat told the BBC.\nAccording to the industry body Nasscom, India needs a million AI professionals by 2026, but not even 20% of the country's IT professionals are AI-skilled. \nWhile up-skilling spends by tech companies have significantly spiked as they rush to prepare a new pool of AI talent for the future, those without the requisite skills are being shown the door. \nBesides the structural shifts brought about by the advent of AI, TCS's announcement also \"reflects the broader growth challenges being faced by India's IT sector\", according to global investment banking firm Jeffries.\n\"Aggregate net hiring at industry level has been weak since FY22 [financial year 2022], mainly due to the prolonged moderation in demand outlook,\" Jeffries said in a note.\nDemand for IT services in the US \u2013 which contributes to half of the revenue for Indian software majors - has been impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs.\nWhile tariffs chiefly target physical goods, analysts say companies are pausing on discretionary IT spending as they reconsider the economic impact of tariff uncertainties and their global sourcing strategies.\nRising AI adoption is also driving US companies to negotiate lower costs, forcing people heavy IT firms to work with fewer employees, according to Jeffries.\nThe ripple effects of this have begun to be felt in cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune \u2013 once epicentres of India's IT boom. Some 50,000 people in the industry lost their jobs last year, according to one estimate. And there was a 72% drop in net employee additions at India's top six IT services companies.\nAll of this could have cascading effects on India's broader economy, which has struggled to create jobs for the millions of young graduates that enter the workforce every year.\nIn the absence of a strong manufacturing sector, these software companies - which made India the world's back office in the 1990s - were the preferred employment option for hundreds of thousands of new IT workers. They birthed a new, affluent middle class, spawning growth in many cities and fueling demand for cars and homes.\nBut as stable, well-paying jobs shrink, there are now questions over India's services-led economic boom.\nUntil just a few years ago, India's IT majors would absorb 600,000 fresh graduates every year. In the last two years, that number has dramatically fallen to about 150,000, according to TeamLease Digital.\nOther emerging sectors such as financial technology startups and GCCs (global capability centres) \u2013 which are off-shore units of multinational companies that perform supporting tasks like IT, finance or research and development - are absorbing the rest, but at least \"20-25% of fresh graduates will have no jobs,\" says Ms Sharma.\nShe adds that the \"GCCs will never match the volume of hiring that the IT companies did\".\nSeveral top business leaders in India have begun flagging the economic consequences of these trends.\nIndia's trimmed down IT sector could \"negatively impact many allied services and industries, crash real estate and give a big blow to premium consumption,\" D Muthukrishnan, one of south India's largest distributor of mutual-funds wrote on X, reacting to TCS's announcement. \nA few months ago Arindam Paul, entrepreneur and founder of the motor technology company Atomberg, warned of the potentially crippling impact of AI on India's middle class in a LinkedIn post. \n\"Almost 40-50% white collar jobs that exist today might cease to exist,\" Paul wrote. \"And that would mean the end of the middle class and the consumption story.\" \nHow quickly Indian tech giants adapt to the gamut of disruptions being brought by the AI revolution will decide whether the country can retain its edge as a global technology player. And whether it can expand its consuming middle-class that can keep its GDP growth on track.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

He spent nearly eight days there.\nThe Ax-4 team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. They will also be taking their countries back to space after four decades.\nA collaboration between Nasa, Isro and the European Space Agency (Esa), Wednesday's flight by Houston-based private company Axiom Space will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket. \nGroup Captain Shukla's inclusion in the mission has generated a huge amount of interest in India and posters of the astronaut have come up in his home city Lucknow. \nDuring their two-week mission, Axiom Space says, the crew would spend most of their time conducting 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nAs he heads into space, Group Captain Shukla says, \"I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.\"\nHowever, some of the other items in his bag will be more tangible.\nThe Indian astronaut has said he would be carrying into space some of his favourite sweets especially-prepared for the mission.\n\"There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halva and moong dal [lentil] halva with me,\" he said at a press conference earlier this month, promising to share the goodies with his fellow astronauts.\nThe calorie-laden sweets, however, will pose no threat to his fitness, according to his sister Shuchi Shukla.\n\"He is a fitness-freak and highly into yoga so I am sure he will balance it,\" she told The Hindustan Times newspaper.\nAt the online press conference, the astronauts, who have been in quarantine to prepare for the trip, showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be \"the fifth crew member\" on Ax-4.\nAccording to Axiom, Joy will be \"more than a cute companion for the Ax-4 crew\" and will travel to space as their \"zero-G [zero-gravity] indicator\".\n\"It will be used as an indicator by the crew, shortly after launch, as a physical confirmation that they have transitioned to microgravity.\"\nUnveiling the five-inch-tall toy, Commander Whitson said the swan, known for its grace and elegance, was chosen for its cultural significance in the countries represented by the crew.\n\"In India, it symbolises wisdom and purity, representing the pursuit of truth. In Poland, the swan stands for purity, loyalty and resilience, while in Hungary, it epitomises loyalty, grace and the beauty of nature.\"\nGroup Captain Shukla added that in Indian culture, a swan is also the vehicle of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning and wisdom.\n\"To carry the swan to space is to carry the pursuit of knowledge, clarity of purpose and grace under pressure,\" he said.\nAxiom Space says Joy was chosen after the crew considered a number of animals, including dinosaurs and lions. The swan's name was proposed by the Hungarian astronaut Kapu. \"A team that has joy is a team that is healthy,\" he said at the press conference.\nGroup Captain Shukla has described astronaut Rakesh Sharma, India's first man in space, as his hero.\nSharma flew to space aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984 and spent nearly eight days orbiting Earth.\nGroup Captain Shukla, who was born a year later in 1985, says: \"I grew up reading about him in textbooks and listening to his stories. I was deeply, deeply impressed by him.\"\nHe's described Mr Sharma as a \"kind of a mentor for me, who is advising me on a lot of things, including how to prepare for this mission\".\nAt the press conference, he revealed that he was carrying something up to the ISS for his mentor and that he would present it to him once he returns.\nHe refused to divulge what the souvenir would be and said \"it will be a surprise\".\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Its crew included Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to have gone to space.\nHis trip came 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma flew aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - was a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. \nOn Monday, ISS posted on X that the Ax-4 crew had taken their places in the spacecraft and its hatches had been closed. The undocking of the craft - when it separated from the ISS - was broadcast live. \nOn Tuesday morning, Axiom Space said the craft would announce its arrival with a brief sonic boom before splashing down in the ocean off the coast of California, after which a vessel would pick it up. The crew would then be flown out to land in a helicopter.\nIn his farewell address from aboard the ISS on Sunday, the Indian astronaut said India's journey in space exploration may be tough, but it has begun.\n\"It has been an incredible journey. Even though now it is coming to an end, for you and me there is a long way to go. The journey of our human space mission is very long and difficult. But if we are determined, even the stars are attainable.\"\nHe referred to India's first man in space cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma famously quoting from a 1924 Urdu song \"Sare jahan se achcha\" to say \"India looked better than the rest of the world\".\n\"Even today we want to know how it looks from space. I'll tell you. From space, today's India looks ambitious. It looks fearless. It looks confident. It looks proud. And so, I can once again say that today's India still looks better than the rest of the world,\" Group Captain Shukla said. \nAx-4, which was originally expected to spend two weeks on the ISS, ended up staying a few days longer.

        "article_text": "Fuel to the engines of the Air India plane involved in a deadly crash was cut off moments after takeoff, a preliminary report has found.\nIn recovered cockpit voice recordings, the report said one of the pilots can be heard asking \"why did you cut off?\" - to which the other pilot replied he \"did not do so\".\nThe London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed less than a minute after taking off on 12 June from Ahmedabad airport in western India, killing 260 people, most of them passengers. One British national miraculously survived the crash. \nAn investigation led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is ongoing, with a final, more detailed report expected in 12 months.\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, both of the plane's fuel control switches moved from the run to the cutoff position in the space of a second, shortly after takeoff.\nThe switches are usually only cut off to turn off the engines after landing, or during emergency situations such as an engine fire - rather than during takeoff.\nThe cutoff caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report said.\nThere is then confusion heard in the cockpit, with one pilot asking the other why they had switched off the fuel, which the other denied. The Gatwick-bound plane was being piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar. The report does not specify which voice is which.\nThe fuel switches then moved back into their normal inflight position, automatically starting the process of relighting the engines. One engine, the report said, was able to regain thrust - but could not reverse the plane's deceleration. \nOne of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane plummeted and crashed into a building used as doctors' accommodation, causing an explosion.\nBoth pilots had an \"adequate rest period prior\" to the flight, the report said.\nExperts had previously speculated that birds could have caused the crash, but the report said that \"no significant bird activity\" was observed in the vicinity of the plane's flight path.\nThe report said: \"At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers\".\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin in 2019 highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged, the report said.\nThe issue was not deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation.\nThe same switch design is used in Air India's VT-ANB aircraft which crashed. As the bulletin was advisory, Air India did not perform inspections. \nThere had been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB, the report said.\nExperts who spoke to the BBC offered differing opinions on whether this could have played a factor.\nAn Air India spokesperson said the airline acknowledged receipt of the preliminary report.\n\"We continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB,\" the Air India spokesperson added.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it would defer to AAIB to provide information about the crashed plane, in adherence with protocol under the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It also said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board in a statement thanked Indian officials for their cooperation and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing-787 jets or the GE engines.\nWhile no conclusions are drawn and the report notes that investigations are ongoing, the focus appears to be on the actions of the pilots.\nThe preliminary investigation into the crash - one of the worst in recent aviation history - was led by the AAIB, with inputs from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India, and aviation regulators from India, the UK and the US.\nUnder ICAO rules, preliminary reports should be filed within 30 days of a crash, although it isn't mandatory to make them public. \nThe accident marked the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner suffered a fatal crash since entering service in 2011.\nIn the days following the crash, the aircraft's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or \"black boxes\" - were recovered from the debris, a crucial breakthrough for investigators looking to reconstruct the flight's final moments.\nThese devices capture extensive flight data and cockpit audio - from pilot radio calls to ambient cockpit sounds.\nThe crash is a major setback for Air India, which is in the middle of a business turnaround following its privatisation. It was bought out by the Tata Group from the Indian government in 2022.\nThe airline has announced a cut in international operations on its wide-body aircraft as it grapples with several disruptions in the aftermath of the crash.\nThe tragedy has also put the spotlight on aviation safety in India.\nEarlier this month, India's civil aviation regulator completed enhanced safety checks on 26 out of Air India's 33 Dreamliners without finding major concerns.\nSpeaking to the BBC this week, the chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - India's aviation safety regulator - defended the country's record, saying that between 2010 and 2024 it consistently performed better than the world average when it came to the number of accidents annually, except for in two years in which major accidents happened.\nHowever, there have been a number of disquieting reports in recent weeks, highlighting maintenance oversights and training shortfalls.",

        "article_text": "A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them.\nPrada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing a toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. \nAs the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a \"dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans\". \nOver the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. \nPrada told the BBC that it held a \"successful meeting\" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group.\nThe statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear.\nWhile it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on.\nMany big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source.\nEarlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M ignited a fiery debate on cultural appropriation after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection.\nAnd just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all.\nThe BBC has reached out to Dior for comment.\nSome experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale.\nIn the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices.\nBut critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices.\n\"Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,\" says Shefalee Vasudev, the editor-in-chief of Voice of Fashion. Not doing so, she adds, is \"cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love\".\nEstimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity.\nAnalysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India is expected to nearly double to $14bn by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere.\nBut not everyone shares the optimism.\nArvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion.\nIn recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall.\n\"Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,\" Mr Singhal says. \n\"And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether.\"\nAnand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments.\n\"But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,\" he adds.\nThe frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years.\nThe most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld \"Paris-Bombay\" M\u00e9tiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces.\nMany called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clich\u00e9d imagery and lacked authentic representation of India.\nOthers, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant.\n\"We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,\" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury.\nIn the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a \"genuine oversight\", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. \nFor Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens.\n\"The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,\" she says.\n\"But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine.\"\nThe question of cultural appropriation is complex, and the debates it sparks online can seem both overblown and eye-opening.\nAnd while there are no simple answers, many feel the outrage around Prada has been a great starting point to demand better accountability from brands and designers who, until now, have largely remained unchallenged.\nIt is an opportunity for India, too, to reflect on the ways it can support its own heritage and uplift it. \nWeavers toil for weeks or months to finish one masterpiece, but they often work in precarious conditions without adequate remuneration and with no protection for their work under international intellectual property laws.\n\"We don't take enough pride and credit our own artisans, allowing others to walk all over it,\" Ms Vasudev says.\n\"The trouble also is that in India we have simply too much. There are hundreds of different craft techniques and traditions - each with its constantly evolving motif directory going back centuries,\" says Laila Tyabji, chairperson of Dastkar, which promotes crafts and craftspeople.\n\"We bargain and bicker over a pair of fully embroidered juthis (shoes) but have no issues over buying a pair of Nike trainers at 10 times the price - even though the latter has come off an assembly line while each juthi has been painstakingly and uniquely crafted by hand,\" she says.\nAnd while that continues, she says, foreign designers and merchandisers will do the same.\nReal change can only happen, she says, \"when we ourselves respect and appreciate them - and have the tools to combat their exploitation\".

        "summary": "Why Prada \u2013 and other luxury brands \u2013 keep getting India wrong2 days agoShareSaveZoya MateenBBC News, DelhiShareSaveGetty ImagesThe iconic Kolhapuri sandals drew attention after Prada was accused of replicating the design A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them.Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing a toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all.The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment.ANIA team from Prada met makers and sellers of Kolhapuri sandals this weekSome experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale.In the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices.But critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere.But not everyone shares the optimism.Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion.In recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall. Not doing so, she adds, is \"cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love\".Estimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity.Analysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India is expected to nearly double to $14bn by 2032. Prada told the BBC that it held a \"successful meeting\" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group.The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear.While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on.Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source.Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M ignited a fiery debate on cultural appropriation after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments.",

It has become an important export market for Moscow after several European countries cut trade when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nTrump did not specify what the new tariff would be, but it comes just days after he unveiled a hefty 25% levy on India. \nIn a statement, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry, Randhir Jaiswal, said the US had encouraged India to import Russian gas at the start of the conflict, \"for strengthening global energy markets stability\".\nHe said India \"began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict\".\nIndia also criticised the US - its largest trading partner - for introducing the tariffs, when the US itself is still doing trade with Russia. Last year, the US traded goods worth an estimated $3.5bn (\u00a32.6bn) with Russia, despite tough sanctions and tariffs. \n\"Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,\" the foreign ministry statement said.\n\"The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,\" it added.\nLast week, Trump had described India as a \"friend\" but said its tariffs on US products \"are far too high\" and he warned of an unspecified \"penalty\" over its trade with Russia.\nHis latest Truth Social post again struck a critical tone.\n\"India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,\" he wrote.\n\"Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,\" he added.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has not ordered India's oil refineries to stop buying Russian oil, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation.\nAjay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and head of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank, said Trump's claims about India's oil trade with Russia are misleading for several reasons. \nHe told the BBC that the trade has been transparent and broadly understood by the US. \nMr Srivastava said India ramped up purchases of oil to help stabilise global markets after Western sanctions disrupted supplies - helping to stop a global oil price shock. \nHe also said that India's oil refineries - both public and private - decide where to buy crude oil based on factors like price, supply security, and export rules. They operate independently of the government and do not need its approval to buy from Russia or other countries. \nThough relations between the US and Russia warmed after Trump returned to the White house in January, the US president has more recently toughened his rhetoric against the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTrump has questioned whether Putin is truly committed to peace with Ukraine. In Monday's Truth Social post he used stern language, describing the Russian military as the \"Russian War Machine\". \nRussia's leader has repeatedly said he is ready for peace but only if Kyiv meets certain conditions, such as recognising Ukrainian territories that Russia has occupied. \nTrump has threatened Moscow with severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by 8 August.\nUS envoy Steve Witkoff is due to visit Russia later this week, where he is expected to meet Putin.\nAdditional reporting by Soutik Biswas",

        "article_text": "In late July, lawyer Indira Jaising mounted a challenge against the legal age for having sex in India - which is 18 years - in the Supreme Court, renewing conversations around the criminalisation of teen sex.\nMs Jaising argued that consensual sex between 16 and 18-year-olds is neither exploitative nor abusive and urged the court to exempt it from criminal prosecution.\n\"The purpose of age-based laws is to prevent abuse, not to criminalise consensual, age-appropriate intimacy,\" Ms Jaising has said in her written submissions to the court.\nBut the federal government has opposed this, saying that introducing such an exemption would jeopardise the safety and protection of children (persons under the age of 18, according to Indian laws), opening them up to abuse and exploitation.\nThe case has re-ignited debate around consent and whether Indian laws, especially the country's main law against child sexual abuse - Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 or Pocso - should be altered to introduce a provision exempting 16 to 18 year-olds having consensual sex from their ambit.\nChild rights activists say exempting teens protects their autonomy, while opponents warn it could fuel crimes like trafficking and child marriage.\nExperts question whether teens can bear the burden of proof if abused. More importantly, who decides the age of consent laws - and whose interests do they truly serve?\nLike many countries, India has struggled to set its age of sexual consent. Unlike the US, where it varies by state, India enforces a uniform age nationwide.\nIndia's legal age for having sex is also much higher than most European countries, or places like UK and Canada, where it is 16.\nIt was 10 years when India's criminal code was enacted in 1860 and was increased to 16 in 1940 when the code was amended.\nPocso introduced the next major change, pushing the \"age of consent\" to 18 years in 2012. A year later, India's criminal laws were amended to reflect this change and the country's new criminal code, introduced in 2024, has adhered to this revised age.\nBut over the past decade or so, many child rights activists and even courts have taken a critical view of the country's legal age to have sex and have called for it to be lowered to 16 years. \nThey say the law criminalises consensual teen relationships and is often misused by adults to control or block relationships - especially those of girls.\nSex remains a taboo topic in the country even though studies have shown that millions of Indian teenagers are sexually active.\n\"As a society, we're also divided along caste, class and religious lines, which makes the [age of consent] law even more susceptible to misuse,\" says Sharmila Raje, co-founder of Foundation for Child Protection-Muskaan, a non-profit working to prevent child sexual abuse for over two decades.\nIn 2022, the Karnataka High court directed India's Law Commission -  an executive panel that advices the government on legal reform - to rethink the age of consent under Pocso, \"so as to take into consideration the ground realities\".\nIt noted several cases where girls over 16 fell in love, eloped, and had sex, only for the boy to be charged with rape and abduction under Pocso and criminal law.\nIn its report the following year, the Law Commission ruled out lowering the age of consent, but recommended \"guided judicial discretion\" during sentencing in cases involving \"tacit approval\" from children aged 16 to 18 years, meaning where the relationship has been consensual.\nThough this is yet to be implemented, courts across the country have been using this principle to allow for appeals, grant bail, make acquittals and even quash cases after taking into consideration the facts of the case and the victim's testimony.  \nMany child rights activists, including Ms Raje, urge this provision be codified to standardise enforcement; left as a suggestion, courts may ignore it.\nIn April, the Madras High Court overturned the acquittal in a case where the 17-year-old victim was in a relationship with the 23-year-old accused and the two eloped after the victim's parents arranged her marriage to another man. The accused was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\n\"The court adopted a literal interpretation of the Pocso Act,\" Shruthi Ramakrishnan, a researcher at Enfold Proactive Health Trust - a child rights charity - noted in her column in The Indian Express newspaper, calling it a \"grave miscarriage of justice\".\nMs Jaising argues that judicial discretion at sentencing isn't enough, as the accused still faces lengthy investigations and trials.\nIndia's judicial system is infamously slow with millions of cases pending across all court levels. A research paper by India Child Protection Fund found that as of January 2023, nearly 250,000 Pocso cases were pending in special courts set up to try these cases.\n\"The process is the punishment for many,\" Ms Jaising notes. \n\"A case-by-case approach leaving it to the discretion of judges is also not the best solution as it can result in uneven results and does not take into account the possibility of bias,\" she adds.\nShe urges the court to add a \"close-in-age exception\" for consensual sex between 16- and 18-year-olds in Pocso and related laws. This \"close-in-age exception\" would prevent consensual acts between peers in that age group from being treated as crimes.\nLawyer and child rights activist Bhuwan Ribhu warns that a blanket exception could be misused in cases of kidnapping, trafficking, and child marriage. He advocates judicial discretion paired with a justice system overhaul.\n\"We need faster processes so that cases are disposed off in a time-bound manner. We also need better rehabilitation facilities and compensation for victims,\" he says.\nEnakshi Ganguly, co-founder of HAQ: Centre for Child Rights, however, agrees with Ms Jaising. \n\"We can't shy away from making changes because we're afraid of the law being misused,\" she says, adding that Ms Jaising's argument is not new as over the years, many activists and experts have made similar recommendations.\n\"Laws need to keep pace with changes in society if they are to remain effective and relevant,\" she says.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "\"It's unfair to lift censorship suddenly,\" growls a grizzled newspaper editor into the phone, a copy of The Daily Pulp sprawled across his desk. \"We should be given time to prepare our minds.\"\nThe cartoon capturing this moment - piercing and satirical - is the work of Abu Abraham, one of India's finest political cartoonists. His pen skewered power with elegance and edge, especially during the 1975 Emergency, a 21-month stretch of suspended civil liberties and muzzled media under Indira Gandhi's rule.\nThe press was silenced overnight on 25 June. Delhi's newspaper presses lost power, and by morning censorship was law. The government demanded the press bend to its will - and, as opposition leader LK Advani later famously remarked, many \"chose to crawl\". \nAnother famous cartoon -  he signed them Abu, after his pen name - from that time shows a man asking another: \"What do you think of editors who are more loyal than the censor?\"\nIn many ways, half a century later, Abu's cartoons still ring true.  \nIndia currently ranks 151st in the World Press Freedom Index, compiled annually by Reporters Without Borders. This reflects growing concerns about media independence under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Critics allege increasing pressure and attacks on journalists, acquiescent media and a shrinking space for dissenting voices. The government dismisses these claims, insisting that the media remain free and vibrant. \nAfter nearly 15 years drawing cartoons in London for The Observer and The Guardian, Abu had returned to India in the late 1960s. He joined the Indian Express newspaper as a political cartoonist at a time when the country was grappling with intense political upheaval.\nHe later wrote that pre-censorship - which required newspapers and magazines to submit their news reports, editorials and even ads to government censors before publication - began two days after the Emergency was declared, was lifted after a few weeks, then reimposed a year later for a shorter period.\n\"For the rest of the time I had no official interference. I have not bothered to investigate why I was allowed to carry on freely. And I am not interested in finding out.\"\nMany of Abu's Emergency-era cartoons are iconic. One shows then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed signing the proclamation from his bathtub, capturing the haste and casualness with which it was issued (Ahmed signed the Emergency declaration that Gandhi had issued shortly before midnight on 25 June).\nAmong Abu's striking works are several cartoons boldly stamped with \"Not passed by censors\", a stark mark of official suppression.\nIn one, a man holds a placard that reads \"Smile!\" - a sly jab at the government's forced-positivity campaigns during the Emergency. His companion deadpans, \"Don't you think we have a lovely censor of humour?\" - a line that cuts to the heart of state-enforced cheer.\nAnother seemingly innocuous cartoon shows a man at his desk sighing, \"My train of thought has derailed.\" Another features a protester carrying a sign that reads \"SaveD democracy\" - the \"D\" awkwardly added on top, as if democracy itself were an afterthought.\nAbu also took aim at Sanjay Gandhi, the unelected son of Indira Gandhi, who many believed ran a shadow government during the Emergency, wielding unchecked power behind the scenes. Sanjay's influence was both controversial and feared. He died in a plane crash in 1980 - four years before his mother, Indira, was assassinated by her bodyguards.\nAbu's work was intensely political. \"I have come to the conclusion that there's nothing non-political in the world. Politics is simply anything that is controversial and everything in the world is controversial,\" he wrote in Seminar magazine in 1976.\nHe also bemoaned the state of humour - strained and manufactured - when the press was gagged.\n\"If cheap humour could be manufactured in a factory, the public would rush to queue up in our ration shops all day. As our newspapers become progressively duller, the reader, drowning in boredom, clutches at every joke. AIR [India's state-run radio station] news bulletins nowadays sound like a company chairman's annual address. Profits are carefully and elaborately enumerated, losses are either omitted or played down. Shareholders are reassured,\" Abu wrote.\nIn a tongue-in-cheek column for the Sunday Standard in 1977, Abu poked fun at the culture of political flattery with a fictional account of a meeting of the \"All India Sycophantic Society\".\nThe spoof featured the society's imaginary president declaring: \"True sycophancy is non-political.\" \nThe satirical monologue continued with mock proclamations: \"Sycophancy has a long and historic tradition in our country\u2026 'Servility before self' is our motto.\" \nAbu's parody culminated in the society's guiding vision: \"Touching all available feet and promoting a broad-based programme of flattery.\"\nBorn as Attupurathu Mathew Abraham in the southern state of Kerala in 1924, Abu began his career as a reporter at the nationalist Bombay Chronicle, driven less by ideology than a fascination with the power of the printed word. \nHis reporting years coincided with India's dramatic journey to independence, witnessing firsthand the euphoria that gripped Bombay (now Mumbai). Reflecting on the press, he later noted, \"The press has pretensions of being a crusader but is more often a preserver of the status quo.\"\nAfter two years with Shankar's Weekly, a well-known satire magazine, Abu set his sights on Europe. A chance encounter with British cartoonist Fred Joss in 1953 propelled him to London, where he quickly made a mark.\nHis debut cartoon was accepted by Punch within a week of arrival, earning praise from editor Malcolm Muggeridge as \"charming\".\nFreelancing for two years in London's competitive scene, Abu's political cartoons began appearing in Tribune and soon attracted the attention of The Observer's editor David Astor.\nAstor offered him a staff position with the paper.\n\"You are not cruel like other cartoonists, and your work is the kind I was looking for,\" he told Abu.\nIn 1956, at Astor's suggestion, Abraham adopted the pen name \"Abu\", writing later: \"He explained that any Abraham in Europe would be taken as a Jew and my cartoons would take on slant for no reason, and I wasn't even Jewish.\"\nAstor also assured him of creative freedom: \"You will never be asked to draw a political cartoon expressing ideas which you do not yourself personally sympathise.\"\nAbu worked at The Observer for 10 years, followed by three years at The Guardian, before returning to India in the late 1960s. He later wrote he was \"bored\" of British politics. \nBeyond cartooning, Abu served as a nominated member of India's upper house of Parliament from 1972 to 1978. In 1981, he launched Salt and Pepper, a comic strip that ran for nearly two decades, blending gentle satire with everyday observations. He returned to Kerala in 1988 and continued to draw and write until his death in 2002.\nBut Abu's legacy was never just about the punchline - it was about the deeper truths his humour revealed. \nAs he once remarked, \"If anyone has noticed a decline in laughter, the reason may not be the fear of laughing at authority but the feeling that reality and fancy, tragedy and comedy have all, somehow got mixed up.\"\nThat blurring of absurdity and truth often gave his work its edge. \n\"The prize for the joke of the year,\" he wrote during the Emergency, \"should go to the Indian news agency reporter in London who approvingly quoted a British newspaper comment on India under the Emergency, that 'trains are running on time' - not realising this used to be the standard English joke about Mussolini's Italy. When we have such innocents abroad, we don't really need humorists.\"\nAbu's cartoons and photograph, courtesy Ayisha and Janaki Abraham ",

        "article_text": "In the winter of 1956, The Times correspondent David Holden arrived on the island of Bahrain, then still a British protectorate. \nAfter a short-lived career teaching geography, Holden had looked forward to his Arabian posting, but he hadn't expected to be attending a garden durbar in honour of Queen Victoria's appointment as Empress of India. \nEverywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India. \n\"The Raj maintains here a slightly phantasmal sway,\" wrote Holden, \"a situation rich in anomaly and anachronism\u2026 The servants are all bearers, the laundryman a dhobi, and the watchman a chowkidar,\" he wrote, \"and on Sundays the guests are confronted with the ancient, and agreeable, Anglo-Indian ritual of a mountainous curry lunch.\" \nThe Sultan of Oman, educated in Rajasthan, was more fluent in Urdu than Arabic, while soldiers in the nearby state of Qu'aiti, now eastern Yemen, marched around in now-defunct Hyderabadi army uniforms.\nIn the words of the governor of Aden himself: \n\"One had an extraordinarily powerful impression that all the clocks here had stopped seventy years ago; that the Raj was at its height, Victoria on the throne, Gilbert and Sullivan a fresh and revolutionary phenomenon, and Kipling a dangerous debunker, so strong was the link from Delhi via Hyderabad to the South Arabian shore.\"\nAlthough largely forgotten today, in the early 20th Century, nearly a third of the Arabian Peninsula was ruled as part of the British Indian Empire. \nFrom Aden to Kuwait, a crescent of Arabian protectorates was governed from Delhi, overseen by the Indian Political Service, policed by Indian troops, and answerable to the Viceroy of India.\nUnder the Interpretation Act of 1889, these protectorates had all legally been considered part of India. \nThe standard list of India's semi-independent princely states like Jaipur opened alphabetically with Abu Dhabi, and the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, even suggested that Oman should be treated \"as much a Native State of the Indian Empire as Lus Beyla or Kelat [present day Balochistan]\". \nIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern Yemen, which functioned as India's westernmost port and was administered as part of Bombay Province. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1931, he found many young Arabs identifying as Indian nationalists.\nEven at the time, however, few members of the British or Indian public were aware of this Arabian extension of the British Raj. \nMaps showing the full reach of the Indian Empire were only published in top secrecy, and the Arabian territories were left off public documents to avoid provoking the Ottomans or later the Saudis. \nIndeed, as one Royal Asiatic Society lecturer quipped:\n\"As a jealous sheikh veils his favourite wife, so the British authorities shroud conditions in the Arab states in such thick mystery that ill-disposed propagandists might almost be excused for thinking that something dreadful is going on there.\"\nBut by the 1920s, politics was shifting. Indian nationalists began to imagine India not as an imperial construct but as a cultural space rooted in the geography of the Mahabharata. London saw an opportunity to redraw borders. On 1 April 1937, the first of several imperial partitions was enacted and Aden was separated from India. \nA telegram from King George VI was read aloud:\n\"Aden has been an integral part of British Indian administration for nearly 100 years. That political association with my Indian Empire will now be broken, and Aden will take its place in my Colonial Empire.\"\nThe Gulf remained under the purview of the Government of India for another decade, however. \nBritish officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India.\"\nAs Gulf resident William Hay put it, \"it would clearly have been inappropriate to hand over responsibility for dealing with the Gulf Arabs to Indians or Pakistanis\". \nThe Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.\nMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. \nFew batted an eyelid, and 75 years on, the importance of what had just happened is still not fully understood in either India or the Gulf. \nWithout this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.\nWhen British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. So Britain retained its role in the Gulf for 24 more years, with an 'Arabian Raj' now reporting to Whitehall rather than to the Viceroy of India. \nIn the words of Gulf scholar Paul Rich, this was \"the Indian Empire's last redoubt, just as Goa was Portuguese India's last solitary vestige, or Pondicherry was the tag-end of French India\".\nThe official currency was still the Indian rupee; the easiest mode of transport was still the 'British India Line' (shipping company) and the 30 Arabian princely states were still governed by 'British residents' who had made their careers in the Indian Political Service.\nThe British only finally pulled out of the Gulf in 1971 as part of its decision to abandon colonial commitments east of Suez. \nAs David Holden wrote in July: \n\"For the first time since the heyday of Britain's East India Company, all the territories around the Gulf will be at liberty to seek their own salvation without the threat of British intervention, or the comfort of British protection. This final remnant of the British Raj - for that, in effect, is what it is \u2013 has been for some years now an obvious, if in some ways charming, anachronism \u2026 But its day is over.\"\nOf all the national narratives that emerged after the Empire's collapse, the Gulf states have been most successful at erasing their ties to British India. \nFrom Bahrain to Dubai, a past relationship with Britain is remembered, but governance from Delhi is not. The myth of an ancient sovereignty is crucial to keeping the monarchies alive. Yet private memories persist, particularly of the unimaginable class reversal that the Gulf has seen. \nIn 2009, Gulf scholar Paul Rich recorded an elderly Qatari gentleman who \"still got angry when he related to me the beating he received when as a young boy of seven or eight he stole an orange, a fruit which he had never seen before, from an Indian employee of the British agent\". \n\"The Indians, he said, were a privileged caste during his youth, and it gave him immense pleasure that the tables had turned and they now came to the Gulf as servants.\"\nToday Dubai, once a minor outpost of the Indian Empire with no gun salute, is the glittering centre of the new Middle East. \nFew of the millions of Indians or Pakistanis who live there know that there was a world in which India or Pakistan might have inherited the oil-rich Gulf, just as they did Jaipur, Hyderabad or Bahawalpur. \nA quiet bureaucratic decision, made in the twilight of empire, severed that link. Today, only the echoes remain.\nSam Dalrymple is the author of Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Nine years ago, an Indian student vanished into thin air. \nNajeeb Ahmed was studying biotechnology at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi, when he mysteriously went missing in October 2016.\nThe night before his disappearance, the then 27-year-old who lived in one of the university's residential hostels was involved in a scuffle with members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), a right-wing student group. The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. \nFor years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. \nNow a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. \n\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. \nMr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. \n\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. \n\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"\nBorn in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four. His family made many sacrifices to support his JNU education.\n\"After completing his undergraduate degree, he was adamant that he wanted to study at JNU,\" Ms Nafees said. \n\"I told him you can take admission, but you won't stay in the hostel. You are too naive. But he didn't listen to me.\"\nOn the night of 14 October, 2016, Mr Ahmed reportedly got into a scuffle with a group of students affiliated to ABVP who were campaigning for hostel elections. JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.\nIn his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. \nThe doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.\nAccording to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.\nA CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. \nMs Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. \nFor days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.\nIn November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.\nA month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. \nIn May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. \nA year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. \nThe agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.\nA one million rupees [$11,600; \u00a38,600] reward for information about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. \nThe case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. \nShe alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.\nThe agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.\n\nExplaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.\nThe judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.\n\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.\nThe court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.\nThe order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. \nColin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. \n\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. \nMs Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.\n\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked.  \n\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. \nHowever, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". \nMs Nafees says she's not done fighting. Every 15 October, the day her son vanished, she joins a candle march at JNU in his memory. The hope has dimmed, but the wait continues.\n\"Sometimes I wonder if I should put a nameplate outside our house,\" said Nafees Ahmed, his father. \n\"Our house has been renovated. What if he comes, but can't recognise it?\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on goods imported from India could hit the country's growth prospects, experts say.\nIt is unclear how big the hit could be, given that Trump has announced an unspecified penalty in addition to the 25% tariff rate.\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump said the penalty would be imposed on India starting 1 August for buying Russian oil and weapons \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE\".\nExperts say further details on the fine print of the penalty will be crucial to determine the actual economic impact of the decision.\n\"The tariff (and penalty) now proposed by the US is higher than what we had anticipated and is therefore likely to pose a headwind to India's GDP growth. The extent of the downside will depend on the size of the penalties imposed,\" Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency Icra, said in a statement.\nIcra had previously reduced its gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for India for this financial year from 6.5% to 6.2% due to the adverse impact of the tariff hikes.\nAnother brokerage Nomura said the tariffs were \"growth negative\" and India's GDP could take a hit of 0.2% as a result of the announcements.\nIndian stock markets reacted negatively to the news, opening in the red as trade began for the day.\n\"The market was expecting a tariff deal to work out as longer term US-India strategic interests are aligned,\" said Nilesh Shah, a fund manager.\nIndia and the US have held several rounds of negotiations for a trade deal over the past few months, with Delhi even reducing tariffs on goods like Bourbon whiskey and motorcycles to placate the US. But the US runs a $45bn (\u00a333bn) trade deficit with India, which Trump is keen to reduce.\nA 25% tariff plus additional penalties will leave India worse off relative to other Asian economies like Vietnam and China, \"the main countries we are competing against for investment and industrialisation\", Rahul Ahluwalia of the Foundation for Economic Development think-tank told the BBC.\nUS tariffs on Chinese imports fell from 145% to 30% after negotiations in Geneva and London. The two sides now have until 12 August to reach a long-term trade deal. Trump also inked a deal with Vietnam in early July, agreeing to levy tariffs of 20% compared with a 46% levy proposed in April.\nGiven that India's tariffs are no longer lower than these countries, an expected diversion of export supply chains in sectors like textiles to India is now unlikely.\n\"If the tariff is sustained, this move may directly affect key sectors such as marine products, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather and automobiles, where bilateral trade has been especially robust,\" said Agneshwar Sen, trade policy expert at EY India.\nTrump's announcement evoked across-the-board reactions of disappointment and concern from economists, exporters and industry leaders in India.\n\"While this move is unfortunate and will have a clear bearing on our exports, we hope that this imposition of higher tariffs will be a short-term phenomenon and that a permanent trade deal between the two sides will be finalised soon,\" Mr Harsha Vardhan Agarwal, president of industry body FICCI, said.\nDr Ajay Sahai, who heads a federation of Indian exporting organisations, said the tariffs will lead to fresh price negotiations between US buyers and Indian sellers to decide how much of the 25% hike exporters can absorb.\nTariffs are typically taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. Exporters are indirectly impacted by higher tariffs because these taxes make goods costly for end-consumers, and lead to reduced demand. This can force exporters to cut prices in order to remain competitive, impacting their margins.\nIn a press statement, India's commerce ministry said it is studying the \"implications\" of Trump's announcement.\nIndia has reiterated that while the government remains committed to a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement, it attached \"the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises]\", - an indication that areas like agriculture, dairy and other politically sensitive sectors have become key sticking points that derailed the negotiations.\nIndia's opposition Congress party mounted a scathing attack on the government following the announcement.\nIn a post on X, the Congress said that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned for Trump - referring to a 2019 rally Modi held in the US - and hugged him like a long-lost brother, in return \"Trump goes on to impose such harsh tariff on India. It is a catastrophic failure of foreign policy\".\nTrump's hyphenation of the trade deal with India's economic relationship with Russia further \"complicates the situation\", said Mark Linscott of the US India Strategic Partnership Forum and a former US government trade representative.\n\"They add a whole new dimension to the negotiations, and it's not clear how this set of issues can be added to a trade package.\"\nSince the war in Ukraine began, India has resolutely defended its historic ties with Russia and also its oil purchases, saying that a country reliant on energy imports will buy oil at the best price possible to ensure that millions of poor Indians do not suffer. India's dependence on Russian arms has also been gradually coming down.\nMr Linscott said despite the setbacks, both India and the US have substantial shared interests in restarting negotiations and concluding an interim deal. US is India's largest foreign export market with bilateral trade amounting to $190bn and a stated goal to take it to $500bn in the years to come.\n\"The President insists on putting his stamp on every deal.  For that to happen with India, I think it required Prime Minister Modi to reach out to negotiate the last elements directly with the President, including any headline commitments on purchases of energy and military equipment and investments in the United States. For whatever reason, that did not happen,\" he added.\nWhile Trump has called India a \"good friend\", he has also repeatedly taken aim at India's high tariffs. On Thursday morning, in a particularly acerbic post on his Truth Social platform, he said: \"I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.\"\nBut despite the growing tensions, negotiations between India and the US are likely to continue through August, with a team from the US expected in India later next month to thrash out a comprehensive trade agreement.\nThe hope among many is that tariffs will get negotiated lower and the higher reciprocal tariff rate of 25% may be temporary, till a detailed trade deal with the US is secured. The two sides have set a fall deadline to conclude the deal. \nBut the best-case outcome would still be tariffs in the 15-20% range, \"which is disappointing, considering India's more advanced stage of negotiations\", said Nomura.\nWhile the impact could be contained, given that the Indian economy is relatively more domestically oriented and less reliant on goods trade than other Asian peers, Nomura believes Trump's decision could \"increase the likelihood of monetary policy easing\" and prompt India's central bank to make deeper rate cuts to protect growth.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

The opportunity that arose for us to not be the nice guys was because of what they did the night before.\n\"We watched two of our guys out there on their own, going back at the Indians after they were going at them. We just thought 'we're not standing for that'.\n\"We had a conversation and said 'it's time to not be those nice guys that we have been before'.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBrook on the 'needle' between England and India before the fourth Test\nNew Zealander McCullum's desire for England to show a different side to their character coincides with, or has resulted in, the enlisting of former All Blacks mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka.\nDuring his time as New Zealand captain, McCullum altered the approach and perception of his team, using Enoka's theories on team culture as inspiration.\nEnoka represented New Zealand at volleyball, but is best known for his work with the All Blacks. With Enoka on the staff, New Zealand won the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and 2015.\nHe first linked up with England before the one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May. It was at that time McCullum and captain Ben Stokes spoke about their team showing more \"humility\".\nEnoka's presence is designed to aid the mental development of the England side in this year that includes the series against India and the Ashes tour of Australia.\nOn Monday he addressed the squad two days out from the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, where victory would give England a series win.\nIn terms of their combativeness on the field, England have lost some of their more aggressive characters in recent years. Stuart Broad and James Anderson have retired, while Jonny Bairstow and Ollie Robinson have been dropped.\nBrook, who made his Test debut in McCullum's first summer in charge in 2022, said England had been \"nice guys\" for three years.\n\"At Lord's we had a conversation, we thought it was the perfect opportunity to not be the nice guys that we have been in the past three years,\" said the Yorkshireman. \"To go out there and put them under more pressure than what they have probably had before.\n\"I don't think it's against the spirit of cricket. We weren't being personal, we weren't being nasty, we were just putting them under more pressure.\n\"We weren't going out there effing and jeffing at them, and being nasty people.

        "article_text": "India's Smriti Mandhana is the number one ranked batter in ODIs, with Nat Sciver-Brunt third\nEngland's new era under head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt started with a ruthless clean sweep against the West Indies, but their first real challenge begins on Saturday, with the first of five T20s against India taking place at Trent Bridge. \nThey are followed by three one-day internationals, which will be hugely important in preparation for the World Cup which is being hosted by India in the autumn. \nSuch is the anticipation for the series, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) commissioned 'Bend it Like Beckham' director Gurinder Chadha to direct a promotional trailer for the ongoing men's, women's and mixed disability series in which India face England in all three.\nIndia are ranked third in the world in both white-ball formats with England in second, and the introduction of the Women's Premier League (WPL) has significantly improved their strength in depth and experience of playing in front of packed crowds under pressure. \nBBC Sport looks at the players to watch and the storylines to keep an eye out for.\nSciver-Brunt and India batter Smriti Mandhana are two of the game's biggest icons - at the first auction for the WPL in 2023, the England all-rounder sold for about \u00a3320,000 and the elegant India left-hander was the most expensive pick at \u00a3340,000.\nMandhana is the world's top-ranked batter in ODIs with Sciver-Brunt in third, while they are fourth and ninth in T20s respectively. \nTheir individual successes could go a long way in defining the series. England win 79% of their ODIs if Sciver-Brunt passes 50, and that figure rises to 82% in T20s.\nIndia rely a little more on Mandhana in the longer format with a win percentage of 76% if she scores a half-century, compared to 60% in T20s. \nIn general, India are likely to present a bigger challenge to England with the bat as their bowling looks depleted without the experience and prolific swing of the injured Renuka Singh Thakur.\nIn their warm-ups, they have conceded 353-5 to England's Select XI in a 50-over match and 194-8 in the T20, eventually losing both.\nMandhana, named Wisden's leading women's cricketer in the world for 2024, has an excellent record against England, averaging 51.68 in ODIs and a fraction over 38 in T20s, but there are areas of weakness for the bowlers to target.\nIn T20s, England's seamers should target Mandhana on the stumps early in her innings with movement into the left-hander - she averages 23 against in-swing compared to 40 against balls that swing away from her. \nCharlie Dean and Alice Capsey should also take note as off-spin is the best match-up to Mandhana. Since 2022, she averages 24 with a strike-rate of 108 - her lowest average and strike-rate against any type of bowling. \nSophie Ecclestone took 4-12 as Lancashire won the T20 Women's County Cup final\nThe return of Ecclestone, the world's number one bowler in ODIs and ranked fourth in T20s, has dominated the build-up to the series as she returns to the England fold for the first time since the Ashes. \nThe left-arm spinner made headlines for her off-field behaviour in Australia when she refused a TV interview with former team-mate turned pundit Alex Hartley, who had criticised the team's fitness after the T20 World Cup.\nShe was then left out of Edwards' first squads for the West Indies series, having missed the start of Lancashire's season with a knee injury. England insisted her absence was due to a lack of game time and to recover from the niggle, though Ecclestone played for her county on the same day the squad was announced.\nIt was confirmed at the beginning of this month that Ecclestone would take a break from county cricket to \"prioritise her wellbeing\" and to manage a quad problem, before Edwards named her in the squad to face India. \n\"This is the best preparation for Sophie, to be ready for India,\" Edwards said after the final ODI against West Indies, when asked about her previous statements that she wanted to pick players based on form in domestic cricket. \n\"She has been playing, she has performed really well, including winning the T20 Cup with Lancashire, so I'm happy with how she is tracking.\" \nDespite a difficult period for England, Ecclestone's numbers have never dropped - in 2024 she took 24 wickets in T20s, averaging 14.87 with an economy rate of just 5.59, and 13 scalps in ODIs at a remarkable average of 7.23.\nBut with fellow left-armer Smith impressing against West Indies, including a five-for on ODI debut - alongside Edwards' insistence that nobody's place in the side is guaranteed - it is unlikely Ecclestone has ever been under pressure like this before.\nOne of England's most significant weaknesses over the past couple of years has been their ability against spin, and an apparent lack of strategy against it. \nThough West Indies' bowling line-up was unthreatening and England's batters dominated throughout, there were some suggestions this is still a concern and will be tested both in this upcoming series, and more significantly in the World Cup where conditions will suit the spinners.\nIn the T20s, West Indies opened with Zaida James' spin and she removed Danni Wyatt-Hodge twice with the first ball of the match, while Hayley Matthews took 3-32 in the third T20 and 2-49 in the first ODI. \nThough England drew the 2023 Ashes at home, 23 wickets fell to off-spinner Ash Gardner and a surprise T20 series defeat by Sri Lanka followed as the tourists wisely packed their side with slow bowlers. \nLeg-spinner Alana King then matched Gardner's tally at the start of this year as England lost 40 wickets to spin in the series at an average of just 12.3. \nThere is no doubt India will be aware of this and it works to their advantage, too - since 2023, 58% of their deliveries bowled in both white-ball formats have been from spinners, and they have accounted for 62% of their wickets in T20s and 65% in ODIs.\nDeepti Sharma's run out of Charlie Dean sealed a 3-0 ODI series win for India in 2022\nIndia's last tour of England in 2022 saw the visitors claim a 3-0 clean sweep in the ODIs, with Sciver-Brunt and then-captain Heather Knight's absences sorely felt, but it was the final act of the series at Lord's which saw it end in controversy. \nIn a thrilling finale, England needed 17 runs to win while India required just one wicket when spinner Deepti Sharma ran out Dean on 47 at the non-striker's end - often referred to as a 'Mankad'. \nDean was in tears, stand-in captain Amy Jones said she was \"not a fan\" while India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur backed her bowler. \nDean jokingly re-enacted the dismissal in a game for Southern Vipers the following day and the pair have since played together for London Spirit, winning The Hundred last year.\nBut at Lord's on 19 July, their reunion will inevitably take the spotlight. \n\"It's in the laws, it happens, so unless the laws change and become a little bit more obvious in terms of what counts and what doesn't, then it's going to keep happening,\" said England batter Tammy Beaumont. \n\"We have to get on board with that unfortunately. I'm sure externally there will be plenty of replays but we'll be keeping our bats behind the line for sure.\n\"We'll play in a competitive spirit as we always do against India, but definitely we will be respectful to all their players too.\"\nFollow ball by ball commentary of every match of India's tour of England on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app. TV highlights will be available on iPlayer and the Red Button.",

        "article_text": "India's showpiece software industry is facing a moment of reckoning.\nThe country's biggest private sector employer Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) - also its largest IT services company - has announced it will cut more than 12,000 jobs at middle and senior management levels. This will reduce the firm's workforce by 2%.\nThe Mumbai-headquartered software behemoth employs over half-a-million IT workers and is considered a bellwether for business sentiment across India's $283bn software industry. It forms the backbone of formal, white-collar employment in the country.\nThe decision, TCS says, was taken to make the company \"future ready\" as it invests in new areas and deploys artificial intelligence at scale amid seismic disruptions in its traditional business model.\nCompanies like TCS have, for decades, relied on cheap skilled labour to produce software for global clients at lower costs, but this has been upended by AI automating tasks and clients demanding more innovative solutions, rather than just cost savings on manpower.\n\"A number of re-skilling and redeployment initiatives have been under way,\" TCS said in a statement, adding it will be \"releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible\".\n\"Across IT companies, people managers are being let go while the doers are being kept to rationalise the workforce and bring in efficiencies,\"  Neeti Sharma, CEO of staffing firm TeamLease Digital told the BBC. \nShe added that \"there's been a massive spike\" in emerging tech hiring in areas such as AI, cloud, data security, but it is not at the same intensity at which people are being fired.\nTCS's announcement also highlights the sharp \"skills mismatch\" in the country's software industry, experts say.\nAs generative AI leads to a rapid enhancement of productivity, \"this technology shift is forcing businesses to reassess their workforce structure and analyse if resources should be redirected toward roles that complement AI capabilities,\" Rishi Shah, economist with Grant Thornton Bharat told the BBC.\nAccording to the industry body Nasscom, India needs a million AI professionals by 2026, but not even 20% of the country's IT professionals are AI-skilled. \nWhile up-skilling spends by tech companies have significantly spiked as they rush to prepare a new pool of AI talent for the future, those without the requisite skills are being shown the door. \nBesides the structural shifts brought about by the advent of AI, TCS's announcement also \"reflects the broader growth challenges being faced by India's IT sector\", according to global investment banking firm Jeffries.\n\"Aggregate net hiring at industry level has been weak since FY22 [financial year 2022], mainly due to the prolonged moderation in demand outlook,\" Jeffries said in a note.\nDemand for IT services in the US \u2013 which contributes to half of the revenue for Indian software majors - has been impacted by Donald Trump's tariffs.\nWhile tariffs chiefly target physical goods, analysts say companies are pausing on discretionary IT spending as they reconsider the economic impact of tariff uncertainties and their global sourcing strategies.\nRising AI adoption is also driving US companies to negotiate lower costs, forcing people heavy IT firms to work with fewer employees, according to Jeffries.\nThe ripple effects of this have begun to be felt in cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune \u2013 once epicentres of India's IT boom. Some 50,000 people in the industry lost their jobs last year, according to one estimate. And there was a 72% drop in net employee additions at India's top six IT services companies.\nAll of this could have cascading effects on India's broader economy, which has struggled to create jobs for the millions of young graduates that enter the workforce every year.\nIn the absence of a strong manufacturing sector, these software companies - which made India the world's back office in the 1990s - were the preferred employment option for hundreds of thousands of new IT workers. They birthed a new, affluent middle class, spawning growth in many cities and fueling demand for cars and homes.\nBut as stable, well-paying jobs shrink, there are now questions over India's services-led economic boom.\nUntil just a few years ago, India's IT majors would absorb 600,000 fresh graduates every year. In the last two years, that number has dramatically fallen to about 150,000, according to TeamLease Digital.\nOther emerging sectors such as financial technology startups and GCCs (global capability centres) \u2013 which are off-shore units of multinational companies that perform supporting tasks like IT, finance or research and development - are absorbing the rest, but at least \"20-25% of fresh graduates will have no jobs,\" says Ms Sharma.\nShe adds that the \"GCCs will never match the volume of hiring that the IT companies did\".\nSeveral top business leaders in India have begun flagging the economic consequences of these trends.\nIndia's trimmed down IT sector could \"negatively impact many allied services and industries, crash real estate and give a big blow to premium consumption,\" D Muthukrishnan, one of south India's largest distributor of mutual-funds wrote on X, reacting to TCS's announcement. \nA few months ago Arindam Paul, entrepreneur and founder of the motor technology company Atomberg, warned of the potentially crippling impact of AI on India's middle class in a LinkedIn post. \n\"Almost 40-50% white collar jobs that exist today might cease to exist,\" Paul wrote. \"And that would mean the end of the middle class and the consumption story.\" \nHow quickly Indian tech giants adapt to the gamut of disruptions being brought by the AI revolution will decide whether the country can retain its edge as a global technology player. And whether it can expand its consuming middle-class that can keep its GDP growth on track.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The Western Indian town of Kolhapur has found itself in an unlikely global spotlight, as thousands of local artisans who hand-craft traditional leather footwear are mounting a collective attack on luxury fashion label Prada for plagiarising their designs without credit.\nThe rhythmic pounding of the hammer in 58-year-old Sadashiv Sanake's dimly lit workshop bears witness to the hard grind behind handcrafting the iconic Kolhapuri leather sandals.\n\"I learnt the craft as a child,\" he tells the BBC. A day's toil goes into making just \"eight to 10 pairs\" of these sandals he says, that retail at a modest $8-10\nBarely 5,000 artisans in Kolhapur are still in the profession \u2013 a cottage industry that struggles to compete in a mechanised world, caught in the funk of dismal working conditions and low wages.\nIt's no surprise then that when Italian luxury brand Prada released a new line of footwear that bore a striking resemblance to the Kolhapuri sandals - but didn't mention the design origins - local artisans were up in arms.\nThe backlash was swift. Social media was flooded with accusations of cultural appropriation, prompting Prada to issue a statement acknowledging the sandals' roots.\nNow local politicians and industry associations have thrown their weight behind the artisans who want better recognition of the craft and its cultural legacy. \nMr Sanake was not aware of Prada's show until the BBC showed him a video of it. When told that that the sandals could retail for hundreds of pounds in luxury markets, he scoffed. \"Do they have gold in them?\" he asked.\nPrada hasn't revealed the price tag but its other sandals retail at between \u00a3600 to \u00a31,000 in the UK as per its website. \nThe earliest records of Kolhapur sandals date back to the 12th Century.\n\"These sandals were originally crafted by members of the marginalised Charmakar (cobbler) community, also known as chamars,\" said Kavita Gagrani, a history professor at the New College in Kolhapur.\nChamar is a pejorative caste term used to describe Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) who work with animal hides.\n\"But in the early 20th Century, the craft flourished when the then ruler of Kolhapur, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj granted royal patronage to this community,\" Ms Gagrani said.\nToday, nearly 100,000 artisans across India are engaged in the trade with an industry worth over $200m, according to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA), a prominent industry trade group.\nYet, most of them continue to work in unorganised setups under dismal conditions.\n\"I was never educated. This is all I know, and I earn about $4-5 a day, depending on the number of orders,\" said 60-year-old Sunita Satpute.\nWomen like her play a critical role, particularly in engraving fine patterns by hand, but are not compensated fairly for their long hours of labour, she said.\nThat's why Sunita's children don't want to continue the craft.\nA short distance away from her workshop lies Kolhapur's famous chappal gully, or sandal lane, a cluster of storefronts - many of them struggling to stay afloat.\n\"Leather has become very expensive and has pushed up our costs,\" said Anil Doipode, one of the first sellers to open a shop here. \nTraditionally, artisans would use cow and buffalo hide to make these sandals. But since 2014, when the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, there have been several reports of vigilantes - self-appointed protesters or activists - cracking down on alleged cow slaughter, sometimes with physical violence. The cow is considered sacred by Hindus.\nIn 2015, Maharashtra state banned the slaughter of cows and the sale and consumption of beef, forcing artisans to rely on buffalo leather sourced from neighbouring states, pushing up their production costs.\nTraditional sellers are also struggling to compete with synthetic copies flooding the market.\n\"Customers want cheaper sandals and can't always tell the difference,\" said Rohit Balkrishna Gavali, a second-generation Kolhapuri sandal seller.\nIndustry experts say the controversy highlights the need for a better institutional framework to protect the rights of artisans.\nIn 2019, the Indian government had awarded Kolhapuri sandals the Geographical Indication (GI) - a mark of authenticity which protects its name and design within India, preventing unauthorised use by outsiders.\nGlobally, however, there is no binding law that stops other countries or brands from aesthetic imitation.\nAishwarya Sandeep, a Mumbai-based advocate, says that India could raise the issue at the World Trade Organization under its TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement, of which it is a signatory.\nBut the system is cumbersome, expensive and often lacks enforceability, both in India and abroad, she adds.\nLalit Gandhi, the president of MCCIA, says his organisation is planning to patent the Kolhapuri sandal design, hoping to create a legal precedent for future cases.\nBut some say real change can only happen when India starts seeing its traditional heritage in a different light. \n\"It's about ethical recognition. India must push for royalty-sharing and co-branding,\" says Ritu Beri, a renowned designer. \"The more we take pride in our culture, the less we will be exploited.\"\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time a global fashion brand has been accused of appropriating Indian handicrafts.\nMany big labels have featured Indian fabrics and embroidery work with little to no artist collaboration. \"Take Chikankari (a delicate hand-embroidery style from the northern Indian city of Lucknow), Ikat (a cloth-dyeing technique), mirror work; they've all been used repeatedly. The artisans remain invisible while brands profit from their inspiration,\" Ms Beri says.\nMr Gandhi, however, says that Prada's endorsement of Kolhapuri sandals could also be beneficial for artisans.\n\"Under their label, the value [of Kolhapuri sandals] is going to increase manifold,\" he says. \"But we want some share of that profit to be passed on to artisans for their betterment.\"\nRohit Balkrishna Gavali, a sandal-seller in Kolhapur, agrees - he has already begun to see the difference.\n\"The design Prada used wasn't even very popular, but now people are asking for it, with clients from Dubai, the US and Qatar\" placing orders, he says.\n\"Sometimes, controversy can help,\" he adds. \"But it would be nice if it also brought respect and better prices for those keeping this tradition alive.\"\nThe issue is unlikely to die down soon.\nFor now, a plea has been filed in a high court, demanding Prada pay damages and compensation to artisans, along with a court-supervised collaboration between the luxury label and artisan associations. \nPrada has told BBC in a statement that it is in talks with the MCCIA on this matter.   \nMr Gandhi, its chief, says a meeting between the two sides is going to take place next week.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

': The Indian artisans up in arms over Prada's sandals5 days agoShareSaveDevina GuptaBBC NewsReporting fromKolhapur, MaharashtraShareSaveBBCThe earliest records of Kolhapur sandals date back to the 12th Century.The Western Indian town of Kolhapur has found itself in an unlikely global spotlight, as thousands of local artisans who hand-craft traditional leather footwear are mounting a collective attack on luxury fashion label Prada for plagiarising their designs without credit.The rhythmic pounding of the hammer in 58-year-old Sadashiv Sanake's dimly lit workshop bears witness to the hard grind behind handcrafting the iconic Kolhapuri leather sandals. \"Customers want cheaper sandals and can't always tell the difference,\" said Rohit Balkrishna Gavali, a second-generation Kolhapuri sandal seller.Women artisans engrave fine patterns in the leather sandals by handIndustry experts say the controversy highlights the need for a better institutional framework to protect the rights of artisans.In 2019, the Indian government had awarded Kolhapuri sandals the Geographical Indication (GI) - a mark of authenticity which protects its name and design within India, preventing unauthorised use by outsiders.Globally, however, there is no binding law that stops other countries or brands from aesthetic imitation.Aishwarya Sandeep, a Mumbai-based advocate, says that India could raise the issue at the World Trade Organization under its TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement, of which it is a signatory.But the system is cumbersome, expensive and often lacks enforceability, both in India and abroad, she adds.Lalit Gandhi, the president of MCCIA, says his organisation is planning to patent the Kolhapuri sandal design, hoping to create a legal precedent for future cases.But some say real change can only happen when India starts seeing its traditional heritage in a different light. A day's toil goes into making just \"eight to 10 pairs\" of these sandals he says, that retail at a modest $8-10Barely 5,000 artisans in Kolhapur are still in the profession \u2013 a cottage industry that struggles to compete in a mechanised world, caught in the funk of dismal working conditions and low wages.It's no surprise then that when Italian luxury brand Prada released a new line of footwear that bore a striking resemblance to the Kolhapuri sandals - but didn't mention the design origins - local artisans were up in arms.ReutersPrada's leather footwear at the Milan Fashion Week sparked a major controversyThe backlash was swift. Social media was flooded with accusations of cultural appropriation, prompting Prada to issue a statement acknowledging the sandals' roots.Now local politicians and industry associations have thrown their weight behind the artisans who want better recognition of the craft and its cultural legacy.",
