        "article_text": "Israel says its fighter jets bombed an area next to the presidential palace in Syria's capital Damascus on Friday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to protect the Druze religious minority following days of deadly sectarian violence.\nNetanyahu said the strike was a \"clear message to the Syrian regime\" that Israel would \"not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community\".\nLater on Friday, the Israeli military confirmed it had launched another wave of air strikes, attacking military targets. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported nearly 20, with Syrian state media saying one person had been killed. \nThe Syrian presidency has said it strongly condemns the strikes, calling them a \"dangerous escalation\" intended to destabilise Syria.\nIsrael also carried out strikes south of Damascus on Wednesday during clashes between Druze gunmen, security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticised the recent Israeli bombing, calling it a \"violation of Syria's sovereignty\".\nIn a statement delivered by his spokesman, Guterres called for Israel to stop such attacks and to respect Syria's \"unity, its territorial integrity and its independence\".\nA spiritual leader of Syria's Druze, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence on Thursday as an \"unjustifiable genocidal campaign\" against his community and called for intervention by \"international forces to maintain peace\".\nOther Druze religious leaders put out a statement early on Friday confirming what they said was the community's \"commitment to a country that includes all Syrians, a nation that is free of strife\", according to the Associated Press.\nThey also reportedly said the state should be activated in Suweida province, and that authorities should be in control of the Suweida-Damascus highway.\nThe Syrian government said it had deployed security forces to Druze areas to combat \"outlaw groups\" which it accused of instigating the clashes.\nAccording to SOHR, at least 109 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, a town in the southern outskirts of Damascus, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.\nIt says that includes 11 Druze civilians and 26 Druze fighters, as well as another 42 Druze men who were shot dead in an \"ambush\" by security forces while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday. Thirty members of the General Security service and allied fighters have also been killed, it says.\nIstanbul-based Syria TV reported that the Israeli air strike near the presidential palace appeared to have targeted an empty area, and that there were no reports of casualties or material damage.\nIsrael's Defence Minister issued a statement saying that when the Syrian president woke up and saw the results he would \"understand well that Israel is determined to prevent harm to the Druze in Syria\".\n\"It is [Sharaa's] duty to protect the Druze in the suburbs of Damascus from jihadist assailants and to allow the hundreds of thousands of Druze in Suweida and Jabal al-Druze to defend themselves on their own, rather than sending jihadist forces into their communities,\" he added.\nIn a statement released on Friday afternoon, the Syrian presidency said it \"condemned in the strongest terms the bombing of the presidential palace yesterday by the Israeli occupation, which constitutes a dangerous escalation against state institutions and the sovereignty of the state\".\n\"This reprehensible attack reflects the continuation of reckless movements that seek to destabilize the country and exacerbate security crises,\" it added.\nThe presidency also called on the international community to stand by Syria in confronting the attacks, which it said violated international law.\nA Druze religious leader in Suweida, Sheikh Hamoud al-Hinawi, meanwhile told the BBC that the situation was \"still tense\" in the affected areas.\n\"What is happening right now is sectarian targeting by extremist elements [and] it is the duty of the state to protect civilians,\" he said.\n\"We support the rule of law and national sovereignty of Syria, as long as the national government is protecting its citizens and adhering to its commitment to rebuilding a modern Syria.\"\nWhen asked whether he supported the Israeli intervention, Sheikh Hinawi said: \"It's not a matter of whether I am for or against Israel - it is a matter of life and death for us and if we are being attacked we have every right to defend ourselves.\"\nOn Thursday, a member of the security forces deployed in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya told the BBC that they were \"not targeting any sect, but rather dealing with an armed group acting outside the law, regardless of its religious affiliation\", adding: \"Any such group will be held accountable.\"\nThe sectarian violence erupted in Jaramana on Monday night after an audio clip of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad circulated on social media and angered Sunni Muslims. It was attributed to a Druze cleric, but he denied any responsibility. The interior ministry also said a preliminary inquiry had cleared him.\nThe Druze faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs. Half its roughly one million followers live in Syria, where they make up about 3% of the population, while there are smaller communities in Lebanon, Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\nSyria's transitional President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has promised to protect the country's many religious and ethnic minorities since his Sunni Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad's regime in December after 13 years of devastating civil war.\nHowever, the mass killings of hundreds of civilians from Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region in March, during clashes between the new security forces and Assad loyalists, hardened fears among minority communities.\nIn February, Israel's prime minister warned that he would not \"tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria\" from the country's new security forces.\nNetanyahu also demanded the complete demilitarisation of Suweida and two other southern provinces, saying Israel saw Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as a threat. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.\nThe Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country's military assets over the past four months. It has also sent troops into the UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syria, as well as several adjoining areas and the summit of Mount Hermon.",

I can't believe it. There was big pressure and big nerves. I knew if I missed he could come back quickly,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"I was so nervous tonight. Mark is still a top player and put me under so much pressure. He's the best.\"\nAlong with the \u00a3500,000 top prize, he will climb to 11th in the world rankings when he returns to the main professional tour next season.\nZhao, who won the UK title in 2021, is the first amateur to triumph at the Crucible. He also becomes only the third qualifier after Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy to claim snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to Sheffield.\nHis achievement is all the more extraordinary given he was still suspended from the sport 12 months ago, with his burgeoning career abruptly halted when he was one of 10 Chinese players sanctioned in 2023 following an investigation into match-fixing.\nWhile Zhao did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself, and for those offences he received a 20-month ban.\nHis win over Williams was his 47th from 49 matches this term and vindicated the bookmakers' decisions to install him as one of the favourites before the tournament even got under way.\nTrailblazer Zhao set to take snooker to 'another level' in China\nMatch-fixing scandal to Crucible champion - fall and rise of Zhao\nWorld Championship: Results, schedule & roll of honour\nThis video can not be played\nI can't believe what I have achieved this month - Xintong\nZhao's win over Williams was a long-awaited moment for China, nine years on from Ding Junhui's 18-14 defeat by Mark Selby in the 2016 final.\n\"It is very good for Chinese snooker and I am very happy I have done this for them.\n\"I can't believe I could become world champion in such a short time [after the ban] so I am so proud of myself. It was nearly two years playing no competition, so my first target was to qualify. \n\"Now this will give them [children in China] power and in the future many Chinese players can do this.\"\nIt simply looked like a match too far for Williams, who overcame well-documented eye problems to reach a fifth final.\nHe appeared drained at times, following his semi-final success against world number one Judd Trump.\nThe 'Welsh Potting Machine' lost the two afternoon sessions by an aggregate score of 13-3 - a margin that proved too wide in a match which is sure to be viewed as a changing-of-the-guard moment.\n\"Unfortunately I was just never in the final from day one. I was behind from the start and could not get into it,\" said Williams.\n\"I said that if I could get out of the first session at 5-3 down it would have been a result, but I was 7-1 down and it was a bit far for me to get back. \n\"I've got nothing but admiration for what he's done, coming through the qualifiers. He hasn't played for two years, bashed everybody up. There's a new superstar of the game.\"\nThis video can not be played\nZhao plays two 'unbelievable flukes' in world snooker final",

'Completely inadequate'The report calls on ministers to force short-term let rental websites \"to share individualised, unit-level data with local authorities and the government\" and to introduce a mandatory national registration scheme for the sector. \"The report was endorsed by Tom Copley, Sir Sadiq Khan's deputy mayor for housing, who said with 65,000 homeless households in London living in temporary accommodation, \"we need to bring those properties back into use as long-term rented properties, or long-term properties for people to buy and live in as owner-occupiers\".A government spokesman told the LDRS the short-term let sector has seen rapid growth in recent years.",

        "article_text": "Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the \"capture\" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\".\nHe did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that \"they will not enter and come out\".\nThe cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.\nThe UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.\nA Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's \"pressure and blackmail\".\nAsked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there.\nThe UK meanwhile said it \"does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\". The EU earlier urged restraint, saying it was concerned about \"further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population\".\n\nIsrael's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March.\nAn Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to \"defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages\".\n\"The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,\" the official said.\nIsraeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated \"buffer zone\" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nLater, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. \nFar-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was \"going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip\", according to Reuters news agency.\nIsrael occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline.\nIn a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued. \nHowever, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was \"choosing territories over the hostages\" and that this was \"against the will of over 70% of the people\" in Israel.\nHamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including \"a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides\".\nPalestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes.\n\"In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,\" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said.\n\"We lived through unbearable conditions in what Israel claimed was a 'safe zone' in the south. This time, we will not leave, even if Israel brings down the tents over our heads.\"\nOsama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: \"Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.\"\nThe Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority \"the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities\".\nThe security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a \"sterile area\" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection.\nOn Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to \"shut down the existing aid distribution system\" and \"have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\".\nThe HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies.\n\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy,\" it said.\n\"It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.\"\nIsrael cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive.\nAccording to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies.\nThe blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system.\nThe UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 52,567 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,459 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands \u2013 and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia da Camerino steers her boat past the briccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible \u2013 to non-Venetians \u2013 lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground \u2013 and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nDa Camerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in the carciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as a castra\u00f9ra. The castra\u00f9re are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant \u2013 giving them their name \u2013 in order to allow the botoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for da Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castra\u00f9ra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat \u2013 not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castra\u00f9re are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castra\u00f9re's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto \u2013 this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like its terraferma counterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty \u2013 a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of an acqua alta (seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says da Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castra\u00f9re were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castra\u00f9ra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castra\u00f9re could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castra\u00f9re don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Da Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castra\u00f9re \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castra\u00f9re so they can hike up the prices.\"\nHow to try castra\u00f9re\n\u2022 Plan a trip to Venice around mid-April to hit the height of the castra\u00f9re season.\n\u2022 Always ring ahead to see if restaurants are serving them, since it's so dependent on the harvest.\n\u2022 If you want to try preparing them at home, make sure you only buy artichokes with the consorzio's label \u2013 and don't be afraid to grill the seller about where they come from.\n\u2022 If you miss the season, don't worry; you can buy a jar of violet artichokes preserved in oil from Finotello's farm on Sant'Erasmo.\n\u2022 You can also get them in liquid form: the amaro digestif Venesian is made from Sant'Erasmo artichokes. Pick up a bottle to take home at the delicatessen Maramao, which sells local products from its canalside shop in the Cannaregio district.\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castra\u00f9re when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years,\u00a0rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castra\u00f9re symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castra\u00f9re dishes: a silky, gently saut\u00e9ed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to da Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castra\u00f9re that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farm I Sapori di Sant'Erasmo with his brother Claudio and is also the president of the Consorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castra\u00f9re but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist \u2013 but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castra\u00f9re from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n \u2022\u00a0The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n \u2022\u00a0Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castra\u00f9re. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castra\u00f9ra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised with scoasse (garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castra\u00f9re he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices of colomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike \u2013 and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \n\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

        "article_text": "On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape \u2013 from what was the US's most secure prison \u2013 continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime.\nIn May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made \"the most feared journey in the criminal world\" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed \"the Rock\", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped.\nIn the news\nOn 4 May, US president Donald Trump said, in a post on his Truth Social site, that he would call for the reopening of Alcatraz, the once-notorious island prison which now serves as a tourist site in the San Francisco Bay. He wrote that it would become \"a symbol of law, order and justice\". Read more by BBC News's Gabriela Pomeroy, here.\nAlcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\". \"Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,\" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it.\nFour years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night.\nWhen the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. \"A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,\" he said. \"Built over the rambling passages of an old fort\u2026 the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up.\"\nWith Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood.\nBut while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How D-Day began with a death-defying mission\n\u2022 The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness\n\u2022 Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\nFinally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it\u00a0\u2013 carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower\u00a0\u2013 shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered.\nThe island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. \"When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,\" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. \"I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was.\"\nThe prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again.\u00a0\nAlthough the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964.\" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,\" he said. \"Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?\"\nAlcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: \"the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nOver the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves \u2013 unable to face the unrelenting conditions \u2013 and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment.\nAs for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service.\nBut speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them.\u00a0\nIn 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read \"I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!\" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not.\nThe case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.\u00a0\nThis article was originally published on 10 June 2024 and has been republished.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The Red Bull's speed in the fast sweepers there was too much for McLaren to claw back in the remainder of the lap.\nNorris 'very happy' despite missing out on pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\n\"It's been a great qualifying,\" Verstappen said. \"We improved the car a tiny amount, which helped me rotate it a bit better.\n\"Q1, Q2, Q3 improving every run. Trying to find the limit. I had a tiny moment into Turn One trying to find more time there but it's very tricky here with the tyres. It's qualifying, try to correct it and floor it out of the corner.\"\nIt was a second piece of good news for the four-time champion this week, after the birth of his first child, a daughter called Lily.\nNorris said: \"Congrats to Max, especially being a dad now. I was hoping it would slow him down a bit but it clearly didn't.\n\"Max did a Max lap again and I'm happy for him. The pace is there. I have been feeling good. It is what it is, I'm P2, Max on pole, ready to see what I can do into Turn One.\"\nAntonelli's third place proved his pole in the sprint on Friday was not a flash in the pan, on a weekend where he is showing the spark of prodigious talent that convinced Mercedes to put the 18-year-old straight into their team in his debut season. He beat team-mate George Russell by 0.114secs.\nIt also made amends to some degree for a disappointing sprint result, where he lost the lead at the start and then was hit by Verstappen's car in the pits and finished seventh.\n\"This weekend is going well so far,\" he said. \"It was a bit disappointing this morning, but happy to bounce back. I was a bit too greedy into Turn One but the rest of the lap was quite good. The gaps are super-tight.\"\nPiastri, winner of the last two races to put him into the championship lead, said his fourth place was down to \"poor execution - there was quite a bit left on the table\".\nA strong showing for Williams in sixth and seventh underlined the troubles of Ferrari, where Leclerc was 0.483secs off the pace and Hamilton failed to make it into the top 10 shootout.\nHe was just 0.058secs off Leclerc in the second session, but that was enough for four places, and it left him ruing a decision not to use an extra set of new tyres that he had available.\n\"It's always a surprise every session you go out what the car is doing,\" Hamilton said. \"It's a bit of a mess at the moment balance-wise. Unfortunate to have not got through. Same old.\"\nLeclerc said: \"It is just not good enough. It is frustrating because it is those kind of days and it has been quite a few races already that I feel I am doing a really good job. But when you are finishing P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, it is just a shame.

We are here to win and today we were miles off that, so it doesn't really matter if you are a P3 or P4.\n\"I had nothing to lose, so I also just wanted to have a bit of fun out there.\"\nNorris lost out on a likely race win as a result of his first-lap incident with Verstappen.\nHe challenged the Red Bull on the outside of the first corner, and when Verstappen ran slightly deep, Norris cut back and tried to pass around the outside of the second corner.\nVerstappen took the racing line, appearing to flick his car towards Norris, and the McLaren went off the track into the run-off area and slipped to sixth.\nHad he backed off, Norris could have been the leading McLaren driver to attack Verstappen and given the car's dominant pace may well have won the race.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"With the benefit of hindsight, let's say that considering the situation in corner one-two, it could have been better for Lando to just lift and make sure that he could keep the second position because the car, again, with the benefit of hindsight, we see that he was very fast and he would certainly have passed Max, like Oscar, and then later Lando was in condition to do.\n\"So I think like every situation in racing, you have to approach with the mindset of reviewing where the opportunities lie.

So I don't think we should over-read too much into situations. I think it's, like I said before, it's a matter sometimes of a fraction of a second or a fraction of a metre.\n\"The big time loss came because of having to give back the position. So I think in terms of overtaking manoeuvre and precision and determination, I don't see that there's any difference between both drivers.\"\nOnce he passed Verstappen, Norris closed on Piastri in the second stint, but ran out of time to close the gap.\nMcLaren dominated in Miami with a one-two in the sprint and main race\nPiastri's win was his third in a row and fourth in six races and he leads Norris by 16 points in the championship, with Verstappen a further 16 adrift.\nThe Australian said: \"It was tough at the beginning trying to get past Max. I tried pretty hard to get past, with everything still on my car.\n\"It was not easy but I picked my moments when I needed to. I could tell that we had a lot of pace from the get-go today, and it was going to be a matter of when I got past, not if.\n\"But I wanted to do it as efficiently as I could because I knew once Lando got back behind me, he was going to be catching us a lot. I wanted to get through quickly but cleanly. I felt like I did a pretty good job of that, then built a gap. Maybe not the strongest second half of the race of my life, but I think building that gap and being quick at the right times was what I needed.\n\"It was a matter of just biding my time, waiting for a moment, or forcing him into a moment.

        "article_text": "On Wednesday, a cache of dazzling jewels linked to the Buddha's mortal remains, which have been hailed as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era, will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.\nFor over a century these relics, unearthed from a dusty mound in northern India in 1898, have sat largely unseen, cradled by a private British collection.\nNow, as the gems prepare to leave the custody of their keepers, they are stirring not just collectors' appetites but also some unease.\nThey come from a glittering hoard of nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, topaz, sapphires, and patterned gold sheets, first glimpsed deep inside a brick chamber in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India, near the Buddha's birthplace.\nTheir discovery \u2013 alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself \u2013 reverberated through the world of archaeology. Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia and worldwide head of Asian Art, believes this is \"among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time\".\nYet as these relics now face the glare of the auction room, experts tell the BBC that a question hangs heavy: can the sale of treasures so intimately woven into India's sacred past be considered ethical?\nIn 1898, William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, where the Buddha is believed to have been born. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago. \nHistorians agree these relics, intact until then, are the heritage of both the Buddha's Sakya clan descendants and Buddhists worldwide. The bone relics have since been distributed to countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where they continue to be venerated. \n\"Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?\" wonders Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian. \"And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?\n\"Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask \u2013 custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?\"\nChris Pepp\u00e9, great-grandson of William, told the BBC the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".\nJulian King, Sotheby's international specialist and head of sale, Himalayan Art, New York told the BBC the auction house had made a thorough review of the jewels.\n\"As is the case with any important items and collectibles that are offered for sale at Sotheby's, we conducted requisite due diligence, including in relation to authenticity and provenance, legality and other considerations in line with our policies and industry standards for artworks and treasures,\" King said.\nAshley Thompson, of Soas University of London, and curator Conan Cheong, both experts in Southeast Asian art, have more questions. In a joint statement they told the BBC: \"Other ethical questions raised by the sale are: should human remains be traded? And who gets to decide what are human remains or not? For many Buddhist practitioners around the world, the gems on sale are part and parcel of the bones and ash.\"\nThe sale of the relics has also sparked concern among Buddhist leaders.\n\"The Buddha teaches us not to take other people's possessions without permission,\" Amal Abeyawardene of London-based British MahaBodhi Society, told the BBC. \"Historical records indicate that the Sakyamuni clan were granted custody of these relics, as the Buddha emanated from their community. Their wish was for these relics to be preserved alongside adornments, such as these gems, so that they may be venerated in perpetuity by the Buddha's followers.\"\nChris Pepp\u00e9 has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins. That's when he began researching their discovery by his great-grandfather.\nThe Los Angeles-based television director and film editor wrote he had found 1898 newspaper reports - from Reuters to the New York Tribune - announcing the find of Buddha's remains.\n\"The colonisation of India by the British had been a source of some cultural shame for me [and continues to be] but, amidst the treasure hunters who hauled their finds back to England, there had also been people focused on the pursuit of knowledge,\" Chris Pepp\u00e9 writes.\nHe noted his research revealed a lot about his ancestors who he had dismissed as \"prejudiced Victorians from a bygone era\".  \n\"I learned that Willie Pepp\u00e9's first wife chose to travel around India for her honeymoon and loved the country and its culture. Sadly, she died from an unspecified illness. I learned that my grandmother was outraged at the land laws that applied to Indian women.\n\"And I learned that the excavation of the stupa was an attempt by Willie Pepp\u00e9 to provide work for his tenant farmers who had fallen victim to the famine of 1897.\"\nHe writes his great-grandfather's \"technical diagrams of ramps and pulleys suggest that he was also a trained engineer who couldn't resist a project\".\nWilliam Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.\nOnly a small \"portion of duplicates\", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the Pepp\u00e9 family, he notes. (Sotheby's notes say Pepp\u00e9 was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)  \nSources told the BBC the auction house considers the \"duplicates\" to be original items considered surplus to those donated, which the \"Indian government permitted Pepp\u00e9 to retain\". \nOver the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The Pepp\u00e9 family has also launched a website to \"share our research\".\nSome scholars argue Buddha relics should never be treated as market commodities. \n\"The Sotheby's auction transforms these highly sacred materials into saleable objects, in continuation of acts of colonial violence which extracted them from a stupa and called them 'gems' and 'objects of interest to Europeans', creating a false division with the ash and bone fragments they were consecrated with,\" say Thompson and Cheong. \nChris Pepp\u00e9 told the BBC that in all the monasteries he had visited \"no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics\".\n\"A few Buddhist academics\u00a0at western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such.\u00a0It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,\" he said.\nPepp\u00e9 said the family \"looked into donation [of the relics] to temples and museums and they all presented different problems on closer scrutiny\".   \n\"An auction seems the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists and we are confident that Sotheby's will achieve that.\" \nSome also point to The Koh-i-Noor, seized by the British East India Company and now part of the Crown Jewels, with many Indians viewing it as stolen. Should the Buddha's jewels be next?\n\"Repatriation, I believe, is seldom necessary,\" says Ahuja. \"Such rare and sacred relics that are unique and which define a land's cultural history, however, deserve the government's exceptional attention.\"",

Jewels linked to Buddha remains go to auction, sparking ethical debate2 days agoShareSaveSoutik BiswasIndia correspondent\u2022@soutikBBCShareSaveCourtesy: Sotheby'sThe jewels comprise nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, sapphires, and patterned gold sheetsOn Wednesday, a cache of dazzling jewels linked to the Buddha's mortal remains, which have been hailed as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era, will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.For over a century these relics, unearthed from a dusty mound in northern India in 1898, have sat largely unseen, cradled by a private British collection.Now, as the gems prepare to leave the custody of their keepers, they are stirring not just collectors' appetites but also some unease.They come from a glittering hoard of nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, topaz, sapphires, and patterned gold sheets, first glimpsed deep inside a brick chamber in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India, near the Buddha's birthplace.Their discovery \u2013 alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself \u2013 reverberated through the world of archaeology. Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia and worldwide head of Asian Art, believes this is \"among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time\".Yet as these relics now face the glare of the auction room, experts tell the BBC that a question hangs heavy: can the sale of treasures so intimately woven into India's sacred past be considered ethical?Courtesy Pepp\u00e9 familyWilliam Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated the stupa and found the jewelsIn 1898, William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, where the Buddha is believed to have been born. \"courtesy: Sotheby'sThe jewels are considered among the most extraordinary archaeological finds of all timeHe writes his great-grandfather's \"technical diagrams of ramps and pulleys suggest that he was also a trained engineer who couldn't resist a project\".William Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V).

        "article_text": "Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. \nIn a message on his Truth Social site on Sunday, President Trump said that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\".\nThe reopening of Alcatraz - once notorious as one of the US's toughest prisons - would serve as a \"symbol of law, order, and justice,\" he said. \nLeading Democrats said the proposal was \"not a serious one\". The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and it is currently operating as a successful tourist site.\n\"Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,\" Trump wrote.\nThe prison would \"house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders\".\nPresident Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members there. He has also talked about sending \"homegrown criminals\" to foreign prisons. \nAlcatraz was originally a naval defence fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison. The Department of Justice took it over in the 1930s and it began taking in convicts from the federal prison system. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. \nThe prison was also made famous by the 1962 film, Birdman of Alcatraz, starring Burt Lancaster, about the convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who while serving a life sentence on the prison island developed an interest in birds and went on to become an expert ornithologist. \nIn 1979, the American biographical prison drama Escape from Alcatraz recounted a 1962 prisoner escape with Clint Eastwood starring as ringleader Frank Morris.\nIt was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz island. \nThe prison closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison website. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, largely due to its island location. \nIt would take an enormous amount of money to make Alcatraz into a functioning prison, Professor Gabriel Jack Chin from the Davis School of Law at the University of California told the BBC.  \nThe federal prison system is actually down about 25% from its peak population and \"there are a lot of empty beds\" in existing prisons, Chin said. \"So its not clear if a new one is needed.\"\nAlcatraz has \"a reputation as a tough prison\" and Trump is trying to send a message that his administration will be tough on crime, Chin added. \nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, said the proposal was \"not a serious one,\"  while the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, Scott Wiener, called the idea \"deeply unhinged\" in a post on Instagram and \"an attack on the rule of law.\"",

        "article_text": "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.\nHer numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.\n\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.\nBeing a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.\nThe teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?\nThis is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.\nBut music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".\n\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"\nSullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.\nSpeaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".\nShe added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.\nBlue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.\n\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.\nSullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".\nMany critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.\nTwigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".\n\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"\nNorth West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.\n\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.\nIn December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.\nThe cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"\nThe story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".\nIt was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.\nGwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".\nSimilarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".\nAlmost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".\nHudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.\nPam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"\nShe explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.\nAs fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",

On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right? \"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.Sullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".Many critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".ShutterstockBeyonc\u00e9 also brought out her youngest daughter Rumi on stage Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.Twigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".",

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "Leeds won 29 Championship games this season - more than any other side\nAn incredible Championship title race came to a fitting end on Saturday, running all the way into stoppage time before Leeds United finally pipped Burnley to the post.\nManor Solomon's last-gasp winner at relegated Plymouth Argyle meant Leeds matched the Clarets' win over play-off chasing Millwall, just as the home fans at Turf Moor were gearing up for an almighty party.\nBefore kick-off, Leeds knew it was in their hands, but in typical style, twists and turns followed.\nIt was an epic ending to what has statistically been the most closely-fought hunt for the title. \nFor the first time ever, two teams reached 100 points in the same Championship campaign, with Leeds' superior goal difference proving decisive.\nWith Birmingham City also finishing with 111 points in League One, it is the first time in the Football League's 137-year history that three sides have earned a century of points in the same campaign.\nLeeds seal title with late winner as Argyle go down\nBurnley beat Millwall but miss out on title\nChampionship: Leeds clinch title; Luton down, Coventry and Bristol City into play-offs\nPop star Natasha Bedingfield sang on the pitch after Burnley secured promotion\nBurnley had seen records tumble, including a Championship-best 30 clean sheets - equalling Port Vale's Football League record set in 1953-54 - and have conceded just 16 goals.\nThey have not lost at home all season, have been beaten only twice in the league, and have been unbeaten in 33 Championship games since losing at Millwall in November.\nIt seemed unlikely they would not return to the Premier League as champions, as manager Scott Parker admitted.\n\"If you'd have said to me you'd reach 100 points, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded and you wouldn't win the league I'd have said 'no chance',\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire, after adding a third promotion to his name after success with Fulham in 2020 and Bournemouth in 2022. \n\"We've done remarkably this year. I'm so proud. We came into today hoping it would go our way, but wanting to win the game and get to 100 points, We did that.\"\nMeanwhile, where Burnley have thrived as a defensive unit, Leeds shone in attack. With 95 goals, they were by some distance the top scorers in the division. Joel Piroe (19), Dan James (12) and Solomon (10) have all reached double figures this season.\n\"I can't put into words what I'm feeling right now. It is a dream come true to score the winning goal and take this Championship,\" an emotional Solomon told BBC Radio Leeds at full-time. \n\"Throughout the season we've shown we deserve this trophy and to finish in the first spot. I'm so glad it happened.\n\"We all knew what was happening at Burnley and we knew we needed to score. It paid off and the ball went into the net. It will take me a few days to digest what happened today, right now I'm going to celebrate.\"\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke (right) has won promotion from the Championship for the third time\nLike Parker, Leeds boss Daniel Farke has vast experience of getting out of the Championship. \nHe did so as champions with Norwich City in 2019 and 2021 and has now led the West Yorkshire club back to the Premier League after bouncing back from play-off final heartache against Southampton a year ago.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Of course I'm happy that we won this game in the final stages and are officially allowed to label ourselves as champions and the best team this season.\n\"It's an emotionally moving day because we have invested so much and wanted to crown ourselves with some silverware.\n\"It feels pretty, pretty special in the dressing room and I'm very happy for my players and staff, it means so much for them, and also our supporters.\"\nNobody should forget Sheffield United, either. Although four defeats in five games in April, including a loss at Burnley which ultimately knocked them out of contention for automatic promotion, proved fatal, the Blades led for long periods and looked the most likely.\nChris Wilder's side will need to go again in the play-offs, starting against Bristol City in the semi-finals. They have shown their readiness for the Premier League this season, finishing on 90 points, a tally which would have been enough to go up automatically in three of the previous six seasons.\nWhile that points to a more competitive top of the Championship than ever, successive seasons with all three promoted clubs coming down, including Burnley and the Blades, offers a stark warning too.\nA strong defensive unit will be crucial to hopes of survival, and Clarets captain Josh Brownhill, who also scored 18 goals, believes his team have a strong chance of improvement this time around.\n\"This is a different team, we look in really good shape to go up for next season and hopefully stay up. It is going to be difficult but we've worked hard on everything; our defensive record speaks for itself,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Credit to the staff and the fans but mainly the gaffer. He has worked harder than anybody. 100 points, unbeaten at home, unbeaten in 33 games, our defensive record has been exceptional.\"\nNever before have two teams accrued so many points in the same season at the top of the second tier. \nTheir consistency and strength of character laid the groundwork. Leeds held their nerve in the end, and right at the end, but ultimately, both they and Burnley can revel in achievements fit for the history books.",

Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.\nTrump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.\nThe administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content. \n\"The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,\" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \"It's still a big tariff.\"\nExecutives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs. \nGeneral Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.\nMercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.\nArt Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing. \n\"If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,\" he said.\nThe administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.\nTrump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.\n\"Everything is pretty good now,\" he said. \"I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.\"",

        "article_text": "Lando Norris won the Miami sprint race on Saturday before the qualifying session\nMiami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Date: 4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nMcLaren's Lando Norris said he was \"very happy\" after qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix, despite losing out on pole position to Max Verstappen.\nNorris ended up 0.065 seconds from the Red Bull driver and, while his satisfaction was mixed with some frustration, it was based on his feeling that he has made progress with some of the problems with which he has been struggling this season.\nThe Briton has been open about the fact he finds his McLaren car does not 'talk to him' in the way he would like when being pushed to the absolute limit on a qualifying lap.\nAnd while he again made a mistake that he felt cost him pole position, their communication has been better this weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium.\nNorris, who won Saturday's sprint race, said that \"Max did a Max lap once again and I can't fault him\". So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well.

So, while 99% of tariffs on India's exports to the UK will be eradicated, 85% of British exports will not be tariffed going to India.\nBut because British exports are so much higher value than Indian exports of clothing, footwear, and food, this should be worth \u00a315bn extra for British exports and \u00a310bn for India by 2040. This could change, though. For example, 88,000 cheaper Indian cars will now be able to be imported tariff free.\nThe UK government sees this as a win-win which helps exporters, creates jobs, and means lower prices for consumers.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. \nThe picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff. \nThe New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: \"I'd like to be Pope.\"\nTrump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida. \nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.\nThe image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. \n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,\" the group wrote.\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.\"\nLeft-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. \n\"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. \nBut the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.\n\"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nThe backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.\n\"It wasn't good,\" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. \"I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.\"\nSwitching to Italian, he called it a \"brutta figura\", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.\nAsked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - \"who knows\" and declined to speak more about it.",

        "article_text": "Labor's Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called \"incumbency curse\" to be re-elected Australia's prime minister in a landslide.\nOfficial vote counting won't finish for days, but Albanese's centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.\n\"Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need,\" Albanese said.\nCoalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted \"full responsibility\" for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs.\nFollowing the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.\nCost-of-living concerns - particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing - dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.  \nDutton was seen by many as Australia's Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration. \nLabor has seen swings towards them right across the country \u2013 a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia - and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.\nThe party's success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.\nLabor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.\nThat represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most \"teal\" independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.\nIt's a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albanese's popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.\nIn his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the election's key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy. \nHe reiterated his promises to make healthcare - most critically GP appointments - more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.\nNotably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: \"We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\"\nIt's a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albanese's tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.\nAustralia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.\nThe Voice was one of Albanese's most defining policies, and his most striking setback - it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.\nIndigenous Australians have told the BBC  they feel like they've been forgotten by policymakers since.\nThe prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.\nWith tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the \"incumbency curse\" \u2013 a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.\nDutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback - he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.\nIt has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University  Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: \"Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.\"\nInstead tonight Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labor's Ali France.\n\"I love this country and have fought hard for it,\" he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.\n\"We have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.\"\nHis campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameraman's head.\n\"The opposition has been shambolic,\" Prof Warhurst says.\nBut the government - while resolute and disciplined in its campaign - was timid. It's strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.\nAnd that's something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.\nWhile the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.\nLast election, analysts and some of the party's own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton \u2013 a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man \u2013 was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.\nAfter a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are \"Trumpian\" politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again \u2013 and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.\n\"We have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review... we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election,\" former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.\nBut meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.\nAlbanese's \"incumbency curse\" turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.\nLabor struck a \"middle-of-the-road path\" with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.\n\"That was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: 'Will Labor actually do something with power?'\"",

She last performed in Brazil in 2012.\nSome fans - known as Gaga's \"Little Monsters\" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.\nA massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event. \nLady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.\n\n\"You waited for me, you waited for more than 10 years for me,\" an emotional Lady Gaga told the crowds as she unfurled a Brazilian flag.  \n\"Brazil, I'm ready. I'm going to give it my all.\"\nThe pop star appeared in Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team. \nThousands sang along with her best known hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra, creating an electric atmosphere as many waved rainbow-themed fans and watched on huge screens along the beach. \nFans travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance.  \nOne man, 28-year-old Luan Messias, said he spent all night on a bus from Itanhaem in neighbouring Sao Paulo state.\nAlisha Duarte, 22, told AFP news agency she started queuing at 0740 in the morning. \"Lady Gaga is worth it! It's going to get super crowded, but we'll survive,\" she said. \nAnother fan, Paulo Oliveira, explained why people were so excited about the concert. She \"tells us that we can be who we are, that we can be different and that being different is cool,\" he told Reuters. \nIt's going to be an \"unforgettable show\", concert attendee Lai Borges told Reuters on her way in. \"It's going to be emotional and I'm going to cry a lot,\" she said. \nAs the event drew to a close, Lady Gaga told the audience - in a reference to the nickname for Lady Gaga fans - \"we are monsters and monsters never die,\" and she brought the concert to a close with Bad Romance, perhaps her most famous song.",

        "article_text": "Rangers have performed well against Celtic but slipped up far too often to challenge their old rivals for the Scottish Premiership crown\nThe angst of a football manager's life was writ large over Barry Ferguson's contorted frame in the dying seconds of the last Old Firm derby of the season.\nA Rangers throw-in down the Celtic end and an opportunity for James Tavernier to hurl one towards the box in the hope of something happening to turn a 1-1 draw into a win.\nInstead, Hamza Igamane gets it and flings it back towards his own goal, whereupon Rangers are mugged and Celtic are away. Daizen Maeda, their principal goalscorer all season, is scampering into the Rangers penalty area - and Ferguson is practically jumping out of his own skin in frustration.\nGesticulating madly, he's like a man who's been given electric shock treatment. From the gantry up above, you could almost feel his pain.\nCeltic blew that moment, of course, but in real time you'd have bet money on Maeda picking out Johnny Kenny for a fairly routine tap-in winner. \nAt least Ferguson and the Rangers fans were spared that misery and the industrial-scale mocking that would have followed. The smallest mercy towards the end of a largely merciless season.\nFerguson retains hope of keeping Rangers head coach role\nRangers condemn 'unacceptable' banner and throwing of bottle\nIdah's Celtic equaliser leaves Rangers without home win in seven\nIn the wake of Philippe Clement's demise, Ferguson and his coaches - Billy Dodds, Neil McCann and Allan McGregor - were sent into Ibrox as some kind of survival experts, but it hasn't worked. Too many ills, too much damage done before they arrived, too little time to work on a solution.\nYou sense Ferguson has dedicated all his waking hours to this cause, that he's emptied himself into the role with abandon. He's spoken brilliantly, he's sent out all the right messages, he's practically tattooed the word BELIEVE on his forehead in an attempt to drag his players out their torpor.\nIt's not been enough to address the bizarre contradictions at the heart of this team, a gang of players with a twin personality; confident and dangerous against good teams, afflicted by uncertainty and impotence against supposedly inferior opposition.\nRangers have gone away to Fenerbahce and won a Europa League match but have been knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Queen's Park, the eighth-best team in the Championship.\nUnder Ferguson, they've beaten Brendan Rodgers' runaway champions in their own backyard at Celtic Park (scoring three times) and yet they've lost at home to Queen's Park, St Mirren and Motherwell (scoring once), though only the latter fixture was on Ferguson's watch.\nThey reached the last eight in Europe but haven't won in seven games at Ibrox. They've lost one in four in the league against Celtic, but they're 17 points behind them. They've outscored Celtic 7-6 in Old Firm games, but Celtic can't even see them in their rear-view mirror.\nAcross the span of the league, Rangers' record against Celtic is markedly better than their record against St Mirren, who are sixth. They've dropped as many points against Hibernian, Aberdeen and Motherwell as they have against Rodgers' serial league winners. Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham Hotspur only got a draw against them in Europe. Seven different domestic teams (including cup ties) have beaten them.\nThe fans have repeatedly turned on Cyriel Dessers, who has now scored 25 goals this season and has 47 goals in 107 games, while giving little of the same kind of vitriol to Danilo, who they signed for \u00a36m for a return (when fit) of 12 in 46.\nVery little of this makes sense. Not for the first time this season, we can borrow Winston Churchill's words to describe this utter basket case: \"A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\"\nBarry Ferguson harbours ambitions of taking on the Rangers managerial position on a permanent basis\nRangers were combative on Sunday, as predicted. They were fired up and, at times, threatening. Nothing about that was surprising. They scored first. Again, it wasn't a shock-horror moment. They've now taken the lead in four Old Firm games in a row.\nThe puzzle about how they can look pretty coherent in these games and look so bereft in others remains unsolved. Yes, they have more freedom to play when up against strong opposition who don't resort to the low block to frustrate them, but that only goes a certain part of the way in explaining the vast disparity in performances.\nHow can you go toe-to-toe with the likely Europa League finalists Spurs and Manchester United  - scoring in both, drawing one and losing the other to a late, late goal - and yet fall in a goalless heap against teams with a fraction of your playing resources and questionable defensive records?\nAt their worst this season, Rangers have lacked nous, steel, pace, leadership, creativity, goals from midfield, apart from Vaclav Cerny, and goals from a striker other than Dessers.\nAll four of Celtic's starting defenders on Sunday have scored more times this season than Conor Barron, who's on zero. Liam Scales, a centre-half, has as many as Nico Raskin, a defensive midfielder.\nOf the XIs who began at Ibrox, Rangers had two players in double figures for the season, Celtic had five - and that was with Nicolas Kuhn injured and Kyogo Furuhashi sold. Luke McCowan, an unused substitute on the day, has scored more goals than seven of Rangers' outfield starters.\nDespite all of this, they can live with Celtic on any given day. They just can't live with the pressure of should-win and must-win games.\nWe're told none of this is lost on the prospective new owners. They know the team and its foibles, they know the Scottish landscape and who dominates it, they know the distance they must travel across some rocky terrain and they know every inch of progress is going to be hard-won.\nRangers are capable of flash-in-the-pan performances, like Sunday and the other ones that went before against Celtic, but there's an empty feeling, an irrelevance when you suspect their next slip is just days away.\nUnbeaten, but still bowed, Rangers folk will want to go to sleep now and wake only when the new owners are in and making the kind of profound change that's required.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.\n\"Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).\"\nOne former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.\n\"There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,\" they told the BBC.\nM&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.\nAs a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.\n\"They will be literally working 24/7.

Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.\n\"I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.\"\nGreencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.\nM&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.\nOne food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.\n\"The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.\"\nBut he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.\nGed Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.\n\"If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.\"\nBut the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.\nThe company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.\nThe chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was \"imperative\" to understand what had happened.\nOne person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.\n\"Say nothing until you know everything.

        "article_text": "Bayern's 'James Bond' - how Kane clinched his first trophy\nFor all the goals and individual accolades, Harry Kane has long been hit with criticism - that he had never won a trophy with club or country.\n\"There are many people who, throughout my career, only talk about the fact I haven't won a title yet,\" the England captain said recently, as Bayern Munich's Bundesliga crown began to look more inevitable. \"It would be nice to silence a few of them.\"\nKane even saw the irony in the fact his 15-year wait for a senior trophy might end while he watched on from the stands as Bayern faced RB Leipzig on Saturday, having been handed a one-game suspension following his fifth yellow card of the season last week.\n\"It's kind of my story that I'll miss the Leipzig game,\" said the 31-year-old. \"But no worries, I'll celebrate more than anyone else.\"\nKane even made his way to the touchline ready to join the party until a stoppage-time Leipzig leveller meant the wait was delayed by a day when second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Freiburg on Sunday.\nThat saw Vincent Kompany's side secure the German title, and means Kane has finally put to rest the notion that a glittering individual career may finish without any silverware.\nThe striker had been following the Leverkusen game with fellow England international Eric Dier and the rest of their Bayern team-mates, and posted a video on social media of them singing \"we are the champions\" after the title was confirmed.\n\"What a night, and what a celebration with the players and staff,\" Kane said in a video posted to his social media channels.\n\"I'm sure everyone is feeling it a little bit this morning. But we are here and I feel amazing.\n\"It's been a long time coming. Obviously a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication. It just feels sweet to win the title and the first one of my career.\n\"I appreciate all the support as always, it never goes unnoticed and I can't wait to enjoy these next couple of weeks. I can't wait to be at Allianz Arena on Saturday to celebrate in front of the fans.\"\n\"I'm thrilled for him because he deserves it so much,\" former Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jurgen Klinsmann told BBC Sport.\n\"He has proven it throughout the last 10 years. His numbers are absolutely insane and he will do that for another couple of years because he's in top shape still, he's fit, he's hungry.\n\"I'm really happy for him. I just love to watch him.\"\nHarry Kane's debut ended in defeat by RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup\nKane's career has not followed the trajectory one might expect for England's all-time record goalscorer. As an under-14s player at Tottenham, according to former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe, he \"wasn't even on the podium\" when it came to the age-group's top talents.\nHe was still a youth player the last time Spurs won a trophy, the League Cup in 2008, but earned his breakthrough with the first-team squad and signed his first professional deal in July 2010. Then there were hard-grafting loan spells with Leyton Orient in League One and in the Championship with Millwall and Leicester, as well as with Norwich in the Premier League.\nOnce Kane established himself at White Hart Lane, he blossomed into Spurs' best homegrown player of a generation, becoming the club's all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 games and climbing to second in the Premier League ranks with 213, behind only Alan Shearer's 260.\nYet for all the goals, and three Premier League Golden Boots, a decade in lilywhite yielded only a series of near-misses - a Champions League final defeat by Liverpool, twice runners-up in the League Cup and beaten to the title in successive seasons by Leicester and Chelsea.\nThat story repeated itself with England, as they were runners-up at the past two European Championships and beaten in the 2018 World Cup semi-final by Croatia, despite Kane winning the Golden Boot in Russia seven years ago and finishing as joint top-scorer at last summer's Euros.\n\"I always said that if Harry leaves Spurs, he will get the opportunity to win titles,\" added Klinsmann, who also won his only league championship after leaving Tottenham for Bayern in 1995.\nIndeed, trophies seemed like a foregone conclusion when Kane joined Bayern for an initial 100m euros (\u00a386.4m) in August 2023 - a club who had won 11 successive Bundesliga titles before his arrival.\nKane even had a shot at silverware on his debut, but Bayern lost 3-0 to RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup at Allianz Arena with the England captain coming off the bench for the final half hour.\nWas he cursed? When Bayern were then knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken, some may have believed so.\nLeverkusen ran away with the league as Bayern finished third, their lowest position since 2011, while Thomas Tuchel's side were beaten by eventual winners Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals.\n\"People made bad jokes about him,\" explained Taufig Khalil, commentator for ARD Radio.\n\"Bayern Munich won the German championship 11 years in a row, Harry Kane came for 100m-plus and the next season Bayern Munich did not win a single trophy!\n\"It was tough for him. He came to Munich because he knew this is the club where you can win trophies, where you will be on top. And then he came and it was a very bad season last year.\"\nHarry Kane enjoys Munich's Oktoberfest\nKane never wavered in his desire to keep improving after becoming the Bundesliga's record signing. He spoke recently about studying the game's greats and having the drive to consistently be one of the world's best.\nHe has dealt with the pressure of essentially replacing Robert Lewandowski, who left in 2022 as Bayern's second all-time scorer behind Gerd Muller.\n\"Bayern Munich has a huge tradition of number nines,\" explained Klinsmann.\n\"There is always a special eye on them. To fill that spot is just an honour. It's something very special. He knows that he is followed closely by everyone.\"\nAnd not just in Munich - Khalil said rival fans see it as a privilege to have Kane in Germany: \"When the captain of the Three Lions is playing in the Bundesliga - wow, that's big!\"\nYet there is no superstar ego on boy from east London.\nHe is regarded as incredibly professional and a leader among the squad - a player a lot of his younger team-mates look up to and someone who is very respectful, whether that be in training or completing the many media and partner obligations that come with representing a European giant like Bayern.\n\"He has a royal approach,\" added Khalil. \"When he enters the stadium, he greets everybody, he is very friendly. If there is a moment he doesn't want to talk in the mixed zone, then he excuses himself. A lot of other players walk through with headphones on or use the telephone and try not to look in the eyes of the media.\n\"Normally he stops, he is always ready to talk. He is an absolutely leading person in that club. He gives a lot of that James Bond gratitude - he is the striker with the licence to score!\"\nKane has thrown himself into life in Munich, embracing the culture, trips to Oktoberfest, visiting supporters' clubs and taking German lessons, even if he has previously joked his kids will learn the language before him.\n\"What he's done extremely well is adapt to Bavaria with so much ease,\" said Klinsmann. \"He became part of the lifestyle, the city and his family just fit into the way of life there.\n\"It's an international place, Munich, so it's not too problematic but still, you've got to go to another country and keep your work-rate at the highest level while figuring out that your family are comfortable and having a good time.\"\nHe is popular, too. Kane quickly struck up a friendship with Bayern's all-time leading appearance-maker Thomas Muller, who will leave at the end of the season, and is known to play golf with the Germany forward and midfielder Konrad Laimer, among others.\nNaturally, he is also good friends with former Spurs team-mate Eric Dier, another player well-liked throughout the squad, with both England internationals regarded as being important to team chemistry at Bayern.\n\"The people love him,\" added Klinsmann. \"He is just himself. He is humble and down to earth. He focuses on what is important and for him, that is scoring goals.\"\nEric Dier joined England team-mate Harry Kane at Bayern in January 2024\nAfter six final defeats - three with Spurs, two with England and one with Bayern - the humble yet ruthless goal-getter's perseverance has paid off.\nKane's first German title is Bayern Munich's 34th, but there can be no doubting the Englishman's importance to Kompany's side.\n\"It helps when you have a top player who wants to run and fight for the team like a youth player,\" said the former Manchester City and Belgium captain. \"I played against him as an opponent and he has become better with age.\"\nKane is the division's top scorer with 24 goals and has 36 in all competitions this season, having scored 11 in the Champions League.\nThat was a competition in which Bayern were desperate to reach the final at their home stadium in Munich, but Kane missed a big chance in the quarter-final first leg against Inter and, despite scoring in the return in Milan, they were knocked out.\n\"At the end, we talked with him and he said, 'yeah, everybody is right to expect me to make that goal, I didn't do it, that's fate,'\" said Khalil, shrugging off critics who suggest Kane does not score in \"big games\".\n\"Whenever there are bad moments, after the match, in the mixed zone, Harry walks through and he stops, he is talking, he accepts the situation.\"\nBayern were also knocked out of the German Cup by Leverkusen, but in the Bundesliga - bar a brief wobble in March when they lost at home to lowly Bochum - Kompany's side, with Kane at its heart, have led from the front.\nHis form during this title run is a continuation of what began in his debut season, where he netted 36 times - only Gerd Muller and Lewandowski have scored more in a single Bundesliga campaign.\n\"The team clicks well with the players around him,\" said Klinsmann. \"He plays in a system that he's getting fed by attacking midfielders.\n\"He's extremely important to the Bayern side and he's done a fantastic job from day one.\"\nIn April, he became the fastest player to hit 60 goals in the competition, doing so in 60 appearances to break Erling Haaland's record by five games. He also registered 15 assists in that time to average a goal involvement every 72 minutes.\n\"He fights, he works, he scores an incredible number of goals,\" added Bayern's honorary president Uli Hoeness. \"No-one deserves it more than him.\"\nHarry Kane reached 60 Bundesliga goals in as many games, the fastest player to do so\nKhalil believes more trophies will follow for Kane, and Bayern's focus will soon switch to winning the Fifa Club World Cup in the United States this summer. \n\"The moment Bayern Munich went out of the Champions League, they started to talk about the Club World Cup,\" he said. \"It's another big trophy, an international trophy, and they would make a lot of money.\"\nThat could play a role in Kane's future and whether Bayern can afford to add widely linked, but expensive, target Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen.\n\"Everybody wants him to stay,\" said Khalil, with Kane's contract running until 2027.\n\"The question is, would Florian Wirtz together with Jamal Musiala, the two German youngsters playing side by side, work with a central box striker and how much money do you want to spend on Harry Kane for next season?\n\"For me, that's stupid, I definitely see him next year in the Bundesliga. They have to find another way to finance Florian Wirtz.\n\"I think we will see Harry Kane for at least another year.\"\nAdditional reporting by Charlotte Coates.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

The Saints again held firm against the maul but after illegal defence, Leinster were able to score through Caelan Doris off a tap penalty. \nThe Leinster and Ireland skipper followed his try with a 50:22 of his own soon after but again his side could not execute the line-out maul. \nSmith's second penalty pushed his side out to an eight-point lead but, with 20 minutes remaining, replacement Ryan Baird won the penalty and line-out that preceded Van der Flier's second score. \nAgain, though, the Saints produced a stout response. Only two minutes later, full-back James Ramm picked a brilliant line and was over in the corner.\nThe Saints' efforts to see out the victory were hampered when blind-side flanker Josh Kemeny was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Rabah Slimani. \nWith 10 minutes to go, James Lowe halved the deficit as Leinster scored their second of the day from a well-worked tap penalty and Prendergast added the extras to bring his side within three. \nThe Saints again relied upon their stout maul defence but, as the clock showed 79 minutes, Leinster were awarded a penalty with Alex Coles sent to the sin-bin just as time expired on Kemeny's yellow.\nLeinster again went for the tap but the 14 men of Northampton turned them over on the line to complete a famous win. \nLeinster: Keenan; O'Brien, Ringrose, Henshaw, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Healy, Sheehan, Furlong, Snyman, McCarthy, Deegan, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\nReplacements: Kelleher, Porter, Slimani, Baird, Conan, McGrath, R Byrne, Barrett.\nNorthampton Saints: Ramm; Freeman, Dingwall (capt), Hutchinson, Litchfield; Smith, Mitchell; Iyogun, Langdon, Davison, Mayanavanua, Coles, Kemeny, Pollock, Augustus.\nReplacements: Walker, West, Millar Mills, Lockett, Munga, Scott-Young, James, Seabrook.\nYellow cards: Langdon, Kemeny, Coles\nReferee: Pierre Brousset (France)",

Last year, we were waiting to see what Leinster were going to do.\n\"We showed up today and the first 20 minutes, we punched them in the face. They weren't really expecting that. Credit to the boys, we got the result.\"\nConfidence in Leinster reaching a fourth consecutive final from fans and pundits alike was well-founded.\nThe Irish province pitched up at their vociferous Dublin home without having conceded a point in thumping knockout victories over Harlequins and United Rugby Championship title-holders Glasgow Warriors.\nSaints, though, had not read the script. \nEngland wing Tommy Freeman scored a first-half hat-trick to extend his tally to seven tries in three Champions Cup appearances and further strengthen his claim for British and Irish Lions selection, while Henry Pollock's star continues to rise after his searing try.\nThe hosts responded after half-time, but, somewhat uncharacteristically, lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead, while Saints were able to negate Leinster's blitz defence once more as James Ramm scored their fifth try.\nIreland wing James Lowe dragged his side to within three points to set up a thrilling finale but, after referee Pierre Brousset awarded Leinster a late penalty instead of a try, Northampton salvaged possession with a last-gasp turnover camped on their own line before kicking the ball dead.\nSaints director of rugby Phil Dowson was a member of the playing squad the last time the club overcame Leinster in 2013, but the former back row's masterminding of their latest victory is perhaps the greatest of his coaching career.\n\"Lots of people wrote us off and we understood we were underdogs but the belief within the group was outstanding,\" Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton. \n\"I would hate to think what my blood pressure was doing at the end but the last defensive set spoke volumes about our group, about the lads coming on and their impact. We got the turnover, killed the clock and cue the wild scenes in the coaching box.\n\"We have had experience before of playing into a press defence. We had practised playing through it and we revisited those principles. There were more opportunities we could've taken but we took enough to get on the scoresheet.\"\nNorthampton stun Leinster in Dublin to reach final\nWhen is the British and Irish Lions squad named?\nSaints' biggest test remains against either Bordeaux-Begles or six-time winners Toulouse in this season's showpiece in Cardiff, but if this victory underlines Dowson's era so far, his greatest servant could yet prove to be the influential Pollock, who is still remarkably in his debut campaign as a senior player.\nThe young back row, 20, has broken into Northampton's side, made his England Test debut and is a contender for Lions selection just 12 months on from watching last season's defeat at Croke Park in fancy dress as a supporter. \n\"That was a battle. I have never played in a game that hard in my life,\" Pollock told Premier Sports.\n\"That is what dreams are made of. \n\"As a boy I grew up watching this competition and to get to the final with my boyhood club, I'm emotional speaking about it. \n\"After the last two performances these Leinster boys had, to come here with no fear, we have been saying all week, 'Why not us?'.\"\nPollock's all-round performance belied his level of experience, while his try demonstrated the physical prowess of a back as he launched on to Mitchell's flat pass from a standing start to glide through a hole in Leinster's defence, before sprinting around final defender Sam Prendergast.\nAsked about applying two fingers to his neck in celebration, an enthused Pollock added: \"I was just feeling that pulse. \n\"This is why you play the game, because you love it.

A number of Indian passports were found near where the boat washed up on a beach, news agency Reuters reported.\nFour of those found have been taken to hospital. It is not known if anyone else entered the water.\nThe coast guard said on Tuesday that seven people from the boat remained missing, but that it had suspended its search \"pending further developments\".\nSearch and rescue efforts by air and sea had continued for nearly 28 hours, covering more than 520 sq nautical miles, the agency said.\nIt was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles (56km) north of the Mexico border, Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told the Associated Press news agency. \nHe said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. \"They were not tourists,\" Mr Sappey said. \"They are believed to be migrants.\"\nA panga boat is a small, open lightweight vessel typically powered by an outboard motor. \nA coastguard cutter and a helicopter were searching for the missing, a spokesman told the BBC. \nNick Backouris, a lieutenant with the San Diego Sheriff's office, said people from his office helped victims on the beach.\n\"A doctor hiking nearby called in and said, 'I see people doing CPR on the beach, I'm running that way,'\" Backouris told AP. \"The deputies were assisting with life-saving measures.\"\nJorge Sanchez, of the Encinitas Fire Department, said the immigration status of those caught was not known.

        "article_text": "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\". \nThe strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.\nPakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. \nIslamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. \nThis sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.  \nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nExperts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.\nIndia says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. \nAmong the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. \nThe deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. \nPakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.\n\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.  \n\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.\nThe India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.\nAjay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".\n\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nIndian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".\n\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.\n\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\" \nThe majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.\n\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.\n\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"\nPakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".\nDr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.\n\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".\nChristopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.\n\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.  \n\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.\nDespite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.\n\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.\nHowever, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.\nExperts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.\n\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.\n\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"\nDr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.\n\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.\n\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.\n\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"\nIndia is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. \nShortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.\nThis mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. \nThe crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week.",

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

        "article_text": "Nothing has convinced Sabine Zetteler of the value of using AI.\n\"I read a really great phrase recently that said something along the lines of 'why would I bother to read something someone couldn't be bothered to write' and that is such a powerful statement and one that aligns absolutely with my views.\"\nMs Zetteler runs her own London-based communications agency, with around 10 staff, some full-time some part-time.\n\"What's the point of sending something we didn't write, reading a newspaper written by bots, listening to a song created by AI, or me making a bit more money by sacking my administrator who has four kids?\n\"Where's the joy, love or aspirational betterment even just for me as a founder in that? It means nothing to me,\" she says.\nMs Zetteler is among those resisting the AI invasion, which really got going with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022.\nSince then the service, and its many rivals have become wildly popular. ChatGPT is racking up over five billion visits a month, according to software firm Semrush.\nBut training AI systems like ChatGPT requires huge amounts of energy and, once trained, keeping them running is also energy intensive. \nWhile it's difficult to quantify the electricity used by AI, a report by Goldman Sachs estimated that a ChatGPT query uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query.\nThat makes some people uncomfortable.\nFor Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, the environmental impact is one reason why she vows to stay away from AI.\n\"My initial reaction was that AI is soulless and is a contradiction with my business, which is all about human connection,\" says Achery, based in London.\n\"However, I found out that the environmental impact was awful with all the energy consumption required to run the data centres. I don't think that people are aware of that.\"\nWhile Ms Zetteler admits she respects AI for all the social-good it can achieve, she says she's concerned about the wider impact on society.\n\"I'm happy that AI exists for blind people if they can have articles translated by AI and anything that is truly beneficial. But in general, I don't think it will benefit us long-term.\"\nIs she worried it might have a knock-on effect on her business, especially if rival companies are using AI?\n\"Like everything, I could save money by sending our agency to Milan on EasyJet flights rather than the train.\n\"Already my profit margins look unsuccessful if that's how you measure success, but how about if you measure success by how much you're contributing to society and how well you sleep?\"\nSierra Hansen, who lives in Seattle and works in public affairs, also refuses to use AI. For her, she's concerned that the use of AI is harming our ability to problem solve.\n\"Our brain is the thing that helps organise what our days look like, not going to AI Copilot and asking it to tell it how to manage my schedule.\n\"Our job as a human is to apply critical thinking skills, and if you are feeding simple tasks into ChatGPT then you're not solving on your own. It's doing the thinking for you. If I want to listen to music, I don't need AI to create the perfect punk rock album for me.\"\nBut not everyone has the luxury of opting out of AI.\nJackie Adams (not her real name), who works in digital marketing, resisted AI initially on environmental grounds, and because she thought using it was lazy.\n\"I heard about the energy needed to power data centres and the amount land they take up, and it didn't sit right with me. I didn't understand why we needed it,\" she says.\nHowever, about a year ago her three colleagues at the marketing firm she works for started adopting AI, for tasks such as copywriting and idea generation.\nSix months ago Ms Adams had to follow them, after being told she had to cut her budget.\n\"Then it was out my control,\" she says. She feels that continuing to resist would have hurt her career.\n\"I started playing with it a bit more after reading job descriptions asking for AI experience. I recently realised that if I don't implement it into my ways of working, I'm going to get left behind.\"\nNow, she says, she doesn't view tapping into AI as laziness anymore.\n\"It can elevate my work and make some things better,\" adding that she uses it to refine copywriting work and for editing photos.\nThe moment to opt out of AI has already passed, says James Brusseau, a philosophy professor specialising in AI ethics at Pace University in New York.\n\"If you want to know why a decision is made, we will need humans. If we don't care about that, then we will probably use AI,\" he says.\n\"So, we will have human judges for criminal cases, and human doctors to make decisions about who should get the transplant. But, weather forecasting will be gone soon, and anesthesiology too,\" says Prof Brusseau.\nMs Adam has accepted using AI at work, but she still feels despondent about AI's growing influence.\n\"Even when you do a Google search it includes an AI overview, while some emails have a topline summary, So now it almost feels like we have no control. How do I turn all that off? It's snowballing.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK? Sign up here.",

        "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.\nHe believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.\nSir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"\nThe ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.\nA blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.\nA host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.\nToby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.\nThe film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.\nSir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"\nSince then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.\nOcean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.\nThe new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. The trawlers are often after a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.\n\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.\nThe process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.  \nSir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".\nSir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.\nIt is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.\nJust one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"\nBut in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.\nOne of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"\nDespite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"\nSir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.\nHe believes that could be transformational. \n\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"\nA healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.\n\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.\nAs he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.\nOcean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.\nThere's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.\nSo what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?\nTo count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.\nFor someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.\nShe says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.\nRestricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"\nBut what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?\nMs Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.\nThey found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"\nAnd it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".\nBut - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.\nMs Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?\nThe definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.\n\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"\nBut the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.\nThe eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.\nAnother subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.\nToday, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.\nThe autism net has been cast wider.\nOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.\nStudies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.\nIt's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.\n\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"\nMs Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.\nShe says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".\nBecause autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nNow we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.\nShe says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.\nThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.\n\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"\nThere's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.\nFor Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.\nThe 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"\nShe says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"\nHer autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.\nBut others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.\nA focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".\nAs the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.\nThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.\nThe internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.\nDisproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.\nBut, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nIs there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?\nGinny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.\n\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"\nShe also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".\nBut Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.\n\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"\nYou can listen to The Autism Curve on BBC Sounds now",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. \nThe picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff. \nThe New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: \"I'd like to be Pope.\"\nTrump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida. \nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.\nThe image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. \n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,\" the group wrote.\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.\"\nLeft-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. \n\"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. \nBut the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.\n\"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nThe backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.\n\"It wasn't good,\" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. \"I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.\"\nSwitching to Italian, he called it a \"brutta figura\", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.\nAsked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - \"who knows\" and declined to speak more about it.",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead \"accountable\".\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nPakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims. \nPakistan's military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 26 people were killed and 46 injured. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" is false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists visiting the region.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it. \nBut Indian police have alleged two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacked by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN chief Antonio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments.",

I'm so proud. We came into today hoping it would go our way, but wanting to win the game and get to 100 points, We did that.\"\nMeanwhile, where Burnley have thrived as a defensive unit, Leeds shone in attack. With 95 goals, they were by some distance the top scorers in the division. Joel Piroe (19), Dan James (12) and Solomon (10) have all reached double figures this season.\n\"I can't put into words what I'm feeling right now. It is a dream come true to score the winning goal and take this Championship,\" an emotional Solomon told BBC Radio Leeds at full-time. \n\"Throughout the season we've shown we deserve this trophy and to finish in the first spot. I'm so glad it happened.\n\"We all knew what was happening at Burnley and we knew we needed to score. It paid off and the ball went into the net. It will take me a few days to digest what happened today, right now I'm going to celebrate.\"\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke (right) has won promotion from the Championship for the third time\nLike Parker, Leeds boss Daniel Farke has vast experience of getting out of the Championship. \nHe did so as champions with Norwich City in 2019 and 2021 and has now led the West Yorkshire club back to the Premier League after bouncing back from play-off final heartache against Southampton a year ago.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Of course I'm happy that we won this game in the final stages and are officially allowed to label ourselves as champions and the best team this season.\n\"It's an emotionally moving day because we have invested so much and wanted to crown ourselves with some silverware.\n\"It feels pretty, pretty special in the dressing room and I'm very happy for my players and staff, it means so much for them, and also our supporters.\"\nNobody should forget Sheffield United, either. Although four defeats in five games in April, including a loss at Burnley which ultimately knocked them out of contention for automatic promotion, proved fatal, the Blades led for long periods and looked the most likely.\nChris Wilder's side will need to go again in the play-offs, starting against Bristol City in the semi-finals. They have shown their readiness for the Premier League this season, finishing on 90 points, a tally which would have been enough to go up automatically in three of the previous six seasons.\nWhile that points to a more competitive top of the Championship than ever, successive seasons with all three promoted clubs coming down, including Burnley and the Blades, offers a stark warning too.\nA strong defensive unit will be crucial to hopes of survival, and Clarets captain Josh Brownhill, who also scored 18 goals, believes his team have a strong chance of improvement this time around.\n\"This is a different team, we look in really good shape to go up for next season and hopefully stay up. It is going to be difficult but we've worked hard on everything; our defensive record speaks for itself,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Credit to the staff and the fans but mainly the gaffer. He has worked harder than anybody. 100 points, unbeaten at home, unbeaten in 33 games, our defensive record has been exceptional.\"\nNever before have two teams accrued so many points in the same season at the top of the second tier. \nTheir consistency and strength of character laid the groundwork. Leeds held their nerve in the end, and right at the end, but ultimately, both they and Burnley can revel in achievements fit for the history books.",

        "article_text": "The Italian island immediately conjures up grand bougainvillea-draped villas and a whitewashed city centre, lined by luxury boutiques. But that's \u2013 literally \u2013 only half of the story.\n\"Bring water,\" they said when I announced I'd be hiking the Sentiero dei Fortini (Trail of Little Forts). \"There's nothing out there.\"\nThe six-kilometre cliffside path linking the remains of three 19th-Century Bourbon military outposts was my fourth hike on this craggy Mediterranean island. Somewhere along the rocky, wild rosemary-flocked path while dodging spiky prickly pears, I realised that I'd only seen one other human in two hours. And there were indeed no water sources, aside from a rustic fountain I'd encountered a kilometre back at Fort M\u00e8sola.\nMy Google Maps sputtered. I'd already got lost twice before noting that the ceramic path markers were low to the ground, cataloguing the area's flora and fauna \u2013 fig trees and wildflowers, wall lizards and falcons. The terrain faded from wilderness to sheer crags. Finally at the last fort, Fort Orrico, I could see straight down to the sea; a 30m death drop. The islands of Ischia and Procida loomed in the Gulf of Naples like the humps of petrified sea monsters. And I was completely alone at the island's edge; triumphant.\nThis is Capri. But perhaps not as you imagine it.\nTypically, the word Capri conjures up bougainvillea-draped villas and luxury boutique-lined streets; a yacht dock for the glitterati and the perpetual artists' muse. Paul Feig's Another Simple Favor, which premiered on 1 May on Prime Video, is the latest film set against the island's opulent hotel culture and majestic cliffs, and is sure to inspire a fresh slew of Capri travel dreams.\nBut in Capri, glamour is \u2013 literally \u2013 only half of the story.\nThe camel-humped Capri \u2013 one of Italy's three volcanic Phlegrean islands \u2013 is actually home to two distinct towns. At the eastern end lies the princess Capri Town where loafer-wearing VIPs sip espresso in Piazza Umberto I; the \u00a0faraglioni sea stacks winking in the distance. And at Capri's western end is her rugged little sister, the township of Anacapri; a sea cliff and prickly pear paradise where hiking boots replace stilettos and wild outdoorsy adventures trump wild nightlife.\nTip:\nWhile Anacapri remains the island's outdoorsy paradise, Capri Town does have a few woodsy experiences of its own. Just push past the tourists and strike out from Piazza Umberto I or Via Camerelle towards the Punta Tragara lookout and the passeggiata del Pizzolungo. This clifftop trek offers incredible views of the faraglioni, passing the Arco Naturale \u2013 a Neolithic arch \u2013 and the Grotta di Matermania, the site of pagan rituals to the Goddess Mitra. Reward yourself with lunch at Le Grottelle for rustic island dishes and mesmerising Gulf views.\nBut while Capri sees as many as 16,000 visitors a day \u2013 outnumbering the 12,900 full-time residents \u2013 the majority only visit Capri Town.\n\"There's two main reasons for this,\" surmises Camilla Formisano, copyeditor at Caprionline. \"Time and imagination. Seventy to 80% of visitors arrive on organised excursions from Naples, Sorrento or cruise ships. So they visit the most famous, easily accessible places from the port, like Piazza Umberto I.\"\nFormisano also believes that social media plays a part: \"People see the faraglioni and the piazza and think, 'I saw Capri'. Social media has condensed the island into a single postcard.\"\nSocial media is merely Capri Town's latest PR rep. Before becoming a premier Italian bucket list destination, Capri was a humble fishing island. It was settled by the Ancient Greeks, later becoming the seaside retreat of the Roman emperor Tiberius, who left grand villas in his wake. It wasn't until centuries later, when the Romantic poets and then Hollywood filmmakers turned their artistic eye on Capri Town, that it became a VIP haven. Today, visitors spill out from the ferry and throng the bus and funicular ticket booths to jockey for place in Piazza Umberto I, dodging motorised luggage carts and women in Instagrammable sundresses at every turn.\nMeanwhile, it's just a 15-minute bus ride to Anacapri, where respite from Capri Town's day-tripper crowds and inflated prices await.\n\"Anacapri isn't completely free of overtourism,\" admits Formisano, referencing the tourist crush at the Blue Grotto, Villa San Michele and the chairlift to Monte Solaro. \"But head west, through the Boffe [main] quarter towards the lighthouse and the Migliera [trail], and you'll find the island's heart.\"\nPlan your trip\nArrive:\u00a0Get to Anacapri via bus or taxi from Capri Town or Marina Grande. Download the ATC Go app to calculate bus routes and buy tickets.\nStay:\u00a0The Giardino dell\u2019Arte offers lovely rooms and a sprawling garden.\nEat:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Aumm Aumm Family-friendly restaurant serving excellent Neapolitan-style pizza.\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Il Riccio Sea Lounge Jumeirah Capri Palace's luxe beach restaurant at the Blue Grotto.\n\u2022\u00a0Ristorante La Zagara Restaurant inside a lemon grove. The neighbouring vinoteca offers gourmet aperitivi.\nAnacapri is crisscrossed by stone-walled paths that yield to sudden sea views; perfumed in springtime by blooming orange trees. The terrain is hilly; locals zip by me on scooters and dusty motorised three-wheeled buggies. One wrong turn and I find myself either wheezing up a steep incline or at the cliff's edge.\nDespite the divine aimlessness of wandering Anacapri on foot, its principal outdoor attractions are best reached with wheels. The ATC Capri Srl buses operate regularly between Piazza Vittoria, the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena, a craggy bay dominated by the island's rust-red 19th-Century lighthouse, where sunbathers splay themselves on the rocks or dive nose-first into the sea. Beach clubs are cut into the cliffs, the most beloved being da Antonio, a shack serving panini, gelato and an excellent crouton-and-aubergine panzanella salad. The upscale Lido del Faro features a pool and a full-service restaurant; I enjoy a bracing limoncello Spritz while watching the wild swimmers from above.\nBut Punta Carena is best known for its sunsets.\n\"It's the only place on Capri where the sun sets into the sea,\" says Formisano. \"Thanks to Capri's particular shape, Anacapri remains sun-kissed until sunset. Sunsets here are a special experience, casting a golden light that envelops the landscape.\"\nIt was Formisano who first directed me to the Trail of Little Forts. \"A must-see,\" she called it.\nTip:\nIf starting the Trail of Little Forts from the Blue Grotto, take the Anacapri-Grotta Azzurra bus from Piazza della Pace until the Orrico stop, then head to the Piazzetta di Orrico to start the trail. Allow approximately three hours to complete.\nThe medium-difficulty trail runs along Anacapri's western coast between the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena. It's possible to start the trail at either end, but most trekkers begin at the Blue Grotto.\n\"So you can walk calmly immersed in nature, have a swim in M\u00e8sola cove and get to the lighthouse by afternoon; just in time to enjoy an aperitif and the magnificent spectacle of the sunset over the sea,\" says Formisano.\nBack in the Boffe quarter, Piazza della Pace is the origin point for two other brilliant Anacapri hikes; the Migliera trail and Mount Solaro.\n\"The Migliera is a narrow road winding through the countryside,\" says Formisano. \"You'll come to a dramatic cliff overlook. Climb the ridge to the left; you'll get a really unique view of the faraglioni.\"\nHowever, the view from Mount Solaro \u2013 Capri's highest point \u2013 is arguably the island's most famous. The 13-minute chairlift up the 589m mountain provides unforgettable views of terraced vineyards with the Amalfi Coast winking in the distance.\nVertigo? Summit Mount Solaro on foot by following Via Axel Munthe to Via Salita per il Solaro, keeping an eye out for stray mountain goats.\nFor any Anacapri hike, wear trail shoes; not your new Capri leather sandals. Before setting off, \"stop at De Martino in Piazza Capri for an excellent panino\", advises Formisano.\nMost people reach Anacapri by bus, but if you're fit, consider tackling the 1.7km Scala Fenicia, a 921-step flight of stone stairs chiselled into the cliffs by the Ancient Greeks; allowing countless generations of hardy Capresi to travel between Capri and Anacapri.\n\"It's not for everyone,\" admits Pep Minichino, founder of the Gulf of Naples-based blog, Campanica. Nonetheless, he encourages visitors to \"embrace the experience! All you need is a Led Zeppelin anthem [in your head] for the energy to climb the famous zig-zag staircase.\"\nThe Scala Fenicia, which can be accessed from Marina Grande, leads straight up to Villa San Michele, the residence of the early 20th-Century Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. The sprawling mansion \u2013 built over Roman ruins, featuring grand sitting rooms and Neoclassical gardens \u2013 is Anacapri's most touristed museum. But I came to climb, and my heart rate thunders as I bypass the tourist hordes at Marina Grande to undertake the trek, surrounded by olive trees, terraced lemon groves and, finally at the top, the sea.\n\"La Scala Fenicia is also open at night, so you can go down step by step,\" says Minichino. \"Slowly. Aided in your descent by a cascade of lights and stars.\"\nBy far, Anacapri's most visited attraction is the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), famed for its magical blue phosphorescence. Chaotic overtourism has engulfed this natural phenomenon, and I am overwhelmed by the massive queue and dozens of tourist-packed boats bobbing outside the grotto. But, once inside, the azure-blue light is breathtaking, and I am comforted as the boat captain's serenade of O Sole Mio echoes through the cave.\nFormisano's hack: \"The best way to visit the Blue Grotto is to be on the entrance steps at 09:00, arriving by land from Anacapri, not by sea from Marina Grande,\" she says. \"This way you'll be first in line. You won't have to wait your turn on a rocking boat.\"\nBut to truly enjoy the seas of Anacapri, Formisano suggests doing as the Capresi do: \"Going down to the Blue Grotto, follow the signs for \"gradola\" to reach a small terrace overlooking the sea with an excellent restaurant, a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.\"\nMinichino agrees: \"The best swimming, diving and sunbathing in Anacapri.\"\n\"After a day of outdoor activities in Anacapri, the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in the town's authentic, peaceful atmosphere,\" says Formisano.\nMy B&B, Giardino dell'Arte, is no sumptuous 19th-Century Capri Town palazzo, but my tidy room is floored with blue and white ceramic tiles, and orange blossoms spill over the wooden door. The courtyard overlooks a garden and the innkeeper offers me homemade ravioli alla Caprese; round ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs.\nStrolling deeper into the Boffe quarter, I come upon La Casa Rossa, a bright red mansion built by the American colonel John Clay MacKowen in the early 20th Century; a quirky blend of architectural styles ranging from medieval to Middle Eastern. There are generational bakeries in leaf-shaded alleys where I buy fistfuls of sour cherry pastries and pizzette.\nBut the neighbourhood stunner is the Chiesa Monumentale di San Michele Arcangelo, a petite Baroque church with a show-stopping majolica floor in ochres and blues depicting the Fall of Eden. The tiles can only be viewed from strategically positioned wooden boards or from the balcony above. Wide-mouthed crocodiles, lions and hooved Biblical beasts leer up at me, Adam and Eve at the centre of the fray.\nIt's my favourite view island\u2026 until the rooftops.\nBecause Anacapri is still Capri, just off the Boffe quarter there are two opulent hotels; Jumeirah Capri Palace and the historic Hotel Caesar Augustus, a palatial structure dating to 1850 whose clifftop terrace seems to extend into the sea. I charm my way into both, and wind up on their rooftop bars as the sun sinks pink and purple into the Gulf of Naples, throwing Ischia and Procida into bas relief. Another limoncello Spritz, and I sink into a luxurious armchair, crossing my dusty ankles in their hiking boots; princess and athlete all at once.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.\nIt was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".\nFor someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something. \nI recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline. \nWhile this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell. \nCarney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\". \nHis supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey. \n\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"\nAt his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.\n\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.\nIn normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.\nWhen I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.\n\nMr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.\nIt was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him. \nThis bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.\nThe election result was staggering. \nEntering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls. \nPierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide. \nBut then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened. \nThen after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.\nThe election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump. \nPoilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government. \nCarney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump. \nAnd incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.\n\nCarney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier. \nHe also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere. \nCanada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.\nIn any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards. \nHe seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.\nOn Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.\nAll roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.\nAssuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world. \nIt is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.\nAll of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process. \nJapan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations. \nThe EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.\nIt comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.\nThere is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions. \nThe flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.\nAs a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.\nBut Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue. \nHe will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US. \nThe Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.\nThis is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.",

        "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.\nThe top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.\nSo much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.\nBut 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.\nBut is that accurate, or too simplistic?\nTo get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.\nBy 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.\n\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.\n\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"\nSplits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.\nDepending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.\nWestern Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.\nBut people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.\nAs a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".\n\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.\nCzechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"\nRussia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.\nFor VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.\nThe official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.\nThat invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.\n\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"\nThis is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.\nEurope has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.\nBut this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.\nFollowing WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.\nThe idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.\nMight we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.\n\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.\nThe war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.\nEurope, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.\nThe televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.\nA YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.\nIn Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.\nIf Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.\nAnd with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.\nThe message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.\nThat's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.\nThe Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.\nUrsula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"\nStill, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.\nChina, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.\nTrump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.\nWittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".\nDespite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.\nSome also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".\nPerhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.\nAnalysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. \nThis is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.\nMr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.\n\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.\n\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"\nEight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

        "article_text": "Grip strength is associated with a range of health outcomes, from type 2 diabetes to depression. Here\u2019s how to check yours.\nIn a world of technologically-driven longevity clinics with their increasingly sophisticated imaging scans, some of which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, it turns out that one of the best assessments of muscle strength and quality is to simply sit in a chair and squeeze a tennis ball.\u00a0\nThat's the recommendation offered by Joshua Davidson, a strength and conditioning researcher at the University of Derby who studies hand grip strength, a metric increasingly recognised as one of the most reliable markers of human health.\nWhen testing grip strength in clinical trials, scientists typically use a hand dynamometer, a device which you squeeze as hard as possible to measure the force generated by the muscles in your hand and forearm. Several companies are now attempting to take the dynamometer out of the clinic and into the home, combining easy-to-use devices with mobile apps to let anyone chart their grip strength over time.\nHowever, according to Davidson, you can still get a decent idea through a simple \"squeeze test\" with a tennis or stress ball. \"All you need is any object that you can grasp and can be deformed without causing pain or discomfort,\" he says. \"Simply squeeze it for as long as you can before your grip fatigues. Being able to maintain a maximal squeeze on something like a tennis ball for 15-30 seconds would be a good standard to strive for.\" Noting down how long you can squeeze can help you track your grip strength over time.\u00a0\nOf course, as Mark Peterson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation professor at the University of Michigan points out, having a weak grip strength alone will have relatively little impact on your everyday life directly, beyond making it a little bit harder to open cans or jars. But researchers are increasingly using grip strength as a proxy for overall musculoskeletal strength throughout the body. It can reflect whether a person is active enough or too sedentary and indicate their risk of frailty \u2013 the condition of being vulnerable as a result of a decline in one's physiological health.\nThis first came to scientists' attention through a particularly notable study of nearly 140,000 adults across high, middle and low-income countries which found grip strength was a better predictor for premature death than other more obvious indicators such as blood pressure.\nOther research has revealed that a person's grip strength can indicate their likelihood of living past 100. In one study, volunteers had their grip strengths measured in 1965-1968, when they were between 56 and 68 years old, and their survival was tracked for the next 44 years. Those who became centenarians were 2.5 times more likely to have had grip strength results in the highest third, compared to those who died before the age of 79.\u00a0\u00a0\nDarryl Leong, an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Canada, explains that your handgrip strength \u2013 and therefore your overall muscular strength \u2013 is a sum of your nutrition, physical activity and whether you have any illnesses. \"This is the reason it's associated with so many health outcomes,\" he says.\nOne study which used dynamometer testing found that grip strength scores of less than 25.5 kilograms for men and 18 kilograms for women suggests a heightened risk of sarcopenia throughout the body, the progressive loss of muscle mass and function which is linked to decreased strength and mobility in later life, and a greater likelihood of falling and developing fractures.\nGuillaume Par\u00e9, a practising physician and a professor of medicine at McMaster University, says that it's possible to tell a lot even from a simple handshake, with grip strength serving as a marker for whether someone is likely to have sarcopenia. \"Weaker handshakes where fingers struggle to close completely around my hand, or where hand muscles are emaciated, are red flags,\" he says.\nBut the links between grip strength and longevity go well beyond physical capabilities. Studies have shown that muscle is a key player in the metabolic system, acting as a reservoir which can soak up excess blood glucose and help prevent the development of insulin resistance. Because of this, a weaker grip can indicate that a person is more prone to a plethora of problems linked to metabolic dysfunction, ranging from type 2 diabetes to lower bone mineral density, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and depression.\nIf you do have a dynamometer to hand, you can use the chart above to compare your grip strength against. The results were taken from a study on the average grip strength measurements for healthy people in each sex across different age groups.\nBack in 2022, Peterson led a study which assessed the grip strength of 1,275 men and women and compared these results to an analysis of their DNA. The team found that those with lower grip strength scores showed signs of accelerated ageing. Specifically, they had differences in their DNA methylation patterns \u2013 tags associated with our DNA which can alter the way it is read over our lifetimes. Methylation patterns often change in response to environmental or lifestyle factors, such as obesity, pollution or even social stress, among many other things.\nWrist curls: Improve your grip strength\nBegin by sitting with your arms on your lap. Grip a can in your hand, with your palm facing upwards. Then slowly bring the can upwards towards your body, without moving your arm. Hold it there for a second, and carefully lower it back down. With practise, aim to build up to doing five sets of 20 repetitions.\nFor Par\u00e9 this is unsurprising, as he says he sees grip strength as a key marker of both disease resilience and likelihood of recovering from chronic illnesses. For example, research in cancer patients shows that those with poorer grip strength are more likely to experience sudden weight loss or cachexia \u2013 extreme muscle or fat loss, despite eating normally \u2013 and thus worse prognosis and survival outcomes.\n\"It means that once we have a disease, our ability to fight it is limited,\" says Peterson. \"For example, the risk of dying from a pneumonia is much increased in individuals with lower grip strength, which makes sense considering the importance of good muscular health to properly clear the airways of sputum [the saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract as a result of infections].\"\nGrip strength isn't just something to be aware of in later life, either. Researchers have even found that the average grip strength of a population tends to correlate with how many medals a country is likely to win at the Olympic Games. Meanwhile, Par\u00e9 says that teenagers and young adults who have poorer grip strength are likely to be more prone to health issues at an earlier age. One study in Brazil showed that teenagers who spent more time on their screens, either on their phones or other devices, tended to have worse grip strength.\n\"There's data supporting the association of low grip strength with poor metabolic health even in young adults,\" says Par\u00e9.\nSo, can we improve our grip strength? Certainly, says Davidson, and it's something which you can work on irrespective of your age. He suggests simply using the tennis ball test to progressively work the muscles of your hand and forehand to contract at maximal power for as long as you can. With practise, you should see steady improvements over time, he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Sit-to-stand: The simple test that reveals how you're ageing\n\u2022 The ruler drop test: Check your reaction times\n\u2022 What your fingernails can reveal about your health\u00a0\nIt also isn't just about grip. Leong recommends working on being more physically active in general and training the muscles in your lower and upper body. If you do this, he says your grip strength will improve accordingly.\u00a0\nFor older adults, Leong suggests trying the timed get-up-and-go test. \"Here, the individual records with a stopwatch, the time taken to rise from a chair, walk three metres, turn around and return to the seated position,\" says Leong. \"This is a test of lower limb strength and mobility and will help improve your total muscle strength.\"\nDavidson says that general resistance exercises to improve muscle mass and maintain bone mineral density will lead to improvements in grip strength. \"We all need to engage in regular physical activity as we age,\" he says. \"You can work out at home either using specialist equipment or just things you have around the house. Two to three sets of single arm wrist curls, with reps of between 10 and 20, is a good exercise to start with. If you have a kettlebell at home, bicep curls are also good exercises to try.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From blossoming long-distance love to helping families stay connected, for years Skype held a unique place in people's hearts.\nIn the days before Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams, the video call service was once one of the world's most popular websites.\nIt allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world.\nIn recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Its services will close for good on 5 May, with the Skype for Business feature the only part to remain.\nHere are just some of the many people whose lives were touched by Skype since it launched in 2003.\nWeng and Owen Williams have a lot to thank Skype for - it is one of the main reasons they are married.\nIn 2012, Weng left Macau, China to start a six-month internship at a National Trust site in Carmarthenshire, Wales.\nFeeling a bit homesick, she would speak to friends and family on Skype. She then met Owen, who was also working for the National Trust.\nAt first they were friends, but after Weng returned to Macau, romance blossomed over months of Skype chats and visits to see one another.\n\"Skype was a very important part of our relationship,\" she said. \nWhen they decided to embark on a long-distance relationship, Skype was the glue that held it together.\nThey video called every day - including when Weng sent Owen a birthday cake and he cut it in front of her during their chat.\n\"That was quite sweet,\" she said. \"Skype just kept us going.\"\nThe pair ultimately got engaged, and Weng moved back to Wales in 2015.\nNow, they are happily married.\nLike many over the years, Erica from New Zealand used Skype to communicate with a loved one while they were in another part of the world. \nIn her case, it was her husband when one of them was on a work trip.\nFollowing his death in 2017, Skype took on another role for Erica, who spoke to the BBC anonymously.\n\"I was clearing out his files to decommission his work computer,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I had the opportunity to review these messages we had exchanged and realised how they inadvertently documented a period of distress and heartache in our relationship.\"\nWhat Erica did next tried to bring some closure to this difficult period in her life.\n\"I sent a posthumous message to his Skype address to which, I - or he - replied from his computer,\" she said.\nErica said she then began a brief conversation back and forth \"over a period of weeks\" - where she would send a message to his Skype address, then reply to herself from his account.\n\"In this exchange, we responded to each other's messages and questions with all the apologies and regret that we needed to hear from each other,\" she said. \n\"It helped me to move on. I believed it.\"\nSince 2003, Susan Bertotti has lived in Chile. Skype has been her way of keeping in touch with her mum Vera, who lives in in Milton Keynes.\nFor the past 15 years, they have spoken to each other every day they are apart on Skype.\nFrom sharing Christmas memories to showing each other their gardens in Chile and England, the video call app has been a constant.\n\"Skype has given my mother and I the most wonderful close connection all these years,\" Susan said.\nWhen she became her mum's carer, Susan used the app to deal with all her life admin back in the UK. \nAs the years went on, the family starting using WhatsApp, but they still use Skype to set up their chats. Vera is now 99.\n\"It is going to be a huge loss to me,\" Susan said.\n\"I'll be back to making lost-distance calls now on her behalf, and that will be horrible, or I'll have to email.\n\"I'm so disappointed about losing Skype.\"\nBeing able to call internationally without big fees are an important part of Stan Calderwood's business. \nOn the day it was announced the service would close, he had used it eight times to call estate agents, accountants and lawyers in Canada about the sale of a property there.\n\"You can't call everyone on WhatsApp, Zoom or Teams,\" he said.\n\"You do have to call people on their mobiles and their landlines, particularly businesses.\"\nStan is now looking for a new low-cost alternative for cheap international calls.\nWhile Skype fell away in recent years, it still had millions of users - with the website Statista stating it had almost 28 million as of March last year. \nSo what will happen now? \nMicrosoft says Skype's free services will be retired, and users have a choice - move over to Teams, or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history.\n\"The timing of this shift is driven by the significant advancements and adoption of Microsoft Teams,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\"Teams free offers many of the same core features as Skype.\"\nMeanwhile, the firm says its Skype for Business users are unaffected by the change and the service will continue. \nOne of those customers is the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Long-distance romance and closure from husband's death - your memories of Skype24 hours agoShareSaveGraham FraserTechnology reporterShareSaveOwen and Weng WilliamsSkype would help change the lives of Owen and Weng WilliamsFrom blossoming long-distance love to helping families stay connected, for years Skype held a unique place in people's hearts.In the days before Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams, the video call service was once one of the world's most popular websites.It allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world.In recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Microsoft says Skype's free services will be retired, and users have a choice - move over to Teams, or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history. \"Skype was a very important part of our relationship,\" she said.

        "article_text": "A wild beaver has been filmed on a river in Wales in what has been described as a \"hugely significant\" sighting.\nBeavers disappeared from Britain about 400 years ago after being hunted to extinction, but in the past two decades they have been making a comeback.\nNaturalist and presenter Iolo Williams, who encountered the wild beaver on the River Dyfi near Machynlleth, said the clear and prolonged sighting was one of the \"very, very best\" things he had ever witnessed.\nThere are four managed enclosures that house beavers in Wales, and an unknown number living in the wild.\n\"I've seen some incredible wildlife in Wales, some amazing things, but this ranks up there, not just with the best, but as the very, very best,\" said Williams, who captured the moment as part of his BBC series Iolo's River Valleys.\n\"The last people to see wild beaver in Wales would have been the Welsh princes, who would have hunted them. \n\"So they've been absent for hundreds of years. So it's hugely significant.\"\nIn Wales, it is an offence to release beavers into open rivers without a licence, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said no licences of this type had been issued.\nIn England, where the government recently approved beavers' reintroduction to the wild, it is thought that there are about 500 of them - some in the wild and others in enclosures.\nIn Scotland, which began reintroducing beavers to the wild several years ago, it is thought that there are now more than 1,500.\n\"We had information that a beaver had been seen on this section of the River Dyfi, and we were told to get to this particular site at 18:00 and the beaver will be there,\" said Williams.\n\"We had gone out a few days before, and it poured with rain and we'd seen nothing.\n\"And I must admit, I was thinking, we're not going to get it. \n\"But then when we went on the first dry day, 18:00, and the beaver was there.\"\nWilliams said the beaver \"didn't pay us any attention at all\".\n\"It was very chill,\" he added.\n\"We were on the opposite bank, and we thought we better be quiet, don't move around. And the beaver just saw us and it just carried on feeding and swam.\"\nLocal people have reported seeing the beaver, and others, on the same stretch of the River Dyfi multiple times in recent years.\nBut exactly where they have come from remains a mystery, after a nearby beaver enclosure ruled out any escapes.\nAlicia Leow-Dyke, from Wildlife Trust Wales, said there was evidence of the semi-aquatic animals breeding along the waterway.\n\"On this occasion we know it's one family. It could be two families - one family split into two,\" she said.\n\"There has been evidence of breeding on the river. Youngsters have been spotted on the river over the years.\n\"Beavers only breed once a year and their litters are pretty small - two to three within a litter. So a beaver family could be anything from two adults, to five or eight if you include the young.\"\nLast year the Welsh government said it was considering introducing legislation to protect beavers, as wildlife charities called for them to be released into Wales' rivers.\nDr Robert Needham, from the Beaver Trust, said their reintroduction could bring substantial benefits, describing them as \"ecosystem engineer[s]\".\n\"What this means is that the sort of habitat modification that beavers can do through damming, building lodges, digging canals - this can create habitats for other species, and they can increase biodiversity,\" said Dr Needham.\n\"They can help restore our wetland habitats, which are massively lost throughout Europe, let alone Great Britain.\n\"They can help alleviate flooding with the dams that they create, particularly in headwater streams, they hold that water back, releasing it slowly. So we see a reduction in peak flow events, during storm events. But this can also be really beneficial to villages and society during summer periods, during drought conditions.\"\nBut not everyone believes that reintroducing beavers to the wild is a good thing. \nCritics say their dams can flood and waterlog fields while the animals themselves can feed on certain agricultural crops and damage trees.\n\"Fundamentally, there are issues. There are cases where river banks will fall in and the impact of flooding, particularly on good farmland as well,\" said Aled Jones, president of NFU Cymru.\n\"The management [of beavers] is crucial. We can't allow an indiscriminate approach where farming businesses are severely impacted. \n\"So we have to have control measures because this is their livelihoods. And we have to remember this is where farmers make their living, and anything negatively impacting that, if they're losing their crops because of flooding, who pays?\"\nIolo's River Valleys will be broadcast on BBC Two and BBC One Wales on 6 May at 19:00 and will also be available on BBC iPlayer.\nSign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

No excuses, man. Congrats to him - he did a great job,\" Garcia said.\nGarcia was competing for the first time since serving a one-year doping ban after testing positive for banned substance ostarine following his victory over Haney in April 2024, which was overturned into a no-contest.\n\"A whole year took a lot of my body physically and mentally,\" Garcia said, adding that he would now go \"back to the drawing board\".\nEarlier, Haney, 26, kept his side of the bargain with a unanimous yet underwhelming  win against fellow American Jose Carlos Ramirez.\nHaney boxed on the back foot as neither fighter threw anything of note in a forgettable 12-round contest.\nIn the performance of the night, American two-weight world champion Teofimo Lopez defended his WBO light-welterweight title with a stylish points win over compatriot Arnold Barboza Jr.\nFormer undisputed lightweight champion Devin Haney (left) extended his record to 32 professional wins\nOrganisers in Saudi Arabia were lining up the rematch for later this year, as long as Haney and Garcia won.\nAfter a year lay-off, an overly cautious Haney, who was dropped three times by Garcia last year, never really got going in a below-par showing.\nHe circled around the ring, landing the occasional lead left hook, but neglected his jab as single shots did enough to edge the rounds.\nDefensively, it was a sound performance by Haney, largely because gun-shy Ramirez did so little.\nThe judges scored it 119-109, 119-109 and 118-110.\nThe bout was best summed up by Scotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor, who said on social media that Haney looked \"terrified\" and \"frantic\".\nHaney-Ramirez sapped the 'Big Apple' of its energy and vibe but the early drama in the headline bout lifted the mood.\nRomero landed a stinging double left hook to floor Garcia. It was a flush and hurtful punch which he later followed with a clubbing right before Garcia regained his senses.\nWith both fighters unwilling to over-commit, Romero edged the rounds with better use of the jab, coupled with Garcia's tentativeness.\n\"Get busy,\" trainer Derrick James pleaded with Garcia before the championship rounds.\nThe pep talk had no impact as Romero landed a combination to head and body in the 11th. Haney, now ringside, was left shaking his head at the final bell.\nTimes Square - located where Broadway and 7th Avenue meet at 42nd Street  - was turned into a boxing venue.\nIn a first for the sport, a ring was constructed in the middle of the city's iconic landmark.\nFighters were driven through the New York traffic in distinctive vehicles, including classic yellow cabs and monster trucks.

        "article_text": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.\nThis is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.\nAt the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to estimate that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.\nThe BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.\nSo far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.\n20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.\nAmong the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.\nThey had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.\nBairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.\nIn February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.\nOkhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.\nUnlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.\nIn total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.\nA few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.\nThere was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.\nA relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"\nIn our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.\nIn the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.\nIn 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.\nIn the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.\nIn 2023, the number rose to 37,633.\nIn 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.\nIn August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.\nHowever, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.\n\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.\nAfter almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.\nAccording to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.\nEven then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.\nThe cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.\nActual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.\nOverall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land. \nIf we assume that our figure of 45,287 confirmed deaths in 2024 is about 40% of the full number, then the total number would be closer to 112,000 fatalities last year.\nThis means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.\nRussia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.\n\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.\nOne-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.\nWe also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.\nVolunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.\nIn 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.\nOne Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.\nThe one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).\nCalculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.\nThis is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.\nThe true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.\nAn assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.\nThat would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.\nCLARIFICATION 5 May 2025: This story has been updated to make it clear that the figure of 27 losses per sq km is based on an estimated number of deaths last year of about 112,000.",

Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.\nChina's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.\n\"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.\nBut anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.\nWhile pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.\nTheir sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.\nIn 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.\nIndia, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (\u00a375bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.\nIn response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.\nIndia also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.\nDespite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. \nThat's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. \nWhile western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.\nIndia's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.\n\"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. \n\"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\"\nIndia needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.\nAkash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. \nWith fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.\nChina wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\".\nDespite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.\n\"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black \"dandy\" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement.\nBlack dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. A dandy is a flamboyantly dressed male figure who is concerned not only with looking good but with making a statement about his identity and individuality. And black dandyism is a defiant declaration against confinement, a celebration of black identity, and a movement based around resistance, pride and history.\nThe story of black dandyism does not begin with clothing but with the absence of it. Enslaved Africans, writes Monica L Miller in Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity (2009), \"arrived in America physically and metaphorically naked, a seeming tabula rasa on which European and new American fashions might be imposed\". Dandyism was a critical response to this, and was born out of a desire to self-define and envisage new social and political possibilities \u2013 in a context where the very concept of \"blackness\" was created by non-black oppressors.\nInspired by Miller's seminal book, the exhibition examines how men's style, and in particular, dandyism, has helped shape transatlantic black identities for more than 300 years. The star-studded Met Gala in New York, which takes place on Monday, takes the corresponding theme \"Tailored for you\" as its dress code. Co-chairing and hosting the event are actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician and creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and honorary co-chair, basketball player LeBron James.\nThe show features garments, artworks, photographs and film, and explores 12 different characteristics of dandyism, ranging from Ownership, Heritage and Presence to Respectability, Beauty and Cool. The \"superfine\" in the title, says Miller, who is guest curator of the exhibition, pertains to \"a finely woven wool, which we're using as an expression of luxury, but also feeling 'superfine'\" \u2013 a reminder that how you dress can contain \"a lot of emotion\".\nIndeed, one of slavery's first acts of debasement was to strip the enslaved of their own clothes, and dress them in standard-issue clothing. \"Everyone was supposed to look exactly the same,\" Miller tells the BBC. \"It was a vehicle of dehumanisation, but people immediately affixed buttons, ribbons, modified the garment a little, literally tailored it so that it could be individualised.\" Dandyism was already laying its foundations.\nIn the 17th and 18th Centuries, for enslaved Africans brought back to Europe as domestic servants, control was once again asserted by their masters \u2013 in some households they were dressed up in ostentatious, deliberately anachronistic livery, their masters objectifying them in order to signal the family's wealth. Some were educated alongside members of the host family, whose guests were amused to see someone of colour speak and act like a gentleman.\nHowever, in the case of Julius Soubise \u2013 manumitted (released from slavery) in the 1760s by his British mistress, the Duchess of Queensbury \u2013 the joke was on the aristocrats. Soubise reclaimed and exaggerated the flamboyant clothing that his mistress had made him wear by adding diamond-buckled red-heeled shoes, lace frills and clouds of perfume, and his subversive, startlingly feminised dandyism created shockwaves among white society. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be.\nWhile Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment. It was a form of dressing up that enabled William and Ellen Craft to escape slavery in Georgia in 1848, as told in William's 1860 memoir. Transgressing \u2013 once again \u2013 boundaries of race, gender and class, Ellen, the daughter of an enslaved woman and her slaveholder, disguised herself as a white invalid gentleman \u2013 complete with jaw bandage and sling, and green-lensed spectacles \u2013 in order to escape her captors, while her husband William was passed off as her servant. When William, with freedom in sight, dandified himself with \"a very good second-hand white beaver [top hat]\" the pair's cover was almost blown, drawing comments from a disgruntled planter that his \"master\" was spoiling him. Their escape succeeded, and the two went on to build a new life across the ocean in England.\nLater, with the abolition of slavery in 1865, the Crafts were emboldened to move back to the US, while other black Americans began relocating from the rural South to the expanding cities of the North, establishing, for the first time, large black urban communities. One of these was Harlem, New York City, which, during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, became a centre of creative expression and a manifestation of the black freedom that so many had dreamt of.\nIn forging a modern black identity and standing up against lynchings, riots and persistent discrimination, dressing up again played a central role. In 1917, around 10,000 African Americans took part in the Silent Protest Parade down New York's Fifth Avenue, the men in black tailored suits, the women and children dressed in white. It was a display of respectability, calm and control that contrasted with the savagery of the violence perpetrated against them.\nThe suit, explains Miller, is \"a historical throughline\" in the exhibition, which includes everything \"from livery garments\u2026 to tailcoats and different versions of it\u2026 to even track suiting\". One of the most dandified examples is the zoot suit, which debuted in Harlem's dance halls in the 1930s before spreading across the country. Donned by performers such as Dizzy Gillespie and Cab Calloway, as well as the activist Malcolm X, it featured oversized shoulder pads, wide lapels and ballooning trousers cuffed at the ankle, and was often accessorised with a pocket watch on a long chain and a brimmed hat. Its sheer voluminosity seemed symbolic of a burgeoning black community's desire to take up their own space and to move with freedom.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Seven of the best Met Gala looks over the decades\n\u2022 Coachella looks from Lady Gaga to Sabrina Carpenter\n\u2022The indigenous American supermodel bringing change\nWhen rationing was introduced in the 1940s, this expression of counter culture became a source of supposed indignation due to the amount of fabric the zoot required. This became a pretext for further violence against people of colour, particularly in Los Angeles, where white mobs stripped people of their suits and slashed the fabric with knives. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched \"Hammer pants\".\nDescribed by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as \"a dandy among dandies\", Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. His favourite photo of himself, taken in the 1980s, appears in the exhibition, along with the panel-checked Morty Sills suit he is wearing. Later, he would become known for his luxurious swooshing capes. \"He understood that, especially as a black man, what you wore told a story about you, about your history, about self-respect,\" writes Wintour. \"For Andr\u00e9, getting dressed was an act of autobiography, and also mischief and fantasy, and so much else at once.\"\nFor Nigerian-American artist, photographer and writer Ik\u00e9 Ud\u00e9, whose self-portrait appears on the cover of Miller's 2009 book, the construction of self through fashion is a critical reaction to negative perceptions of it. \"Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification,\" he writes in his 1995 essay The Regarded Self. In Sartorial Anarchy #5 (2013), part of a series of self-portraits by Ud\u00e9, we see a pastiche of dandyism that both embraces this display and satirises it. \"He's wearing male dress in all of those portraits but from different time periods and geographies,\" explains Miller. \"It's a real manifestation of cosmopolitanism and wit.\"\nThis theme of cosmopolitanism continues in the clothing of award-winning designer Foday Dumbuya, whose brand Labrum reflects his own journey from Sierra Leone to Cyprus and England, and features the tagline \"designed by an immigrant\". Much of his work celebrates his African heritage, and uses sharp, sartorial design to challenge negative associations with Africa and with migration. \"He's designing garments that often use immigration documents from his own family or from other people that he incorporates into the printed silk fabric,\" says Miller. The idea for the exhibition began, she adds, with an observation by the curator of the Met's costume collection, Andrew Bolton, \"that there was a kind of renaissance going on in menswear and black designers were really at the forefront of that\".\nBlack dandyism, maintains Miller, is part of a culture in constant movement. \"Black people are always trying to outrun stereotype and appropriation, and if we take it all the way back to the 19th Century, they're trying to outrun capture, so there's a way that that's built into the culture.\" Consequently, dandyism shows no signs of dwindling. \"It's very much related to a jazz riff,\" Miller adds. \"Somebody puts that down, somebody picks that up, modifies it, changes it, it becomes something new\u2026\"\nSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City from 10 May to 26 October 2025.

'Clothes can contain a lot of emotion': How black men have used flamboyant fashion to express pride and resistance3 days agoShareSaveDeborah Nicholls-LeeShareSaveTyler Mitchell(Credit: Tyler Mitchell)This year's Costume Institute spring exhibition and Met Gala are honouring black \"dandy\" style, and the tradition of bold tailoring worn by black men that has made a statement.Black dandyism, the subject of the Costume Institute's much-anticipated spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, is a rich theme. But the zoot suit was too strong a signifier of black sartorial elegance to be entirely subdued, and has continued to reassert its importance, reappearing as the trademark style of the musical group Kid Creole and the Coconuts in the 1980s, for example, and later inspiring rapper MC Hammer's iconic baggy-crotched \"Hammer pants\".Whereas the self can be devoured by public scrutiny, it can be saved by private self-objectification \u2013 Ik\u00e9 Ud\u00e9Described by Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of US Vogue) in a recent article as \"a dandy among dandies\", Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley (1948-2022), the first black creative director at US Vogue, was born at the tail end of the zoot suit's reign, and went on to become one of fashion's black luminaries. Educated, witty and charming, and a capable equestrian, fencer and violinist, he destabilised established categorisations of race, gender and class, and forced a reimagining in the white consciousness of what a black man could be.Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe zoot suit debuted in the dance halls of Harlem in the 1930s, and soon gained popularity across the US (Credit: Metropolitan Museum of Art)While Soubise used dandyism to assert visibility, elsewhere in the exhibition, dandyism is shown being used for concealment.

Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote \"Starbase, Texas is now a real city!\" on his social media platform X.\nThe new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.\nThe city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.\nSince SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.\nAbout 500 people are estimated to live nearby.\nThe possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.\nThe first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. \nThe BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.\nStarbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.\nA bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.\nCurrently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.\n\nThe result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.\nThe top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.\nIn recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.\nThe headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.\nIn contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers \u2013 most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.\nEnvironmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. \nIn 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.\nThe company has called the fines the result of \"disagreements over paperwork\" and maintains it follows environmental laws.

        "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.\nThe top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.\nSo much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.\nBut 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.\nBut is that accurate, or too simplistic?\nTo get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.\nBy 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.\n\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.\n\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"\nSplits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.\nDepending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.\nWestern Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.\nBut people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.\nAs a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".\n\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.\nCzechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"\nRussia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.\nFor VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.\nThe official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.\nThat invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.\n\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"\nThis is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.\nEurope has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.\nBut this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.\nFollowing WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.\nThe idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.\nMight we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.\n\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.\nThe war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.\nEurope, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.\nThe televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.\nA YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.\nIn Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.\nIf Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.\nAnd with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.\nThe message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.\nThat's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.\nThe Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.\nUrsula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"\nStill, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.\nChina, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.\nTrump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.\nWittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".\nDespite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.\nSome also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".\nPerhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.\nAnalysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. \nThis is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.\nMr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.\n\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.\n\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"\nEight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

        "article_text": "\"It's not our night,\" Australia's opposition leader Peter Dutton told a roomful of supporters in Brisbane after his rival, Anthony Albanese, was re-elected as prime minister. \nIt was indeed a bruising night for Dutton, a 54-year-old political veteran who also lost his parliamentary seat of 24 years to a candidate from Albanese's Labor Party. \nThis is a big win for the prime minister, who made a surprising comeback to secure a comfortable majority for a second term. But it's an even bigger loss for Dutton and his Liberal National Coalition. \nDutton initially seemed to have an advantage over the incumbent PM who was battling a cost-of-living crisis and dismal ratings. But that advantage vanished as the campaign wore on, ending in a humiliating defeat.\nAn awkward and inconsistent campaign that did not do enough to reassure voters was partly to blame. But there is no mistaking the big part played by what some have called the \"Trump effect\". \nDutton, whether he liked it or not, was a man who many saw as Australia's Trump - but as it turns out Australians do not appear to want that. \nDutton's brand of hard-line conservatism, his support for controversial immigration policies \u2013 like sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centres \u2013 and his fierce criticism of China, all led to comparisons with US President Donald Trump.\nIt's a likeness he has rejected but then the Coalition pursued policies that seemed to have been borrowed from the Trump administration.\nDutton said that if elected he would cut public sector jobs - more than 40,000 by some estimates. This reminded voters of billionaire Elon Musk's Doge, or Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed US bureaucracy. Dutton later walked back the plan. \nThe Coalition even appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency. And images of her wearing a cap with the words Maga - short for the popular Trump slogan, Make America Great Again - have become a key talking point.  \nNone of this served Dutton well and he knew it. Towards the end of the campaign, he tried to shake off Trump's shadow, and in the final leaders' debate he repeatedly told the audience that he didn't know Trump before attempting to answer questions on him.\n\"The Coalition will probably regret issuing messages that came across as supporting Trump and opposing the US Democrats,\" said Frank Mols, a political science lecturer at the University of Queensland. \n\"Once the stock markets started to drop in response to the uncertainty created by the [Trump's] tariffs, it became harder for the Coalition to profile itself as a safer pair of hands for the economy.\"\nThe talk of trade wars and tariffs increased voters' worries. Speaking to people across Australia \u2013 the BBC travelled to Perth in Western Australia and Melbourne in the final week of campaigning \u2013 it was clear that global politics only became more important through the campaign.\nAustralia has long balanced its military alliance with the US and its economic relationship with China, its biggest trading partner. \nBut a US-China trade war, along with an unpredictable White House, is tricky territory for any country - even a US ally like Australia. \nCould Dutton provide stability in these unusual times?  \nDutton had long tried to convince voters that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with Trump. He often cited his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term.\nBut in the end voters weren't convinced. \nDutton's own inconsistent policies and the Trump-esque rhetoric and decisions appear to have driven away an electorate that is deeply concerned about a new, tumultuous world order.\n\"Our message was confusing... Labor had a tight and very disciplined campaign,\" Jitendra Prasad, a LNP supporter, told the BBC as he was about to leave the watch party on Saturday night after a disappointing outcome. \nThat was evident in the swings towards Labor across the country, which led to a fairly quick, emphatic result. \nTowards the end of the campaign, Dutton also embraced the right-wing One Nation Party, which some Coalition members had warned was the wrong move. And it didn't seem to have helped.

Analysts say this inconsistency confused voters and became an unfortunate theme in his campaign.\nHe announced and then walked back plans for huge changes to the bureaucracy, including job cuts and the plans to end work from home arrangements. He said it was \"a mistake\".\nBut \"the backflips on working from home and his uncertainty over public service cuts,\" complicated his message, according to John Warhurst, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University.\nThe result, many believe, was the lack of a coherent campaign. \n\"I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,\" a member of Dutton's own party in his Dickson constituency told the BBC earlier on Saturday. \nHe wondered if Dutton's support for nuclear energy put people off - an issue that analysts such as Dr Mols said could have worked against him because Australian voters had not \"warmed up\" to the idea of nuclear energy.  \nUltimately, the biggest issue this election - cost-of-living - may have helped Labor cement its message that theirs was the steadier hand. \nEvanthia Smith, another voter in Dutton's Dickson seat, said she voted for Labor because she believed their candidate would do more to improve public education and access to healthcare.\nDutton acknowledged the huge loss the Coalition had faced: \"Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight, including in my electorate of Dickson... We'll rebuild from here.\" \nIt was the same advice a supporter in Brisbane had for the party: \"The party needs to go back to the drawing block and look at their policies. We need to focus on the typical issues: Housing, cost-of-living - they are the biggest.\"",

The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate.\nAntonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie.\nIt was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year.\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAntonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend.\nBut at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying.\n\"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it.\n\"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\"\nAntonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly.\n\"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added.\n\"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\"\nStarting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1.\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nAntonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth.\nPiastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole.\nNorris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there.\n\"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\"\nAntonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap.\nThe idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second.\nBut it worked for neither. Russell did not improve on his second lap, and while Verstappen did, he was 0.255secs slower than Antonelli and 0.21secs off Piastri.\nVerstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: \"What we did in Q3 was good, the tyres are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time.\"\nHis lack of pace came despite a new floor this weekend as the team seek improved performance.\nVerstappen added: \"In the first sector we were quite competitive because that's where a few high-speed corners are but as soon as you get to the low speed we lack quite a bit of grip. P4 is all right, you have to be realistic with the limitations we have at the moment and it was still quite close.\"\nRussell said: \"Massive congrats to Kimi. He did an amazing job. He has been really quick all day, really impressive.\n\"I have been struggling a little bit, not that comfortable, and we wanted to go early because I didn't have that confidence. P5 is not great but amazing (result) for Kimi and the team.\"\nHamilton, who won the first sprint of the season in China from pole position, was seventh fastest, one place behind team-mate Charles Leclerc. It was an improvement for Hamilton after a dire past three races, but he was still 0.222secs off his team-mate.\nNeither Ferrari driver was happy. \"It was a better session,\" Hamilton said, \"but we are just lacking speed. Keep working on it.\"\nWilliams' Alex Albon, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso completed the top 10, only the second time the two-time champion's team has made it that high up this season, after team-mate Lance Stroll achieved it in the sprint in China.\nAlbon's team-mate Carlos Sainz should also have been in the top 10 but he made a mistake on his final lap in the second session and will line up 15th.\nVerstappen's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session and will start the sprint 18th.\nThe Japanese complained of being held up by a car coming out of the pits on his first lap, and he did not get around his warm-up lap in time to complete a second run.\nFernando Alonso was among those to congratulate Max Verstappen on the birth of his daughter Lily\nThe youngest driver to take pole position for a full grand prix is Sebastian Vettel, at the 2008 Italian GP at Monza when he was 21 years and two months old\nMcLaren's Piastri fastest in Miami practice\n'It's so bad' - who has got their Miami GP livery right?\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nMiami Grand Prix preview",

I had a clear vision for my life.\"\nBujumbura, located on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, is the commercial capital of a nation which is one of the world's poorest in terms of GDP per capita, according to the World Bank.\nBorn in the Buyenzi area of the city, Ndayishimiye is the eldest of three siblings and has another five half-siblings. His family later moved to the \"dumpsite neighbourhood\" of Buterere.\nHis skills on a football pitch helped him stand out even if, on occasion, he had to train barefoot.\nWhen bigger clubs came calling, he would even have to deal with bouts of jealousy from his peers.\n\"One day I had to borrow boots from a friend when a second division club, Les Lierres, had agreed to sign me,\" he said.\n\"I was devastated when he refused to lend me the boots [for a trial], but I didn't give up.\"\nAfter a spell playing for Aigle Noir in Burundi's southern province of Makamba, Ndayishimiye got his big break in Europe in January 2020 when he joined Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor.\nJust a year later he was on the move again, sealing a switch to Istanbul Basaksehir.\nThe defender is now well settled on the Cote d'Azur as vice-captain of Nice.\nHe has two children under five, is a committed Muslim, and retains links to his homeland with his support of Burundian musicians, whom he regularly listens to at home and in his car.\nThe centre-back says his story should serve as an inspiration to others.\n\"I knew that there was no other way to help me get out of this life than through football,\" he said.\n\"You should not lose hope. Look at the homes you grew up in, look at your destitute families, then wake up early and work hard to get your families out of poverty.\n\"So, it is vital for the youth to keep hope, respect God and work hard. None of us were born with the success we've reached.\"\nNdayishimiye's message about resilience will be important over the next few months, as he could be out of action until 2026 after rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in training last week.\nNdayishimiye spent two years playing in Turkey before joining Nice\nNdayishimiye's performances in his first full Ligue 1 campaign with Nice were strong enough to see him nominated for the Prix Marc-Vivien Foe Award, an award handed to the best African footballer in France.\nBefore suffering his injury, Ndayishimiye was leading from the front in the club's bid to reach the Champions League and, while wearing the captain's armband, he netted the killer third goal against Paris St-Germain last month.\nThat header kept his side in the hunt for a place at Europe's top table and ended PSG's hopes of becoming the first team to complete an unbeaten season in the French top flight.\nWhile usually taking acclaim from the stands at the Allianz Riviera, Ndayishimiye is well aware that playing in Europe comes with its downsides.\n\"Some of my team-mates here have been racially abused,\" he said.\n\"I always tell them 'let's focus on the job that brought us here. Let's shut those jealous people up with our performances'.\n\"Frankly, racism is like a pandemic - undefeatable anytime soon.\"\nNdayishimiye is proud of being black, but feels there is little he can do to combat discrimination in the game.\n\"Even before us, Yaya Toure tried his best, Samuel Eto'o tried but they couldn't succeed,\" he said.\n\"I can't do anything about it. I have no power.\n\"If I'm abused, it won't affect me because I know why I came \u2013 just to play football.\"\nBurundi's sole appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations came at the 2019 edition, when the side lost all three group games\nEven if Ndayishimiye makes his bow in the Champions League next season, he is still waiting to play at a major international tournament.\nHe was \"heartbroken\" to miss out on a place in Burundi's squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation (Afcon) as a 20-year-old, and the Swallows have not managed to qualify for the finals since.\nHowever, he is bullish about the country's chances of returning to Afcon in the near future \u2013 and going far at the tournament.\n\"There might be some challenges we don't always talk about, internal hurdles that we have to overcome, but ahead are three Afcons I want to lead my team to,\" he said.\n\"I'm now confident that I'll lead the Swallows to the upcoming 2027, 2029 and 2031 tournaments - and I believe that we will lift one of them.\"\nMeanwhile, Ndayishimiye is remembering his roots as he looks to the future.\nHe has ambitions to set up a football academy back in Burundi to support children from underprivileged families.\n\"A football career has a limited time span and I know that I have to make some savings, keeping in mind my poor background, so that I do not return to that life.\n\"That's advice I give my team-mates - manage your good salaries wisely so that we don't end up in regret.\n\"That's why, once I retire, I plan to open a school named after me.\"",

They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "A second-hand Zelda cartridge. A cryptic forum thread. A generation of frightened children. This is the story of Ben Drowned \u2013 the internet's most infamous video game ghost.\nIt was Christmas Eve and 10-year-old Saarthak Johri couldn't sleep \u2013 but not because of excitement. He was shot through with fear. It was roughly a decade ago and Johri was a kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, in the US. He had spent the day slumped in an easy chair, staring at his phone, totally absorbed in an online urban myth. Johri knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. And yet, he was powerless to get it out of his mind.\nHe had found a trail of old forum posts supposedly written by a college student. The student, who used the online pseudonym Jadusable, had bought a strange copy of a Nintendo 64 video game at a yard sale. It was The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a notoriously dark instalment in the Zelda franchise, released 25 years ago this week on 27 April 2000.\nMajora's Mask is full of unnerving discussions about death, denial, fear, regret \u2013 and a looming apocalypse. But something was off about the cartridge Jadusable found. It had no label, just \"Majora\" scribbled on the plastic in marker. And something was seriously wrong with it.\nJadusable wrote that the game's familiar graphics were strange and distorted. Music played backwards in a spine-chilling loop. Worst of all, he was plagued by a terrifying statue of the main character, Link, with a petrified grimace on its face. It kept appearing in the game out of nowhere \u2013 like a digital ghost. On YouTube, Jadusable posted video evidence of everything he had described. This game cartridge, it seemed, was haunted \u2013 inhabited by the spirit of its former owner, a child named Ben who had drowned in a tragic accident. Johri pored over every detail, rapt with morbid curiosity.\nAs the story unfolded through roughly 11,000-words of forum entries posted over the course of weeks, Jadusable described a haunting that soon extended beyond the game to other areas of his life. Eventually, after a series of increasingly disturbing experiences, the forum posts ceased, and Jadusable was never heard from again. This urban legend burst onto the web in 2010, traumatising a generation of young internet users. It became known as \"Ben Drowned\".\nBen Drowned left an indelible mark on the web and continues to spawn art and fan fiction long after it emerged. Though lesser-known outside gaming circles, the story and its accompanying videos racked up millions of views and have inspired other narratives in a similar vein.\nAt its core, Ben Drowned is a story about a ghost in a machine \u2013 one that speaks to our deepest fears about new technology. But it's more than an effective urban legend. Ben Drowned is a myth born from a medium that shaped a generation. In an era when video games were still often seen as a frivolous pastime for children, Ben Drowned was early proof that society's relationship with video games goes beyond childhood nostalgia, tapping into our deepest emotions \u2013 and maybe even our souls.\nBy the time Johri stumbled on Ben Drowned in around 2015, it was already widely acknowledged as fiction. But that didn't matter. That night, on Christmas Eve, as Johri lay in bed wrestling with insomnia, he could see in his mind's eye that creepy statue's grimace projected onto the faces of his family members. Rumour had it that Ben, the ghost from the corrupted Majora's Mask cartridge, had gone on to torment other people besides Jadusable. That's what the adolescent Johri couldn't shake, however irrational it seemed. The idea that Ben's evil presence might be out there. That it could spread.\nYears earlier, in September 2010, a real-life college student called Alex Hall hit \"publish\" on a forum post that would change his life forever. Hall had just started his second year at Saint Louis University in Missouri, US. He wasn't a fan of college. Here was his first taste of freedom as a so-called adult, and yet there were still all these classes to attend. He dreamt of becoming a famous author.\nAt the time, content called \"copypastas\" had become popular on forums such as 4chan and Something Awful. The term refers to the practice of copying and pasting blocks of text online, an early means of going viral \u2013 if such text proved popular enough to be shared widely. Ben Drowned is a canonical entry in an influential subgenre of copypasta called \"creepypasta\" \u2013 horror stories whose origins often become obscured as they spread across the web, thus adding to the mystery. Slender Man, a legend that was eventually turned into a big budget movie, is probably the most famous example.\nBy 2010, creepypastas had become extremely popular. But few of these stories concerned video games \u2013 despite the significance of games as cultural artefacts by that point. There were some examples, though, such as Polybius \u2013 a story that spread online in the early 2000s about mythical arcade game said to be part of a US government conspiracy.\nHall decided that the internet was missing something: an in-depth, video game-themed creepypasta. Gradually, his idea began to form: a haunted cartridge, a series of hoax-like forum posts, a narrator targeted by the evil entity within the game, and videos to back up these claims.\nHall knew how to make such videos using software to mod (modify) a game. He chose to use that software on Majora's Mask, Hall's favourite at the time. \"That game, to me, felt like the most alive video game that I had ever played, really,\" he says. Characters talk at length about their grief, or express denial about their impending doom, even while the moon, which is on a collision course with the world, edges closer and closer overhead. \"They have hopes and dreams,\" adds Hall.\nThe tale Hall came up with developed and amplified the grim mood of Majora's Mask, using the game as a springboard for a folk story about a troubled gamer. Hall's narrative leans on ominous lines of dialogue from the game. Most notably: \"You shouldn't have done that.\"\nThe idea of a haunted Nintendo 64 cartridge came in part from Hall's own experience of trawling through yard sales for video games. He once found a copy of Star Wars Episode I: Racer, based on the pod-racing sequence from that film. \"I was so bad at that game,\" recalls Hall. But the copy he found had a complete save file on it from the previous owner, meaning he could play as all the racers without having to unlock them first. This planted the seed that old game cartridges sometimes harboured surprises.\n\"A big part of gamer culture has always been about finding the secrets in different games,\" says John Sanders, assistant professor of English who studies media and literature at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, US. But while gamers seek to master the games they play, Ben Drowned is about a nightmare opposite scenario \u2013 this is a game that will master you.\nSanders points out that people have long told stories about corrupted or haunted media. The possessed game cartridge is just the latest in a line that includes ghostly radio broadcasts, cursed videotapes and demonic books. In Ben Drowned, Hall dangled the possibility that Ben might be able to haunt the reader too, via their computer. Another age-old ghost story trope: you're next.\nAfter months of toil, Hall finally published his creation. A few days later, he woke up and logged on, bleary-eyed, to his YouTube channel. The first video he'd posted for the story had jumped up to nearly 2,000 views. Hall had never had such a response online before, and the view counter just kept ticking upwards. He picked up the phone and called his father. \"Dad,\" Hall croaked, \"I think I've done something here.\"\n\"I actually remember reading it in my dorm room in college and sending it to some of my friends,\" says Alexander Zawacki, a digital humanities lecturer at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Germany, who describes the thrill of discovering creepypastas through links shared on internet forums. Readers felt as though they were \"getting into something a little bit secret\", he adds.\nZawacki is one of a few researchers who have published academic papers about Ben Drowned. It is a classic example of a spooky story that employs childhood nostalgia, he says \u2013 like horror films peppered with dolls, clowns and little children. \"They feel like relics of the past that come back to haunt you,\" says Zawacki.\nBen Drowned is a story that proves video games can be just as evocative.\nThat's significant, says Sanders. As video games matured, gaining more sophisticated graphics, complex characters and intricate storylines, they have given rise to entire subcultures \u2013 ardent gamers who trade knowledge about lore, cheat codes or hidden loot. They spend many hours exploring the digital worlds in the games they adore and sharing tales about the things they've seen that most people wouldn't believe.\nGamers' obsessions were leading to a \"boiling point\", adds Sanders, where a story like Ben Drowned had the chance of achieving real success.\nSanders also argues that Ben Drowned didn't just creep people out, it quite likely influenced later examples of urban legends about video games including Herobrine, a creepy, white-eyed character that supposedly appeared in Minecraft (but never actually did) and \"PBBV\", an evil spirit said to inhabit the virtual reality world of the game Gorilla Tag.\nThe creator of YouTube horror series Petscop, about a fictitious PlayStation One game that turns increasingly dark as the protagonist plays it, says he drew inspiration from Ben Drowned, among other sources.\nBen Drowned, which was first and foremost a text-based narrative complemented by video content, might seem anachronistic today. Zawacki says it's now more common to find stories like this presented in video-only formats.\nGaming writer and podcaster Marn Silverman, argues that while the delivery of Ben Drowned was \"of its time\", the story appears to have influenced a raft of video games built around the concept that they are possessed in one way or another \u2013 such as No Players Online, a supposedly haunted first-person shooter.\nIt's not surprising that a lot of these stories and games play on the nostalgia theme, says Emily Crawford, a digital media specialist in Washington DC who wrote about Ben Drowned while studying film and electronic media in graduate school. Games of the Nintendo 64 era, with their jagged, somewhat primitive 3D graphics, are especially good fodder for 21st Century ghost stories.\n\"The clunkier early technology left a lot more room for things to go wrong,\" Crawford says.\nTechnologies that are fallible have long given rise to anxiety and alarm. Ben Drowned is \"an articulation of the fears of the internet age\", says Sanders. \"Viruses, corruption, the blurring of the boundary between me at the computer and the computer itself.\"\nBen's desperation to haunt someone, and to spread to other people's computers via the internet, is a kind of demonic \"virality\", adds Sanders. It fits existing worries about the web and what we might find there, giving the concept an unsettling plausibility.\nFor many, experiences with Ben Drowned as a child were formative. Charlie Duke, a college student in the US, was around eight when he first heard about the story. He found a video about Ben Drowned and that, a mere summary of the original creepypasta, was enough to chill him to the bone.\n\"I immediately closed the video,\" he recalls. \"It got so stuck in my mind, it gave me anxiety for a long time.\" He even deleted a version of Majora's Mask he had on his computer, just to be safe. Duke says the ghost story played a significant role in debilitating anxiety attacks he suffered in the following years. He'd freeze up, hyperventilate and go completely pale. \"It was always looking for a trigger and Ben Drowned happened to be one of those triggers, or even the main one at the time.\"\nSaarthak Johri was also long-troubled by the story. The unnerving statue in the story that seemingly represented Ben's ghost, and the idea that he or his family members could be petrified in a similar way \"freaked me out so much\", he says.\nHall is aware that, for some people, Ben Drowned felt a little too real. \"That stuff sucks,\" he says, adding that accounts like Duke's have made him feel a little guilty at times. \"I want to tell people a story, I don't actually want to cause trauma.\"\nDespite the unpleasant experiences that Johri and Duke say they had after reading Ben Drowned, both have positive things to say about it today. \"It was kind of the first thing that connected me to other people in my middle school,\" says Johri. \"You have litmus tests for how online or digital people might be and knowing about these creepypastas is one of them.\"\nDuke says that Majora's Mask is one of his favourite games of all time. He has revisited Ben Drowned in the years since his first brush with the story and he notes that therapy has helped him to better understand and control his anxiety. \"It allowed me to look at myself in ways I don't think a lot of people my age [did],\" Duke says. \"I don't know if would thank Ben Drowned for that, but it definitely played a part.\"\nFor Hall, writing an internet ghost story has led to other ventures including a new YouTube series he plans to release later this year called Dead Save, featuring alternate versions of classic video games. As with Ben Drowned, he'll use modding tools to edit those original games and bring to life urban myths about them that have circled online. He also says he would love to release a playable version of the haunted Majora's Mask cartridge one day.\nBut, reflecting on Ben Drowned 15 years after its original publication, there's something else to consider. While ghost stories about technology and video games remain popular, Sanders points out that we are all, these days, very used to the idea that there could be some malevolent actor trying to control our computer or harm us through our devices. Whether that's an email scam, social media bots, ransomware or people targeting us with disinformation or abusive content.\nThe threat lurking within technology isn't demonic, it's us. The \"fantastic\" supernaturalism of Ben Drowned seems almost quaint in comparison.\n\"Now we're just like, 'Oh yeah, it's out there, there are Bens out there waiting to happen, waiting to control our computers',\" says Sanders. \"We just don't think they're fantastic anymore.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

It weighed heavily on his mind.\nThe 28-year-old German was beaten by American qualifier Learner Tien in the Acapulco second round, by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor in the Indian Wells second round, and by France's Arthur Fils in the Miami Open fourth round.\nLosing his opening match in Monte Carlo did irreparable damage, rendering his Munich title insignificant in his pursuit of Sinner.\nZverev believes the possibility of becoming world number one did not have an impact.\n\"I was just playing bad, to be honest,\" he said.\n\"Australia did affect me and there was a lot of things that, in my mind, I was not playing well.\"\nAlcaraz, already a four-time major champion before his 22nd birthday, had even further ground to make up.\nThe Spaniard started positively by winning the Rotterdam title, but a series of defeats in Doha, Indian Wells and - most damningly - Miami halted his momentum.\nIt meant Alcaraz was unable to regain top spot, even though he went on to win Monte Carlo and reach the Barcelona final last month.\nConstant talk of chasing Sinner had a negative influence on him.\n\"Since Jannik's ban started, a lot of people asked me about how important the moment was to reach number one again,\" said Alcaraz.\n\"I was thinking too much about it, instead of playing my good tennis and enjoying the time that I stepped on the court.\"\nInstead of another dominant player emerging, Sinner's absence produced a carousel of champions - including Britain's Jack Draper and Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, who both won their first Masters titles.\nIt means Sinner returns to an ATP Tour that has been blown wide open.\nWith Alcaraz injured and 37-year-old Novak Djokovic struggling, the current landscape appears to provide an opportunity for Sinner - who reached the French Open semi-finals last year - to hit the ground running.\nInside the doping deal for tennis' world number one\nSinner does not deserve any hate - Draper\nSinner is sure to receive a hero's welcome when he returns at the Italian Open.\nSupport from his compatriots has never wavered during the doping controversy, demonstrated by the 'Sinnermania' which swept the ATP Finals in Turin last year.\nThe man from the mountains in northern Italy enjoyed the greatest season of his career in 2024 - and one of the best in recent memory - so it is little wonder he is held in high esteem at home.\nThe reception might be frostier in the locker room, however.\nSinner has talked about how he felt \"uncomfortable\" around his peers at the Australian Open.\n\"It was a bit like some players looked at me differently and I didn't like it at all,\" he told Italian broadcaster RAI.\nThree-time major champion Stan Wawrinka was among many players who criticised  the way Sinner's case was handled, while plenty of others felt the timing of his ban was convenient.\nBritish number one Draper was one of a few players who did publicly back Sinner, reiterating his support in late April and saying the Italian \"doesn't deserve any hate\".\nWhile Sinner is not allowed to play competitively until Monday, he has been able to play some tennis.\nFrom the start of the ban until 13 April, he could practise at a private training base - as long as he did not come into contact with other professional players.\nSpeculation surfaced in March he had been hitting with Dominic Thiem - the recently retired 2020 US Open champion - after the pair were pictured having dinner together in Monte Carlo.\nHowever, Thiem laughed off the suggestion.\n\"I think for him and his level, I would not be [good] enough,\" Thiem told BBC Sport.\nUnder Wada rules, Sinner could start 'official training activity' from 13 April.\nSinner invited Draper - a friend he has played doubles with on the ATP Tour - to Monte Carlo for several days of practice sessions on the clay.\nAsked about Sinner's level, Draper told BBC Sport: \"He's very consistent, he's playing great.\n\"Maybe a little rusty in some areas, but with time he's improving every day. The more points we played, the more he was getting better.\n\"It was great to be around him for a few days and get some good sparring.\"\nSinner attended a Gucci event alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour during Milan Fashion Week in February\nSinner was surrounded by his trusted team in Monaco - coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill, plus fitness trainer Marco Panichi, physio Ulises Badio and osteopath Andrea Cipolla.\nDraper said the trip was strictly business.\n\"I didn't speak to him too much to be honest,\" added the 23-year-old world number six, who lost to Sinner in last year's US Open semi-finals.\n\"On the court, Jannik is always very professional \u2013 he's number one for a reason.\n\"He seemed in good spirits, had a great team around him and great people who have supported him through a tough time.\"\nOnce Draper moved on to the Madrid Open, Sinner enlisted the help of Norwegian teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer in practice sessions.\nOff the court, Sinner has spent time with his family back in Italy and has pursued his other interests outside tennis.\nShortly after the announcement of his ban, he was pictured sitting alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Milan Fashion Week.\nAccording to a source close to Sinner, the player has been enjoying skiing, biking and go-karting between tennis sessions in recent weeks.\n\"I think he is feeling refreshed \u2013 tennis is very relentless.

        "article_text": "Lando Norris won the Miami sprint race on Saturday before the qualifying session\nMiami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Date: 4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nMcLaren's Lando Norris said he was \"very happy\" after qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix, despite losing out on pole position to Max Verstappen.\nNorris ended up 0.065 seconds from the Red Bull driver and, while his satisfaction was mixed with some frustration, it was based on his feeling that he has made progress with some of the problems with which he has been struggling this season.\nThe Briton has been open about the fact he finds his McLaren car does not 'talk to him' in the way he would like when being pushed to the absolute limit on a qualifying lap.\nAnd while he again made a mistake that he felt cost him pole position, their communication has been better this weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium.\nNorris, who won Saturday's sprint race, said that \"Max did a Max lap once again and I can't fault him\". So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well.

        "article_text": "Astronomers have spotted around a dozen of these weird, rare blasts. Could they be signs of a special kind of black hole?\nAstronomers had never seen anything like it before \u2013 something vast, in the depths of space, went boom. Telescopes on Earth picked up the astonishingly bright and unusual explosion in 2018, watching as it played out 200 million light years away.\nThe blast brightened rapidly and brilliantly, far more than one would expect for a regular star explosion, a supernova, before it disappeared. Given the label AT2018cow, the weird-looking blast \u2013 which was about the same size as our solar system \u2013 soon become known by a more memorable nickname: \"the Cow\".\nSince this dazzling event, astronomers have detected a handful of other, similar explosions across the cosmos. Described as luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBots), they all share the same characteristics.\n\"They are very luminous,\" says Anna Ho, an astronomer at Cornell University in New York, hence the L in LFBot. The blue colour is a result of the explosion's extraordinarily high temperature of around 40,000C (72,000F), which shifts light to the blue part of the spectrum. The last letters in the acronym, O and T, refer to the fact these events appear in the visible light spectrum (optical) and are short-lived (transient).\nInitially, scientists thought LFBots might be failed supernovae, stars that tried to explode but instead imploded, forming a black hole at their core that subsequently consumed them from the inside-out.\nHowever, another theory is gaining traction \u2013 that cow flares are triggered when an undiscovered class of mid-sized black holes, known as intermediate mass black holes, swallow up stars that stray too close to them. A research paper published in November last year described fresh evidence for this idea, suggesting that it might be the preferred explanation. \"The general sentiment is shifting in that direction,\" says Daniel Perley, an astronomer at Liverpool John Moores University.\nIf this turns out to be correct, it could provide vital proof of the existence of this elusive type of black hole \u2013 a missing link between the smallest and largest black holes in the Universe and a vital clue to one of its biggest mysteries, dark matter.\nThe original cow flare in 2018 was detected by a robotic survey of the sky that uses Earth-based telescopes called the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (Atlas). This system caught the explosion occurring in a galaxy about 200 million light-years from Earth. Noticeably, it was up to 100 times brighter than a regular supernova, and it came and went in just a few days. Normal supernovae take weeks or even months to run their course. This explosion also had a strange, flat structure, according to a observations by researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK.\nSince then, astronomers have identified about a dozen similar events. Most have also become known by animal-themed nicknames loosely based on the letters they are randomly assigned by the astronomical survey that discovers them. ZTF18abvkwla, also witnessed in 2018, is called the Koala. ZTF20acigmel, spotted in 2020, is known as the Camel. AT2022tsd, found in 2022, is the Tasmanian devil. And 2023's AT2023fhn is called the Finch or Fawn.\nAstronomers have increasingly been using telescope surveys to study large portions of the sky in an effort seek out these events. When one flares up, they can then send an alert out to other astronomers on services such as the Astronomer's Telegram, a kind of online message board for astronomical events. Such alerts aim to prompt other telescopes into action, pointing them towards the event in the hope of observing it in detail before the blast fades from view.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Where do Earth-threatening asteroids come from?\n\u2022\u00a0The search for our Sun's missing twin\n\u2022\u00a0Stupendously large: How big can black holes get?\nIn November, Ho and Perley discovered another new LFBot, this time designated AT2024wpp, but has yet to gain a nickname. \"We were thinking 'the Wasp',\" says Ho. This explosion was particularly interesting because it was the brightest LFBot observed since the Cow, and it was also discovered very early on in its brightening phase, meaning astronomers could train lots of telescopes on it \u2013 including the Hubble space telescope \u2013 in order to learn more about it. \"It's the best one since the Cow itself,\" says Perley.\nEarly observations hint that the Wasp was not caused by a failed supernova. In that theorised scenario, a star would collapse in on itself while in the process of exploding. Inside the star's shell, a black hole or a dense neutron star would then form, and blast out jets of radiation through the shell, creating what's called a central engine. This would explain the brief cow flare that was visible on Earth.\nBut the Wasp seemed to lack any sign of material flowing away from the explosion that scientists would expect from such an event, says Perley. However, he notes that current findings are preliminary. \"We're still analysing the data,\" he says.\nIn September 2024, Zheng Cao at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research and colleagues re-examined the first detected LFBot, and also found evidence that challenged the failed supernova theory.\nBy studying X-ray observations of the event, they found what appeared to be a disk of material surrounding the explosion. After making a computer model of the disk, they found that it looked like the remnants of a star that was being eaten by an intermediate mass black hole, one about 100 to 100,000 times the mass of our Sun. Larger black holes could have a mass millions or even billions of times greater than our Sun. (Find out just how big black holes can get in this article about the largest black holes in the Universe.)\u00a0\nAs the star was eaten, it would occasionally cause the black hole to suddenly brighten as larger chunks of the star were consumed, producing the Cow flares spotted by astronomers on Earth.\n\"I believe our study supports the intermediate mass black holes nature of AT2018cow and similar LFBots,\" says Cao.\nAnother idea is that LFBots are actually a class of giant stars called Wolf-Rayet stars that are being torn apart by much smaller black holes only 10 to 100 times the mass of our Sun. Brian Metzger, a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University in New York, is among those who support this idea. He says these could form in a similar way to pairs of black holes \u2013 which have been detected by the gravitational waves they produce \u2013 except on this occasion only one of the stars becomes a black hole.\nThe intermediate mass black holes theory is perhaps the most alluring and favoured idea at the moment, though. If correct, it would mean that LFBots are a unique opportunity for us to study mysterious mid-sized black holes. While astronomers are reasonably confident that intermediate mass black holes exist in the Universe, no-one has yet found definitive proof for them.\nAnd they could be extremely important, acting as the missing link between the smallest black holes in the cosmos and the largest, supermassive black holes such as the one at the centre of our own galaxy. LFBots could reveal the locations of intermediate mass black holes, and how common they are.\n\"The intermediate mass black hole model is the most exciting,\" says Perley. \"It is still kind of debated in the community whether intermediate mass black holes really exist. The evidence has been quire sparing.\"\nTo find out for certain what LFBots are, we really need a much larger sample of them. \"Unfortunately, they're really rare,\" says Perley. Data on around 100 of them would be an ideal next step, he adds. We might get a little closer to that number next year, when an Israeli orbital telescope called the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (Ultrasat) is set to launch. It is expected to find many more LFBots among other cosmic transients, thanks to its very large field of view of 204 square degrees, equivalent to seeing 1,000 full Moons.\nOther space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), could gather more data about singular LFBots so long as they could be trained in the direction of an explosion while it is brightening. \"JWST would be perfect,\" says Metzger. However, getting time on the telescope to do such observations has proved difficult. \"I proposed this two times,\" says Ho, but she had no luck. \"I'll try again this year.\"\nUntil more data arrives, the mystery of these strange explosions will linger. What is clear is that LFBots have proved far more unusual than anyone expected.\n\"I thought this was going to be a fun, one-off project,\" says Perley. \"But it turned out to really be this completely separate type of phenomenon. They have become more and more interesting.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.\n\"Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).\"\nOne former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.\n\"There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,\" they told the BBC.\nM&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.\nAs a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.\n\"They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.\n\"I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.\"\nGreencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.\nM&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.\nOne food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.\n\"The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.\"\nBut he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.\nGed Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.\n\"If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.\"\nBut the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.\nThe company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.\nThe chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was \"imperative\" to understand what had happened.\nOne person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.\n\"Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.\"\nM&S has been contacted for comment. \nAdditional reporting by Kris Bramwell ",

        "article_text": "Robots for training carers, sensors that monitor people as they sleep and an app that can detect if someone is in pain - could this be the future of care?\nThe care sector is increasingly using technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to look after the UK's ever-growing elderly population.\nDespite this, experts have urged people to consider the potential risks of an overreliance on AI in the industry.\n\"AI can only be part of the solution but not the whole solution,\" says Dr Caroline Green from the University of Oxford.\nMs Green, the director of research at the Institute for Ethics in AI, spoke at an AI in Social Care Summit at the university in March.\nShe highlighted how AI systems could be susceptible to biases, which amplify discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping and has also recognised the worries people have around sharing their personal data with the technology.\n\"At the moment there's no official government policy on guidance on the use of AI in social care,\" Ms Green added.\nShe said: \"Whether it's going to be good for people who need support, depends on how policy is going to shape up here, it depends on what choices people will continue to have in the future, or whether they can for example opt out of having AI in their care at all, it will depend on whether there is going to be a sense in which AI technology can take over care provision and human interaction. \n\"We need to be very careful here on what choices people will have in the future and what the future of social care with AI will look like.\"\nThomas Tredinnick is the boss of AllyCares that uses sensors to monitor care home residents' rooms overnight, listening out for anything out of the ordinary.\nIt sends an audio recording of any incidents to carers on shift, who can then decide how to act.\nSpeaking from Oaklands Rest Home in Southampton, which uses the technology, Mr Tredinnick said it saves staff having to perform regular nightly checks, meaning residents can get a better sleep.\n\"The care staff are providing care to the residents that need it,\" he said.\nHe claims it has helped to reduce preventable health events leading to hospital admissions, as it spots things like falls and chest infections before they escalate.\nChristine Herbert said her 99-year-old mother Betty is one of the residents being monitored by the technology.\nShe admitted she was uncertain about the use of AI at first, comparing the technology to a \"baby monitor\".\n\"When mum came here for the first few nights I did ask for routine checks because I was concerned,\" she said.\nMrs Herbert said she came around to the technology after the home presented her with data which showed how her mother was monitored and not disturbed during the night.\nAt Elmbrook Court care home in Wantage, Oxfordshire, they are using AI to find out if residents are in pain.\nAislinn Mullee, deputy manager at the home, said: \"It can be quite difficult to identify pain in a resident that is non-verbal.\"\nUsing a smartphone app called Painchek, carers scan a resident's face for pain indicators, answer questions about the resident and then receive an instant percentage score which indicates the level of pain that person is feeling.\nMs Mullee said it has made a \"huge difference\" and they have used the information in collaboration with local GPs to assess which pain medication a resident requires.\nShe added it has also been used to reassure family members that a loved one receiving end-of-life care was not in pain.\nMs Mullee made clear the data gathered was password-protected and only visible to staff at the home.\nAt the University of Oxford's Robotics Institute they are hoping AI could also be used to train carers.\nMarco Pontin, a Post Doctoral Research Assistant, is part of a team which has created a robot which reacts to human touch.\nIt can be programmed to feel pain in different parts of its body and will physically flinch if a carer is too forceful when touching a painful area.\nIt will be trialled with students studying to be occupational therapists at Oxford Brookes University.\nMr Pontin said the team hoped to use it as a \"digital twin\" of real life patients.\nIt will be programmed with the same conditions as a human patient so that carers \"can replicate whatever they have seen in the real world but with the robot counterpart\".\nHe said: \"With an ever-growing ageing population it's harder to be there for everyone, so providing a digital twin of a patient could enable occupational therapists to know what is going on with their various patients without necessarily being there all of the time.\" \nPeople are living longer and there are an estimated 12 million people in the UK aged 67 or over, with that figure projected to rise to 13.7m by 2032.\nA report published by the House of Commons library in March stated in 2023/24, local authorities in England spent \u00a323.3bn on adult social care, which was the second biggest area of council spending after education.\nThe sector's reliance on workers from overseas is another big issue.\nHome Office statistics showed 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care, in the 12 months to December 2024.\nThis was a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules.\n\"We're reliant on migrant workers to keep social care going at the moment,\" says Lee-Ann Fenge, professor of social care at Bournemouth University.\nShe said she does not believe new technology should be used as a way of filling the gaps in the sector.\nShe said \"It needs to be seen as a tool that enhances the work that is already happening.\"\nShe added time needed to be taken to \"think about some of the ethical challenges\" that monitoring people could have.\n\"We need to prepare people better to protect themselves, so this isn't just about saying AI is wonderful, let's use it. We need to look at both the potentials of AI but also the risks that it could pose,\" she said.\nIn February, the UK and US governments refused to sign an international AI declaration in Paris, which pledged an \"open\", \"inclusive\" and \"ethical\" approach to the technology's development.\nThis comes as the government announced in March it will take a \"test and learn\" approach to funding AI in the public sector, in order to \"push innovation\".\nWhen catching up with Dr Caroline Green again she continues to promote a cautious approach to AI.\n\"It can help with some of the administrative work, some of the operation of care, but it cannot replace that human touch,\" she said.\n\"There is a potential risk that AI is going to be seen as a panacea to some of those very big problems that we are seeing in social care provision, namely that we don't have enough staff, and that there is a growing demand from an ageing population.\n\"I think here we really need to make sure that we don't just invest in AI to take over care-giving but that we keep on investing in people, in professionals who will be able to provide that care.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \"We will harness cutting-edge technology to transform social care and we are already seeing promising developments across the sector - from AI-powered fall detection systems that provide earlier interventions, to tools which automate paperwork to free up staff to focus on caring for people.\n\"Making better use of AI in social care is exactly the kind of transformation we're championing in our 10 Year Health Plan \u2013 shifting from treating sickness to preventing it, from hospital to community care, and from analogue to digital solutions.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.\nThis is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.\nAt the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to establish that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.\nThe BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.\nSo far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.\n20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.\nAmong the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.\nThey had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.\nBairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.\nIn February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.\nOkhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.\nUnlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.\nIn total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.\nA few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.\nThere was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.\nA relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"\nIn our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.\nIn the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.\nIn 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.\nIn the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.\nIn 2023, the number rose to 37,633.\nIn 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.\nIn August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.\nHowever, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.\n\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.\nAfter almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.\nAccording to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.\nEven then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.\nThe cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.\nActual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.\nOverall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land. This means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.\nRussia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.\n\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.\nOne-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.\nWe also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.\nVolunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.\nIn 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.\nOne Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.\nThe one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).\nCalculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.\nThis is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.\nThe true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.\nAn assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.\nThat would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.",

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri claimed victory in Miami to make it three wins in a row, beating team-mate Lando Norris in a McLaren one-two.\nPiastri now leads the drivers' championship by 16 points from Norris.\nMeanwhile, Ferrari were embroiled in a controversy over team orders after Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc were both asked to swap positions.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions after the Miami Grand Prix.\nWhat on earth is wrong at Ferrari? - Jonathan\nAfter the Miami Grand Prix, the questions in Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur's news conference focused largely on the team orders debate between the team and drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc during the race.\nVasseur became a little frustrated with this, and in the end said: \"It's not the story of the day,\" pointing out that the only difference it made in the end was which driver finished seventh and eighth.\n\"I would be much more keen to speak about why we finished one minute behind McLaren,\" he said.\nVasseur claimed that in the race, the car's pace was a match for the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the Mercedes, but Ferrari paid the price for their poor grid positions. McLaren, he admitted, were \"on another planet\".\nCharles Leclerc qualified eighth and Lewis Hamilton 12th, Ferrari's worst qualifying result of the season, and that was largely because they were struggling to get the best out of new tyres.\nThat's why Hamilton and Leclerc ran on used tyres in the second set of qualifying. As Vasseur put it: \"Everybody improved 0.5-0.6secs between scrubbed to new and we lost 0.2-0.3secs.\"\nAsked why Ferrari struggled with tyres in Miami, he said: \"That's a good question. If I knew the answer, I would do a step forward and we would have fixed it between Q2 and Q3.\n\"You always have to operate the tyres in a very narrow window. It's different from track to track, it's different from compound to compound, from track temp to track temp. And it's always after the session that you say, 'OK, I could have done differently.'\"\nBut that was just Miami. The wider issue is that the car is not where Ferrari expected it to be at the start of this season, after running McLaren so close for the constructors' title last year. \nOther teams - especially McLaren - made more progress over the winter, and Ferrari simply need to make the car faster.\nOn average, it is the slowest of the top four teams, and Ferrari have scored only one grand prix podium, thanks to Leclerc in Saudi Arabia.\nHamilton won the sprint in China, but that seems to be a case of him and the team finding a good set-up after just one practice session, while others did not, and then benefiting from clean air at the start of the race.\nAs Leclerc put it: \"Lewis did an outstanding job. Maybe some drivers didn't put everything together in (sprint) qualifying and he managed to do that and managed to outperform the car a bit. \n\"Then tyre degradation being a big thing, when you start in front, everything comes to you a bit more. Lewis made a difference on Friday and Saturday.\"\nThere are what Vasseur calls \"some small upgrades\" coming at the next two races in Imola and Monaco. And Vasseur hopes that the stricter rules on front wing deflection that are being introduced at the subsequent race in Spain will make a difference. \n\"Everybody will have a new front wing in Barcelona,\" he said. \"By definition and by regulation. I think it will be perhaps a reset of the performance of everybody.\"\nThe implication is that McLaren are benefiting from exploiting this phenomenon. McLaren themselves say they expect it to make little difference to them.\nFerrari progressed well with upgrades in both 2023 and 2024 after difficult starts. Vasseur remains confident they can do the same this year.\nHamilton said on Sunday: \"I feel optimistic for the future. I think this car really does have performance. Something's holding us back at the moment. We've lost performance since China. And it's there, it's just we can't use it. Until we get a fix for that, then this is where we are.\"\n'Fire in my belly' led to team orders controversy - Hamilton\nVerstappen 'not racing very smart' - Norris\nIs the risk that Mercedes took bringing Kimi Antonelli into the team now rather than later paying off? \u2013 Callum\nKimi Antonelli had had a steady start to his debut Formula 1 season, as he said was his plan from the start - he wanted to build steadily and not make big errors.\nIn Miami, the 18-year-old for the first time showed a glimpse of the high potential Mercedes believed him to have, and which persuaded them to throw him in at the deep end this year.\nHe was confident in the car from the start, and he was always the faster Mercedes driver over one lap.\nPole for the sprint race was an outstanding performance, and he repeated it with third on the grid for the grand prix. Neither race went as well, but team principal Toto Wolff believes that was evidence of Antonelli's continued need to learn in the complex world of F1.\nWolff described the qualifying performances as \"another proof of his talent and a good indication of how the future can be\".\nHe added: \"In the race, challenging, because it's so difficult here to find the right reference. The medium (tyre) stint, quick enough, you know, with George (Russell) holding on in the back on the hard tyre.\n\"And then when he went into the hard, he just lacked experience managing it the right way.\n\"(We're) finding the right references and trying to guide him, but when you're in that car, it's not easy. It's just part of the learning curve.\"\nWolff always said that it would take time for Antonelli to adapt to F1, and that's the way it is working out.\nAntonelli has a long way to go before he proves he is the generational talent Mercedes - and others who have worked with him in the junior categories - believe him to be, but Miami was a good step in the right direction.\nKimi Antonelli finished sixth in the main grand prix in Miami and seventh in the sprint race\nHow can Fernando Alonso turn his season around, having not scored a single point up until now? \u2013 Andrew\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso is not having his best season, and it's highly unusual to see that he has scored no points while team-mate Lance Stroll has scored 14 points and is 10th in the championship.\nThe bottom line is that the Aston Martin is a poor car. Alonso has made a couple of mistakes, but fundamentally he has been unlucky and Stroll has benefited from circumstances.\nAlonso is still comfortably faster than the Canadian - the two-time champion is 7-1 ahead across all qualifying sessions at an average advantage of 0.321 seconds.\nHe was driving well in Australia in the wet in an impressive sixth place, but crashed on gravel at Turn Six. The chaos in the race helped Stroll, driving well, to move up and claim that sixth place.\nStroll then benefited from the disqualification of both Ferraris in China, and was promoted to ninth place. There, Alonso retired early on with his brakes on fire.\nStroll benefited again from the chaos in the Miami sprint, where Alonso was driving well and on course for points when he was taken out in a crash with Liam Lawson.\nHis spin in the grand prix, while uncharacteristic, \"didn't change anything,\" he said. \n\"I lost five seconds and then 10 laps later I catch the same group of cars and was still in the same place and then benefited from the virtual safety car. \n\"Even with that, not enough (pace) to be closer to the cars in front today. We need to get better for Imola. We are not happy being at this pace but we are all trying the best we can.\"\nAston Martin team boss Andy Cowell praised Alonso's qualifying performance in Japan as \"outstanding\" and in Jeddah as \"impressive\". But with no retirements, Alonso finished just out of the points in both races.\nThe reality is that the car is eighth fastest in qualifying on average and in Miami was the slowest of all. So scoring points is always going to be difficult.\nCowell said in Miami that Aston Martin were \"not a happy camp and we're trying to work out (what has gone wrong)\".\nAlonso was frustrated Aston Martin had rejected his calls for an earlier change to slicks in the sprint on Saturday in Miami, and said on Sunday: \"I am trying to do my best behind the wheel.\n\"I nailed Japan, P11. Jeddah was nearly perfect. As I said (before), we have three or four opportunities when chaos happens and you have the opportunity to score points.\n\"There were three already this year. Australia, and I had the mistake and went on the gravel and went off. China, with three or four cars disqualified, and I had brakes on fire on lap one.\n\"And yesterday the track was for dry tyres and we kept with the inters for too long.\n\"We missed three opportunities to score points in my case and it is going to be one or two more in the season. I guess let's hope for some more.\"\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nAlpine poised to replace Doohan with Colapinto\nAudi announces second management restructure\nMiami Grand Prix review",

Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. \nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.\nIt is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.\nHowever, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.\nThe UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.\nOne of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.\nThe British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.\nBut it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.\nThis agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.\nThe UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily.\n\"It opens up a small number of visas from an existing route for chefs and musicians and yoga teachers, very, very small, about 1,800,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for India's security forces and diplomats.\nThis is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nAnd before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.\nEach time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.\nSince 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.\nOnce again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.\n\"There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,\" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.\nYet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \"This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,\" he explains.\n\"We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nA week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.\nDelhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)\n\nIn his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019. \nHe was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.\nMr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.\nThey included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.\n\"How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,\" Mr Bisaria writes.\n\"All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.\"\nThe strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive. \nA day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing. \nIndia's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's \"autonomous terror list\".\nWhile there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution. \nAt the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a \"false-flag operation\".\nMuch like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 \"overground workers\" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.\nIn a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that \"that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited\".\n\"She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,\" Mr Bisaria writes. \nOn 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.\nSix hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed \"a very large number\" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.\nThe crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.\nIn the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.\nMr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was \"any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.\"\nPakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a \"goodwill gesture\" aimed at de-escalating tensions.\nBy 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.\n\"I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,\" Mr Bisaria writes,\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.\"\nMr Bisaria described it as a \"testing and fascinating time\" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred \"ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved\".\nHe views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a \"de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct\". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.\n\"The body language and optics are similar [this time],\" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. \"If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.\"\n\"Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action.\"",

        "article_text": "London is Europe's wealthiest city, yet for many living in the capital, having a place to call home feels out of reach, according to the Centre for London (CfL).\nEarlier this week, the independent think tank hosted the London Housing Summit, highlighting the challenges of - and possible solutions to - the housing crisis, which it says is \"spiralling out of control\".\nExperts agree it is a complex issue, but what do figures show us about the scale of the problem?\nAccording to data collected by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), there was an 8% increase in rough sleeping in the capital on the same period in 2024.\nNew rough sleepers account for almost half (47%) of the total number of those sleeping rough, intermittent rough sleepers account for 39% and 16% of the recorded number of rough sleepers were living on the streets.\nCHAIN's latest annual report for 2024/25 reveals rough sleeping in London has reached an \"all time high\".\nThe Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in London by 2030, and in January 2025 he announced an additional \u00a310m investment in a bid to achieve this goal.\nThe money will go towards expanding the network of its Ending Homelessness Hubs, which provide 24/7 specialist support for people new to rough sleeping and prevention services.\nCouncils have legal duty to house local people who become homeless. Typically, they put people up in hotels or hostels until more permanent arrangements can be made.\nSo, as homelessness has increased in recent years, so therefore has the financial burden on local authorities. \nThe umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is \"unsustainable\" and puts many councils at risk of becoming \"effectively bankrupt\", creating \"massive uncertainty\" to the future of local services.\nLondon Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by \u00a3330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.\nAccording to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.\nThis includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.\nThe human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.\nSpeaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a \"growing concern\" that people in temporary accommodation were \"internalising an issue that is a structural crisis\".\nLondon Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an \"emergency\" that was \"devastating the lives of too many Londoners\".\nThe organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions \u2013 like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change.\n\"We are providing \u00a31bn for crucial homelessness services so councils can support families faster. This is an increase of \u00a3233m from 2024 - 25, and London Boroughs have had a funding uplift by more than \u00a378m. \n\"We are also tackling its root causes by building 1.5 million new homes, boosting social and affordable housing and abolishing section 21 no fault evictions.\"\nThe private rental sector in London has shrunk, as landlords increasingly decide to sell their properties.\nAccording to analysis by Trust for London, 45,000 homes were lost from the sector in this way between April 2021-December 2023, equating to a net reduction of 4.3%.\nThe charity also said the sector was shrinking at a much faster rate the most affordable areas to rent in, which it believed had a \"particular impact\" on the ability of low-income households to access private rented homes.\nThe National Residential Landlords Association said \"uncertainty over proposed tax and regulatory changes is leading many landlords to consider leaving the market\". \nThe association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.\nLondon's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nPolling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.\nBoth the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.\nThe upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester. \nThe think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.\nThis comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is \"no time to waste\" and that it's \"crucial\" to \"get Britain building\".\nWhile targets are in place for new homes \u2013 delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London. \nCentre for London's polling revealed a third of Londoners have experienced damp and mould and over a quarter were unable to keep their homes warm.\nHousing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa uses social media to campaign on issues related to damp and mould and told Eddie Nestor on BBC Radio London, the situation is \"horrific\", adding \"there are times when I ask myself surely it cannot get worse than this?\".\nDuring the mayoral election campaign of 2024, Sir Sadiq pledged his support for a rollout of high-tech mould sensors, which City Hall said would provide an \"early warning system\". \nIndustry leaders have warned there is a 'dire shortage' of construction workers. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that there are over 35,000 job vacancies and employers report that over half of vacancies cannot be filled due to a lack of required skills \u2013 the highest rate of any sector.\nThe additional requirement of 160,000 construction workers applies specifically to meeting the need of Labour's housebuilding targets. Ahead of the government's pledge to build 1.5m new homes, the CITB had already estimated there would need to be a quarter of a million new construction workers to meet the country's housing demands.\nBefore the 2025 spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced \u00a3600m worth of investment to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers, and education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has committed to 'skills bootcamps' in the construction sector being expanded, with \u00a3100m to train, upskill and develop workers.\nSo what's the plan for London?\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Sir Sadiq Khan had made the capital's housing crisis a \"a key priority for his mayoralty\".\nIn 2018, City Hall established the Mayor's Construction Academy (MCA), a scheme aimed at helping Londoners gain the skills needed to enter the construction industry. \nThe mayor's office said it hoped the MCA would help address the need for more skilled construction workers in London.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

The think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.This comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone. The association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.London's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Polling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.London needs to build 88,000 homes a year, an annual cost of \u00a32.2bnBoth the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.The upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester. The umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is \"unsustainable\" and puts many councils at risk of becoming \"effectively bankrupt\", creating \"massive uncertainty\" to the future of local services.London Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by \u00a3330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.According to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.This includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.The human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.Speaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a \"growing concern\" that people in temporary accommodation were \"internalising an issue that is a structural crisis\".London Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an \"emergency\" that was \"devastating the lives of too many Londoners\".The organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions \u2013 like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.A government spokesperson said: \"We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change. \"Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is \"no time to waste\" and that it's \"crucial\" to \"get Britain building\".While targets are in place for new homes \u2013 delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London.",

        "article_text": "\"I was told I had a virus with no cure and between three and nine months to live.\"\nHIV activist Jonathan Blake believes he was one of, if not the first person to be diagnosed in Britain with human immunodeficiency virus, known as HIV, when he was aged 33. \n\"I was diagnosed in October 1982 at the Middlesex Hospital. It was incredibly winding.\"\nHe was diagnosed so early in the UK Aids epidemic that he was named Patient L1 at the hospital, and his story was featured in the 2014 film Pride.\nRecalling the early days of diagnosis, he told BBC London \"every single lymph node in my body had just erupted\". \nAfter undergoing tests in hospital, he was kept in a side ward for two days.\nJonathan, who is now 76, said he was told by doctors he would be given \"palliative care when the time comes\" - to which he thought: \"I'm 33, do I really want to hear about palliative care?\"\nHe added: \"I have been living with this virus and literally just trying to live every day. Never thinking that I will have a life, it's always been there.\"\nHIV is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.\nAids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is when a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses happen when the immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.\nWhile Aids cannot be transmitted from one person to another, the HIV virus can.\n\"It really wasn't until 2015, when they first announced 'U = U', 'Undetectable = Untransmittable', that I was no longer this kind of leper - that I had this poisoned blood, that I could infect anybody,\" Jonathan said.\nThe term means that if someone has an undetectable viral load, they cannot sexually transmit HIV to others.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust charity reports that by 1999, 33m people were living with HIV worldwide while the World Health Report listed Aids as the fourth biggest killer worldwide, 20 years after the epidemic began.\nAccording to the National Aids Trust, 2023 was the highest year for people receiving HIV care with 107,949 treated - an increase of 27% across the last 10 years.\nJonathan said: \"HIV is this forgotten epidemic. It is never talked about and it's so important it is. \n\"A lot of that is to do with stigma.\"\nHe added: \"I was on effective medication, because we have an amazing NHS. I am so fortunate that I have had access to the medication.\n\"The most important thing to do is know your status, be brave, get tested.\n\"The developments that are happening are extraordinary - even though there is no cure,\" he continued.\n\"I'm living proof.\"\nJonathan attended the launch on Wednesday of the report Getting to zero by 2030: HIV in London at the site of the future\u00a0HIV/Aids Memorial which is planned to be placed in Fitzrovia.\nIn 2018, the London mayor, London Councils, Public Health England and NHS England signed up to the Fast-Track Cities Declaration to reach zero new HIV infections, zero HIV-related stigma and zero HIV-related deaths by 2030.\nThe report, by the London Assembly Health Committee, found that despite progress in attitudes towards HIV, HIV-related stigma remained prevalent in London and the UK.\nLondon has historically had, and continues to have, higher rates of HIV than the rest of the country. \nHowever, the London Assembly said the city was leading the way globally to end new HIV cases and was seen as a leading international example through its HIV prevention and treatment programmes.\nThe Assembly added that \"concerted action\" would be required to increase testing, improve access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), ensure that everyone with HIV could access the care they needed and that services must reach people and communities who were currently missing out on them. \nRecommendations in the report included:\nChair of the\u00a0London Assembly Health Committee, Krupesh Hirani,\u00a0said London was \"a long way off\" reaching its 2030 target.\n\"After many years in which there was a year-on-year decline in new HIV cases, there has been an increase in cases in London and England since 2020. We would like to see the mayor take further action,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the mayor said Sadiq Khan would respond to the Assembly's report in due course.\nThey added: \"The current government has committed to commissioning a new HIV action plan and the mayor looks forward to working closely with ministers to help end HIV cases by 2030, as we build a fairer and healthier London for everyone.\" \nIn December 2023, the mayor announced \u00a3130,000 of funding from the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm towards the construction of a permanent HIV and Aids memorial in London. \nAids Memory UK, which is behind the project, said the memorial would be unveiled at the end of 2027 and the artwork would take the form of a felled tree.\nAmbassador of Aids Memorial UK, Mzz Kimberley, also known as Kim Tatum, said: \"The memorial is going to be a place where people can go and reflect, educate themselves, feel peace, talk to people.\n\"This memorial will mean that everyone who lost their life had meaning. \n\"It's a dedication to all the people around the world who've lost their life, or the injustices that society has brought to them.\"\nThe memorial means a lot to Jonathan, saying it would help \"create a community - I am so proud to be part of this HIV community.\n\"I've lost lots of friends - some very, very early but some more recently, and it still hurts.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York with jury selection on Monday. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on Monday.\nThe first days of the trial will consist of jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial will take place in front of US District Judge Arun Subramanian at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.\nThe trial is expected to be open to the public, but won't be streamed online.\nCameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.\n\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "Invented to satiate pregnancy cravings, Dubai chocolate is a rare combination of creativity, flavours and social media success that has broken all industry records.\nIt was a cold, damp evening in Munich in December 2024, but the festive tunes and the twinkling fairy lights at the Marienplatz Christkindlmarkt (Christmas market) lifted my spirits. With a mug of gl\u00fchwein (hot mulled wine) in hand, I made my way to the candy stall to get my usual supply of German Christmas cookies. But I stopped in my tracks when I realised that the longest queue was not for lebkuchen (gingerbread biscuits baked for Christmas) or the traditional stollen fruit bread, but for a new kid on the block: Dubai chocolate.\nThat was my first encounter with the viral chocolate in a land far from its birthplace. But by then, Dubai chocolate had already become a global sensation: a rich, sticky and unapologetically extra chocolate bar that had shattered industry records, won millions of hearts and was spreading like wildfire across the world.\nA decadent milk chocolate bar filled with silky pistachio cream, earthy tahini and crunchy shards of knafeh pastry, the original Dubai chocolate was launched by Dubai-based FIX Dessert Chocolatier in 2022 when its British Egyptian founder, Sarah Hamouda, had an urge to create something unique to satisfy her pregnancy cravings for knafeh and pistachio. FIX called their creation \"Can't Get Knafeh Of It\".\nCan't Get Knafeh Of It took the world by storm when TikTok influencer Maria Vehera posted a rapturous video of herself trying the chocolate bar inside her car in December 2023. The video quickly went viral, attracting more than 125 million views and scores of fans around the world who were willing to do anything to grab a bite. The bar became a craze and was promptly christened \"Dubai chocolate\".\nIn an interview with the BBC earlier this year, Yezen Alani, co-founder of FIX, described the international spotlight as \"flattering and humbling\". However, despite FIX's plans for global expansion, its Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar remains solely available in the UAE, pushing independent chocolatiers and multinational brands such as Lindt and \u00dclker to mimic the original and produce their own versions to meet global demand. These imitations, also known as \"Dubai chocolate\", have inundated supermarkets and neighbourhood bodegas all over the world.\nToday, Dubai chocolate can be found everywhere, from the online shelves of UAE's food delivery apps and the brimming counters of Istanbul's sweet shops to the packed aisles of London's Lidl stores and the chaotic alleyways of Mumbai's flea markets. Global demand continues to skyrocket, resulting in worldwide stockouts and an international pistachio shortage. It has spawned waitlists at chocolate counters across Europe and the United States and inspired limited-edition collaborations with major brands like Shake Shack and Starbucks. Supermarkets have begun rationing Dubai chocolate, and people have been caught smuggling the prized bars. In short, the Dubai chocolate craze has shaken the global chocolate industry.\nThis has opened up a whole new market for artisan confectioners worldwide, including the renowned Maison Samadi in London. Maison Samadi, one of the UK's oldest chocolatiers with roots in Lebanon, was the first to introduce their version of the viral Dubai chocolate bars, named \"Dubai Viral Style Chocolate\" in London. For Nabil Chehab, business development director at Maison Samadi, making Dubai Viral Style Chocolate was a natural segue in their chocolate-making journey. \"We were already working on our heritage collection when we discovered the viral Dubai chocolate. It fitted perfectly because it combined a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, the knafeh, which was a tribute to the Samadi family heritage, with chocolate, our core expertise,\" says Chehab.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nChehab tells me that the demand for their Dubai Viral Style Chocolate bars has far exceeded their expectations, likely due to the interesting concept behind it. \"It's remarkable how the FIX team came up with this innovative idea of having a 'dessert in a chocolate bar' that has now become more enjoyable and satisfying than just a regular chocolate bar,\" enthuses Chehab. For centuries, food lovers have relished knafeh on its own. Now, Dubai chocolate allows them to sample this well-known dessert inside a chocolate shell, making the experience even more intriguing and exciting.\u00a0\n\"The real success of Dubai chocolate stems from its texture,\" agrees leading Turkish food writer Aylin \u00d6ney Tan. \"The velvety gooeyness of the pistachio cream doesn't just feel good on your palate; it is also visually attractive. Additionally, the crunchy texture of the kadayif pastry from the knafeh makes the dessert even more irresistible.\"\n\"Chocolates with a palpable crunch, such as Swiss Toblerone and Ferrero Rocher, have always done well in the market,\" explains \u00d6ney Tan. \"Same with Dubai chocolate. Only in this case, the crunch goes an extra mile and primes the chocolate bar for social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\" As Vehera bites into the paint-splattered chocolate bar in her TikTok video, decadent pistachio cream oozes out and crunchy ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) sounds fill the foreground, making it a clear social media winner.\nHowever, \"although Dubai chocolate's instant growth has been fuelled largely by social media, the exclusivity of the original bar has kept the interest going,\" says Monique Naval, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. The original Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar is only available online at 14:00 and 17:00 through online food delivery app Deliveroo in the UAE. FIX produces around 500 bars every day, and they sell out fast. The limited availability, both temporal and geographical, creates a fear of missing out, further increasing interest and demand.\n\"Having Dubai in the name also adds to the chocolate's popularity and hype,\" says Naval. When people think of Dubai, they think of lavish hotels, glitzy malls, luxurious cars and gold-dusted desserts. Similar \"feelings of indulgence drive the success of Dubai chocolate,\" she adds.\nBeyond its viral fame, Dubai chocolate's resonance also lies in its deep Middle Eastern roots \u2013 tapping into family traditions of sharing sweets, gifting edible treats and the nostalgic flavours of knafeh and pistachios woven into daily life across the region.\nFor Chehab, the connection runs deep.\n\"When my wife's great-grandfather, Muhieddine Samadi, started Al Samadi Sweets in Beirut in 1872, knafeh was one of the first sweets he ever sold,\" he reminisces. \"I grew up in Beirut. As a kid, I remember taking the famous Lebanese shared taxi to Al Samadi Sweets daily, picking up a plate of knafeh for breakfast and eating it on my way to my father's shop. Little did I know [at that time] that I would be marrying Samadi's lovely great-granddaughter,\" he adds, with a twinkle in his eyes.\nIn an interview with Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said, \"I wanted the FIX experience to be different. I wanted people, from that first bite, to relive moments of their past.\" And for many fans around the world, that first bite delivers exactly what Hamouda intended: an edible journey back to bustling Middle Eastern souks, where merchants sell delicious local sweets and the air is dense with the aroma of pistachios.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0The baffling purple honey found only in North Carolina\n \u2022 The world's true cradle of chocolate\n \u2022\u00a0A beauty mogul's guide to luxury self-care in Dubai\n\"Sixty-eight percent of the world's consumers want to experience cultures other than their own and that includes a willingness and desire to try new flavours and ingredients,\" explains Naval. Pistachios \u2013 a Middle Eastern staple \u2013 are riding this wave too, billed as the next big seasonal flavour globally, and appearing in everything from lattes to liqueurs.\nAt the same time, Middle Eastern tourism is booming and Dubai has emerged as a culinary destination in its own right, with some visitors flying in just to taste the viral chocolate firsthand. What began as a simple chocolate bar in a Dubai dessert shop has evolved into a global sensation.\n\"I am not surprised,\" says Chehab, reflecting on the chocolate's meteoric rise. \"It is the perfect amalgamation of taste, texture, indulgence and nostalgia. It was born to be a champion.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

But by then, Dubai chocolate had already become a global sensation: a rich, sticky and unapologetically extra chocolate bar that had shattered industry records, won millions of hearts and was spreading like wildfire across the world.A decadent milk chocolate bar filled with silky pistachio cream, earthy tahini and crunchy shards of knafeh pastry, the original Dubai chocolate was launched by Dubai-based FIX Dessert Chocolatier in 2022 when its British Egyptian founder, Sarah Hamouda, had an urge to create something unique to satisfy her pregnancy cravings for knafeh and pistachio. It fitted perfectly because it combined a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, the knafeh, which was a tribute to the Samadi family heritage, with chocolate, our core expertise,\" says Chehab.World's TableBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.Chehab tells me that the demand for their Dubai Viral Style Chocolate bars has far exceeded their expectations, likely due to the interesting concept behind it. Similar \"feelings of indulgence drive the success of Dubai chocolate,\" she adds.Beyond its viral fame, Dubai chocolate's resonance also lies in its deep Middle Eastern roots \u2013 tapping into family traditions of sharing sweets, gifting edible treats and the nostalgic flavours of knafeh and pistachios woven into daily life across the region.For Chehab, the connection runs deep.",

        "article_text": "Tom Cleverley played for Watford from 2017 to 2023 before moving into coaching\nWatford have sacked head coach Tom Cleverley after the team failed to reach the Championship play-offs.\nThe Hornets finished 14th in the table after taking only one point from their last five games - a 1-1 season-ending draw with Sheffield Wednesday.\nFormer Manchester United, Everton and Watford midfielder Cleverley, capped 13 times by England, was appointed as interim boss in March 2024 following Valerien Ismael's departure.\nHe was then confirmed in the post on a permanent basis the following month.\nThe 35-year-old was in charge for 60 games in total, winning 20 and losing 26.\nSporting director Gian Luca Nani said: \"The time has come for a change and to build on what we believe is a young and talented squad that will have benefited from the experience of the Championship this season.\n\"It has been a privilege to work closely with Tom; to understand how he sees the game and his enthusiasm for everything here. He deserves to be recognised for this and I'm sure he will have a bright future in the game.\"\nThe Hornets are now looking for their 10th permanent head coach since Nigel Pearson was sacked in the summer of 2020 with the club facing relegation from the Premier League.\nCleverley was the first head coach to remain in charge for an entire season since Javi Gracia in 2018-19.\nHe was unbeaten at home in his first 15 league games as boss, but results took a downturn following a 2-1 defeat by Cardiff on 29 December and they only took five points from the next nine matches.\nReports in Spain earlier this season claimed former Villarreal head coach Jose Rojo Martin, known as Pacheta, had been in talks with Watford to replace him.\nIn January, the club dismissed that as \"pure speculation\" and owner Gino Pozzo later said of Cleverley: \"We are committed to support him and look forward to the challenges ahead together.\"\nSpeaking last week, Cleverley said that hopes of achieving a play-off place had been undermined by injuries, particularly among his forwards.\n\"There's no difference in the number of goals we've conceded from pre-January to post-January, but the amount of goals we've scored has dropped significantly,\" he said.\nHe promised to learn the lessons of the campaign and added: \"We spent 10 weeks in the play-offs [places], we showed real positive signs before the turn of the year and I think we can clearly identify where and why we've run out of a bit of steam.\n\"We've got an incredibly young squad, the average age is boosted up by one or two individuals, but apart from that it's largely under 25 and the majority under 21 at the minute.\n\"The experiences they will have had this year - some bad ones - to really develop and ultimately improve from is one of the really exciting positives from this season.\"\nNo Watford manager or head coach has lasted an entire calendar year in the job since Malky Mackay in 2010.\nSince being relegated from the Premier League in 2022, they have finished 11th, 15th and now 14th.\n\"There will be no further club comment until a new appointment has been made,\" a statement on the Hornets website said.\nTom Cleverley made 146 appearances for Watford as a player\nBy Geoff Doyle, BBC Three Counties Radio sport editor\nThis is going to go down very badly with Watford fans.

        "article_text": "Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for India's security forces and diplomats.\nThis is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nAnd before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.\nEach time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.\nSince 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.\nOnce again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.\n\"There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,\" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.\nYet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \"This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,\" he explains.\n\"We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nA week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.\nDelhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)\n\nIn his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019. \nHe was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.\nMr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.\nThey included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.\n\"How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,\" Mr Bisaria writes.\n\"All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.\"\nThe strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive. \nA day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing. \nIndia's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's \"autonomous terror list\".\nWhile there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution. \nAt the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a \"false-flag operation\".\nMuch like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 \"overground workers\" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.\nIn a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that \"that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited\".\n\"She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,\" Mr Bisaria writes. \nOn 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.\nSix hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed \"a very large number\" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.\nThe crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.\nIn the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.\nMr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was \"any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.\"\nPakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a \"goodwill gesture\" aimed at de-escalating tensions.\nBy 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.\n\"I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,\" Mr Bisaria writes,\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.\"\nMr Bisaria described it as a \"testing and fascinating time\" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred \"ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved\".\nHe views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a \"de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct\". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.\n\"The body language and optics are similar [this time],\" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. \"If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.\"\n\"Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action.\"",

Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.\nTrump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.\nThe administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content. \n\"The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,\" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \"It's still a big tariff.\"\nExecutives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs. \nGeneral Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.\nMercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.\nArt Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing. \n\"If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,\" he said.\nThe administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.\nTrump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.\n\"Everything is pretty good now,\" he said. \"I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.\"",

        "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.\nHe believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.\nSir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"\nThe ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.\nA blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.\nA host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.\nToby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.\nThe film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.\nSir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"\nSince then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.\nOcean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.\nThe new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.\n\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.\nThe process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.  \nSir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".\nSir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.\nIt is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.\nJust one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"\nBut in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.\nOne of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"\nDespite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"\nSir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.\nHe believes that could be transformational. \n\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"\nA healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.\n\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.\nAs he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.\nOcean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate.\nAntonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie.\nIt was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year.\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAntonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend.\nBut at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying.\n\"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it.\n\"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\"\nAntonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly.\n\"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added.\n\"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\"\nStarting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1.\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nAntonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth.\nPiastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole.\nNorris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there.\n\"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\"\nAntonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap.\nThe idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second.\nBut it worked for neither. Russell did not improve on his second lap, and while Verstappen did, he was 0.255secs slower than Antonelli and 0.21secs off Piastri.\nVerstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: \"What we did in Q3 was good, the tyres are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time.\"\nHis lack of pace came despite a new floor this weekend as the team seek improved performance.\nVerstappen added: \"In the first sector we were quite competitive because that's where a few high-speed corners are but as soon as you get to the low speed we lack quite a bit of grip. P4 is all right, you have to be realistic with the limitations we have at the moment and it was still quite close.\"\nRussell said: \"Massive congrats to Kimi. He did an amazing job. He has been really quick all day, really impressive.\n\"I have been struggling a little bit, not that comfortable, and we wanted to go early because I didn't have that confidence. P5 is not great but amazing (result) for Kimi and the team.\"\nHamilton, who won the first sprint of the season in China from pole position, was seventh fastest, one place behind team-mate Charles Leclerc. It was an improvement for Hamilton after a dire past three races, but he was still 0.222secs off his team-mate.\nNeither Ferrari driver was happy. \"It was a better session,\" Hamilton said, \"but we are just lacking speed.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'You can't feel sympathy' - Besiktas' Solskjaer discusses Man Utd woes\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer bounces in as light and airy as the summer room Besiktas have allocated for our interview.\n\"I came here to get away from people like you,\" he laughs, explaining the joke to club officials through his Turkish interpreter.\nHis mood is relaxed and jovial.\nOver the next 30 minutes, Solskjaer, who is 2,000 miles from his spiritual home in Manchester and 1,700 from his actual home in Norway, reflects on the lack of contact with former United colleagues, reveals his shock at the sale of Scott McTominay and worry over what's happening to his \"family\" at Old Trafford.\nBut this is not his priority right now. He must concentrate on a massive and highly pressurised managerial role and his first experience of an Istanbul derby away from home, when Besiktas face Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce on Sunday.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has won seven of his 14 games in charge of Besiktas\nIt is an important game. Besiktas need a result to maintain hopes of a third-place finish which, depending on who wins the Turkish Cup final, offers a Europa League play-off spot rather than a place in the second qualifying round.\n\"That's the deal I have made,\" Solskjaer says. \"It is more important than an extra few quid. If we get third, the players get an extra week off in the summer.\"\nFenerbahce are chasing the third - and currently dominant - Istanbul team, Galatasaray, for the title. Heading into the weekend, they are five points behind, with five games left. They cannot afford to slip up. Who knows what Mourinho has in store to turn the situation his way.\nIt is against this backdrop that Solskjaer has agreed to speak at length to BBC Sport for the first time since he lost his job at Manchester United in October 2021. Like Mourinho before him, the Norwegian paid the price for regression the season after he finished second.\nBesiktas are very much his club now. But events at Old Trafford are never far from his mind.\n\"Man United is my family and will always be part of me,\" he says.\n\"In football, you don't feel sorry for anyone because we are privileged, absolutely 100% privileged to be able to work in clubs like this.\n\"But for me, it is hard to watch because it is your family that is struggling. It is never easy at the weekend when you look at the table.\"\nHe is talking with incredulity about the fact United, at the time of this meeting, are 14th in the Premier League.\nThey were seventh when he was dismissed after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Two months before that they had been third, behind leaders Chelsea on goal difference.\nBut a terrible run of results, including a record 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool and 2-0 loss to Manchester City at Old Trafford where the scoreline massively flattered United, meant Solskjaer knew what was coming as the Watford debacle unfolded.\nIt has taken him a long time to return. Why Besiktas?\n\"You have not been here long enough,\" he says with a smile.\n\"The club is fantastic. I spoke to a lot without doing anything about it. This was the only one I spoke to where I looked back afterwards and thought 'I wish I was there' because there is so much potential.\n\"You feel the identity and culture in the club is aligned with you; the values about honesty, community work. We were the first club in Turkey to go abroad to play. It is very similar to Man United in that sense. It just reminded me of Man United when I was there.\"\nThe pay-off is telling.\nSolskjaer signed Maguire and made him captain at United\nAt United, Solskjaer had tried to instil the 'look after everyone' mentality he knew so well from Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\nHe took that approach from the first day he returned to United's Carrington training ground after taking an SOS call from then executive chairman Ed Woodward in December 2018.\nWoodward wanted Solskjaer to bring a smile back to the face of a club that had turned toxic as Mourinho's tenure drew to a close amid rancour and recrimination.\nThe new boss handed out chocolate bars to staff members \u2013 something he used to do in his own playing days. Beloved receptionist Kath Phipps was the first recipient. Solskjaer flew in for Phipps' funeral in January 2025. He went on to the wake, which was populated by so many of the old guard.\nSolskjaer noted that day, as did so many others, there seemed to be a disconnect between United's current leadership and the past.\nWe meet a day after United have beaten Atletico Bilbao to plant one foot into the Europa League final. His elation for players he knows well comes with a shocking revelation given his knowledge of the club and the advice he could offer, plus the elevated position he holds from his playing days, which goes far beyond a single \u2013 iconic \u2013 goal at the Nou Camp.\n\"For me, Harry [Maguire] has always been a leader and a fighter,\" Solskjaer says.\n\"I was never in doubt when I signed him and he walked in the door he would be captain for us.\n\"There is another captain there in Bruno [Fernandes]. The two of them are top human beings. I was so happy for them last night.\n\"Those two and Victor [Lindelof] are probably the only ones still at the club that I have heard from since I left. You want the best for them.\"\nHe doesn't say it \u2013 and wouldn't because by his nature he is not one to take cheap shots and he will never alter the fundamentals he took from his parents and has tried to pass on as a husband and father \u2013 but the lack of communication hurts.\nAn example of his values is shown a few minutes later when he is walking across from the Besiktas training ground from the summer house to the main building to get his lunch.\nTwo young supporters spot him and ask for autographs and selfies. Not only does he oblige, he stops 19-year-old Ecuador winger Keny Arroyo, a \u00a36.4m February arrival, who is about to walk past, to make sure he does the same.\nScott McTominay has helped Napoli lead Serie A with a flurry of goals since his move from Manchester United \nThere is a strong Manchester United undercurrent to the next game for Solskjaer.\nWorking with him at Besiktas is former United goalkeeping coach Richard Hartis and Tom Green, who left his job at United's senior performance analyst in February to take on the head of analysis role at the Turkish club.\nPlaying for Mourinho is former United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat and also a player Solskjaer knows very well in Fred, the Brazilian half of United's one-time 'McFred' midfield axis, alongside Scott McTominay.\nTalking about this offers an opportunity to despair at the recruitment and sales decisions his old club have taken, including allowing McTominay to join Napoli.\n\"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%,\" Solskjaer says.\n\"How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"\nMourinho and Solskjaer last met in 2021 when the Portuguese was manager of Tottenham\nSolskjaer assesses the work ahead of him in a pragmatic way. From a detached perspective, it seems many of the challenges he is facing are similar to those Ruben Amorim is experiencing at United.\nTo that end, a Europa League win could be crucial in buying Amorim time. It is something United came within a missed David de Gea penalty of achieving when Solskjaer's team were beaten by Unai Emery's Villarreal in the 2021 final.\n\"Everyone knows you need time to shape a team into what you want it to look like,\" said Solskjaer.\n\"But you have to manage it the best you can, not as you wish it was. There are things I want my team to do that this one can't. We have come into a difficult financial period because in the past the club has spent money, maybe not so wisely.\"\nI point out that is an observation I have heard about another club close to his heart. Solskjaer is about to answer but checks himself.\n\"Yes. But that's, you know when you\u2026\u2026.actually, I don't have to say that,\" he said.\n\"Look, recruitment is probably the most important thing in football.\n\"You need the structures right and you need to get the right people in.\n\"When you manage two, three, four or five different managers' players, it is hard to make it balance into a team you want to see. Everyone knows you need continuity and patience to get success, but not too many get it.\"\nSolskjaer has not spoken to Mourinho since his arrival in Turkey and says he is looking forward to meeting him again.\nI remind him of their spat in April 2021 \u2013 a week before Mourinho was sacked by Tottenham \u2013 when the Portuguese reacted badly to Solskjaer claiming Son Heung-min had cheated to ensure a United goal was disallowed.\n\"I would not feed my son if he behaved like that,\" chided the Norwegian at the time. Mourinho's response was classic: \"Sonny is very lucky his father is a better person than Ole. As a father, you always have to feed your kids, even if you have to steal.\"\n\"I remember that one,\" shrugs Solskjaer. \"You look after your own team.\n\"He has all the charisma of course and I don't think any of us change a lot when we have come this far.\n\"It will be good to see him again and hopefully the headlines will be about the team and the football that is played and nothing else.\"\nBesiktas beat Galatasaray on 29 March but have won just once in four games since.\nSolskjaer knows the atmosphere at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium will be white hot.\n\"I saw from Gala, when you are at home and winning these games there is nothing better,\" he says.\n\"If you are at home and you don't win, there is nothing worse.\n\"Football is decided by moments. You see last night [Thursday], Athletic had two or three massive chances and Victor saves one on the goal line. Then it all changes.\n\"The margins between winning and losing in football are so close. It is better to be lucky than good sometimes.\n\"Hopefully, it will be one of Jose's bad nights.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers has resorted to using pen and paper for orders as the disruption from the cyber attack on the retailer continues.\nThe boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it has also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there is more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend. \nM&S has been unable to offer online orders for clothing and homewares for over a week, and some stores have seen empty shelves as food deliveries have also been disrupted.\nTwo M&S workers told the BBC they were concerned about pay because they were unable to clock in and out of work and could not access staff apps.\nIn a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: \"In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.\"\nThat means back to \"pen and paper\", he said.\nGreencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas.\n\"They're a massive customer for us and we're trying to flood them with products to help them,\" said Mr Philips.\n\"There are times when you do need to revert to manual systems in any business... but look, it works well.\n\"With the challenges of the system we don't have intricate forecasting that we would have previously had, so we're just making sure that they've got everything they need and some more.\"\nGeorge, not his real name, works at an M&S in Wales, and said it has been \"a nightmare\".\n\"We have been told pay will be given through a separate payment system. However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.\n\"Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).\"\nOne former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.\n\"There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,\" they told the BBC.\nM&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.\nAs a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.\n\"They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.\n\"I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.\"\nGreencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.\nM&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.\nOne food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.\n\"The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.\"\nBut he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.\nGed Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.\n\"If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.\"\nBut the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.\nThe company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.\nThe chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was \"imperative\" to understand what had happened.\nOne person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.\n\"Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.\"\nM&S has been contacted for comment. \nAdditional reporting by Kris Bramwell ",

But can shaking one's hips really avoid creaking hips? \nWell, according to Ms Hobin, her particular form of activity - a dance originating in ancient Egypt - has helped many of her students with physical health problems, including strengthening the upper back as well as boosting flexibility.\n\"It's changed my life,\" she said. \"It's fantastic, it raises your energy levels and people can't believe my age, I've stayed slim since my 30s.\"\nShe said the dance emerged after women in labour were encouraged to concentrate on their pelvic and abdominal regions to avoid the pain of contractions.\n\"Women tend to fight against contraction, but through the movements [they went with it], it's just nature,\" she said.\nBut such undulations - when presented on stage - once confused Britain which, she explained, could not easily disassociate the art from sex. \nMs Hobin said there was a lack of understanding about belly dancing, particularly regarding sexualisation, whether that be through deliberate presentation or flawed perception, both of which she was against. \n\"I was doing a lot of TV,\" she said of her past, \"and producers told me there hadn't been a belly dancer who had gone far [on screen]. That really, really annoyed me - they assumed [I was like] a stripper or prostitute.\n\"In this country, [the dance was mostly performed] in nightclubs [or by] strippers.\n\"I don't encourage people to come showing their bellies and boobs. I like to encourage women from all walks of life, all shapes and ages \u2013 there's not a particular image you have to emulate.\"\nIt's all meant that she somewhat struggles with the term belly dancing, although admits it's the one by which people most easily recognise the form.\nShe said she preferred to call it \"the sacred dance of life\", or at least \"belly dancing for health and fitness\".\nMs Hobin said she had seen women's confidence and self-esteem blossom after taking up the dance.\n\"I've seen women who have been divorced and their husbands left them for someone else,\" she said.\n\"They didn't think they were good enough anymore, but they do dancing and it's helped them get in touch with themselves.\n\"[I've also seen] people who have been abused and said it helped them get in touch with their body and sexuality again.\"\nMs Hobin said she was introduced to belly dancing in the 1970s. \nAfter seeing a newspaper article about a class, she thought the dancer looked \"elegant and lovely\" and decided to become a member. She said she had never looked back.\n\nShe has been teaching her own classes since 1974 - with students including inmates at a women's prison - and has been invited all over the world to host belly dancing workshops.\nAnd there are no plans to stop.\n\"I'll dance until I'm 120,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Manchester United only needed a point against Manchester City to qualify for Europe\nMelvine Malard celebrated her equaliser like it was a stoppage-time winner and the Old Trafford crowd gave an outpouring of adulation. It reflected the significance of this result for Manchester United.\nNot only did they come from 2-0 down - and with 10 players after Aoife Mannion was sent off - to secure a point against bitter rivals Manchester City, it confirmed Champions League football for next season.\nFour points clear with one game left, United ended City's own hopes of playing in Europe.\nMarc Skinner's side can now prepare for a new future, looking at unique recruitment strategies and eyeing up financial gains, while City will assess where it all went wrong. \nSimply put, the 2-2 draw on Sunday was really a victory for United. \n\"To go 2-0 down, then come back, then go down to 10 players and then to see the game out... it absolutely feels like a win,\" said manager Skinner. \n\"It obviously secured Champions League football so it is a huge moment for this young team. They haven't faced many moments like that. To do it, is very special.\"\nMan Utd comeback against Man City seals Europe spot\nMan City 'fall short of standards' to miss out on Europe\nWhat's gone wrong for Man City in trophyless season?\nManchester United will compete in a third successive FA Cup final this month\nUnited have been in this position before in 2023, when they secured a Champions League spot, but failed to progress from the qualifying rounds a few months later.\nWomen's Super League champions Chelsea will go straight into the group phase of the competition next season, while second and third place go into the qualification rounds, meaning United will still have to navigate that.\nBut they want to go one step further and will attempt to attract the biggest names in Europe to compete in the competition. \nFinancially, there are rewards. Reaching the group stages of the Women's Champions League means they would receive just over \u00a3430,000 as a starting fee and bonus payments on top, depending on results.\n\"It's huge. The next step is that we have to recruit the right way,\" added Skinner.\n\"In order to go into the depths of the Champions League - and from our perspective actually qualify for the group stages - we have to add the quality of depth. \n\"Champions League gives you that. People want to come to a Champions League team. Hopefully it opens that market for us.\"\nEuropean football also gives United an elevated status in the women's game. \nThey no longer need to rely on the brand of Manchester United as a club - but the success of their performances as a team.\nIt is also a boost in their efforts to convince United co-owner, Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his staff that the women's team are worth investing in. \nSkinner added: \"The club has a big status but the women's team has a young status. We qualified [for Europe] two seasons ago but now we have done it again and that does give us a big status.\n\"When we have recruitment calls, it's always about whether we get to the Champions League - that is what the agents are saying. \n\"That status opens up more doors to give us better conversations.\"\nWhile United are planning for bigger things, they must prepare well for the crucial transfer window Skinner has constantly referred to.\nWhen they last got into Europe, United signed World Cup Golden Boot winner Hinata Miyazawa, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Brazilian winger Geyse.\nBut American Tullis-Joyce did not break into the first team until this season, alongside Miyazawa consistently, while Geyse is now on loan at Gotham FC. \nThey needed more physicality and experience, said Skinner, but the challenge this time around is to recruit players who can make an instant difference.\n\"I have not stopped all year to be honest in terms of our recruitment. We haven't just waited,\" said Skinner.\n\"We have that moment now to reflect - but it will be a big summer for us, for sure.\"\nHow will United make sure it's a successful window?\nThe club are developing their own analysis system which looks at data and statistics to help them talent spot the players who are right for them. \nTechnical director Jason Wilcox and women's head of recruitment Harvey Bussell are working together to lead the task.\n\"It's becoming much more robust. It's still in its infancy, but that's, I think, the strategy route we will go down,\" added Skinner.\n\"We've spoken as a team, we get Champions League, then we have to look at the budget and how we progress in the market. \n\"We're in a competitive market. So I've got to try to find, with my expertise, how I can make a player better.\n \"Those are the little details that we'll have to work through.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

A search for screengrabs from the video on Google found the footage actually showed Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip on 13 October 2023.\nWhile much of the debunked footage has purported to show the immediate aftermath of the Indian strikes, some clips analysed by BBC Verify appeared to be trying to portray the Pakistani response as being more severe than it actually was.\nOne video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the \"Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters\". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month.\nElsewhere, one set of photos purported to show an operation carried out by the Pakistan Air Force targeting \"Indian forward air-bases in the early hours of 6 May 2025\". The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3.\nThe Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views. \nBut two widely shared images actually showed previous Indian air force jet crashes - one from an incident in Rajasthan in 2024 and another in the Punjab state in 2021. Both crashes were widely reported.\nProf Indrajit Roy of York University said that the images \"are being generated with a view to get support for the military in Pakistan\". One clip circulated by the Pakistani military itself was later withdrawn by news agencies after it turned out to be from an unrelated event. \n\"We have jingoists on both sides of the border, and they have a huge platform on Twitter (X). You can see how fake news, as well as some real news, gets amplified, distorted and presented in ways designed to generate hostility, animosity and hatred for the other side.\"\nThe conflict in Kashmir has long attracted a high degree of misinformation online. In the aftermath of the deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, AI images circulated - with some seeking to dramatise actual scenes from the attack.\nVedika Bahl, a journalist with France 24, said the Pahalgam attacks had prompted a sharp \"uptake in misinformation from both sides surrounding the conflict\".\n\"Lots of this misinformation begins on X,\" she said. \"Eventually this trickles down over time from X to WhatsApp which is the communication tool which is most used in South Asian communities.\"\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma made two superb saves to keep out Arsenal last week - this stop from Gabriel Martinelli, and another to deny Leandro Trossard\nA calamity keeper or the human wall? Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday.\nWill they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win?\nOr could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt?\nArsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign.\nHis supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.\nStill, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020.\nThis video can not be played\nItaly win in penalty shootout against England to become European champions\nHe has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too.\nIn any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness.\nSo, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist?\nBBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer.\nGianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically.\nThat clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else.\n\"He's massive, but his positional awareness in his box is excellent,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"That's down to the depth perception he has when he is reading a through ball and his understanding of where his line is.\n\"A lot of goalkeepers get sucked into rushing off their line to try to close down the angle and to close down the shot, and they think they are in a better position further away from the goal. It is something I did myself sometimes, and you find the shot is past you before you are ready.\n\"What Donnarumma does instead, very cleverly, is stay closer to his line, maybe two or three yards away. Because of his size he knows he can cover most of his goal from there anyway.\n\"The save he made low down with his left hand from Trossard's shot last week was the perfect example of that, and of him knowing exactly where he is in relation to his line.\n\"As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. Instead, he holds his position, and makes the save on the angle.\n\"It is a brilliant save and it is his physique that allows him to make it, but also down to his technique and his positional awareness, which is second to none.\"\nWhile his form has fluctuated, Donnarumma's contract situation is the main reason why his future is uncertain.\nHe has one year left on the five-year deal he signed when he joined PSG, and has reportedly been in talks about an extension.\nAccording to his agent, Enzo Raiola, Donnarumma wants to stay - but he has been also been linked to a summer return to Serie A, and Milan, with Inter, while it appears PSG may have alternatives in mind too.\n\"The club are taking their time to decide what to do,\" explained French football journalist Laurens.\n\"They like Lucas Chevalier at Lille a lot and Luis Campos (PSG's football advisor in charge of recruitment) knows Chevalier well from when he was there.\"\nChevalier was reported to be one of Manchester United's targets before they signed Andre Onana as David de Gea's replacement. He helped Lille beat Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the group stage of this season's Champions League before the French side lost to Borussia Dortmund in the last 16\nChevalier, 23, is known for his passing proficiency as well as his saving ability and is seen as the future of French goalkeeping. He broke into the senior squad for the first time at the end of 2024, although he is yet to make his senior debut for Les Bleus.\n\"PSG have not made their minds up,\" added Laurens. \"Can they really get an upgrade on Donnarumma and, if so, is Chevalier that player?\n\"Any money they get for Donnarumma \u2013 maybe \u00a325-30m - would be pure profit, but then it would probably cost around \u00a350m to get Chevalier, so what do they do?\n\"The problem they have with Donnarumma is not on his line, where he is great - everyone at the club recognises that. It is just I think (PSG boss) Luis Enrique would rather have a good goalkeeper who is better with the ball at his feet.\n\"Still, it is a difficult decision. Of course it is ideal if you can get everything you need in a goalkeeper, but I am not sure Chevalier has everything yet.\"\nPSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. He went on to score a 17-minute hat-trick to send Real into the quarter-finals\nIt is Donnarumma's mistakes that have led some PSG fans to lose patience with him, and seen him targeted by the French media, with one performance in particular proving hard to forget.\n\"He got some criticism recently for Harvey Elliott's goal against Liverpool, which was bad, then he made a mistake when they lost to Nice too, when their first goal went under his arm,\" Laurens said.\n\"For a long time, though, he has been seen as just not being good enough at crosses or set-pieces.\nKai Havertz put Arsenal ahead in their group-stage win over PSG in October, capitalising when Donnarumma failed to deal with a Leandro Trossard cross\n\"He has tried to work on that, just like he has tried to improve with the ball at his feet, but I don't see much of an improvement with any of his weaknesses.\n\"I think also he still carries with him his worst moment, the Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022.\n\"PSG were 1-0 up at the Bernabeu with 30 minutes to go after winning the first leg 1-0 too, but then Karim Benzema kind of barged into Donnarumma, got the ball off him and scored - and then Benzema scored two more goals quickly and PSG were out.\n\"A lot of fans remember that moment, and they feel that there is another mistake coming somewhere, but every time we see him doing well, that surely gets him more points to stay and have his contract extended than the other way around.\"\nDonnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world.\nThe CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded.\nIt places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20.\nDonnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. He has played 151 games all competitions for the French side, and has won Ligue 1 four times\nRobinson used a different criteria, including his eyes, to come up with an alternative top three where Alisson does appear, along with Donnarumma.\n\"For me, Alisson is the best in the world, because he hasn't forgotten the fundamentals of goalkeeping, which are to keep the ball out of the net,\" Robinson explained.\n\"Commanding your box, communicating with your back four, stopping shots and dealing with one on ones are all part of that, but he can adapt to the modern way of playing out from the back too, without taking it to the next level like Ederson does.\n\"Ederson is the best with his feet but for the all-round package there is Alisson, Jan Oblak at Atletico Madrid and Donnarumma, and you can put those three in the same bracket.\n\"To be the very best you need the right mindset too, and Donnarumma has that. He has played so many games since his debut for AC Milan aged 16 that he is much more experienced than most keepers his age.\n\"That maturity means he is comfortable on the biggest stage, and can make a difference the way he has done so many times already.\n\"There is this uncertainty about where he will be next year but I bet PSG are glad they have got him at the moment - if they go on to win the Champions League this season, he will play a huge part in that.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday.Will they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win?Or could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt?Arsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign.His supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.Still, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Italy win in penalty shootout against England to become European championsHe has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too.In any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness.So, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist?BBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer. \"'He still carries with him his worst moment'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, PSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. \"How does he compare to the world's best?Donnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world.The CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded.It places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Donnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. \"As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. 'His positional awareness is second to none'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions LeagueAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically.That clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else.",

        "article_text": "A second-hand Zelda cartridge. A cryptic forum thread. A generation of frightened children. This is the story of Ben Drowned \u2013 the internet's most infamous video game ghost.\nIt was Christmas Eve and 10-year-old Saarthak Johri couldn't sleep \u2013 but not because of excitement. He was shot through with fear. It was roughly a decade ago and Johri was a kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, in the US. He had spent the day slumped in an easy chair, staring at his phone, totally absorbed in an online urban myth. Johri knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. And yet, he was powerless to get it out of his mind.\nHe had found a trail of old forum posts supposedly written by a college student. The student, who used the online pseudonym Jadusable, had bought a strange copy of a Nintendo 64 video game at a yard sale. It was The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a notoriously dark instalment in the Zelda franchise, released 25 years ago this week on 27 April 2000.\nMajora's Mask is full of unnerving discussions about death, denial, fear, regret \u2013 and a looming apocalypse. But something was off about the cartridge Jadusable found. It had no label, just \"Majora\" scribbled on the plastic in marker. And something was seriously wrong with it.\nJadusable wrote that the game's familiar graphics were strange and distorted. Music played backwards in a spine-chilling loop. Worst of all, he was plagued by a terrifying statue of the main character, Link, with a petrified grimace on its face. It kept appearing in the game out of nowhere \u2013 like a digital ghost. On YouTube, Jadusable posted video evidence of everything he had described. This game cartridge, it seemed, was haunted \u2013 inhabited by the spirit of its former owner, a child named Ben who had drowned in a tragic accident. Johri pored over every detail, rapt with morbid curiosity.\nAs the story unfolded through roughly 11,000-words of forum entries posted over the course of weeks, Jadusable described a haunting that soon extended beyond the game to other areas of his life. Eventually, after a series of increasingly disturbing experiences, the forum posts ceased, and Jadusable was never heard from again. This urban legend burst onto the web in 2010, traumatising a generation of young internet users. It became known as \"Ben Drowned\".\nBen Drowned left an indelible mark on the web and continues to spawn art and fan fiction long after it emerged. Though lesser-known outside gaming circles, the story and its accompanying videos racked up millions of views and have inspired other narratives in a similar vein.\nAt its core, Ben Drowned is a story about a ghost in a machine \u2013 one that speaks to our deepest fears about new technology. But it's more than an effective urban legend. Ben Drowned is a myth born from a medium that shaped a generation. In an era when video games were still often seen as a frivolous pastime for children, Ben Drowned was early proof that society's relationship with video games goes beyond childhood nostalgia, tapping into our deepest emotions \u2013 and maybe even our souls.\nBy the time Johri stumbled on Ben Drowned in around 2015, it was already widely acknowledged as fiction. But that didn't matter. That night, on Christmas Eve, as Johri lay in bed wrestling with insomnia, he could see in his mind's eye that creepy statue's grimace projected onto the faces of his family members. Rumour had it that Ben, the ghost from the corrupted Majora's Mask cartridge, had gone on to torment other people besides Jadusable. That's what the adolescent Johri couldn't shake, however irrational it seemed. The idea that Ben's evil presence might be out there. That it could spread.\nYears earlier, in September 2010, a real-life college student called Alex Hall hit \"publish\" on a forum post that would change his life forever. Hall had just started his second year at Saint Louis University in Missouri, US. He wasn't a fan of college. Here was his first taste of freedom as a so-called adult, and yet there were still all these classes to attend. He dreamt of becoming a famous author.\nAt the time, content called \"copypastas\" had become popular on forums such as 4chan and Something Awful. The term refers to the practice of copying and pasting blocks of text online, an early means of going viral \u2013 if such text proved popular enough to be shared widely. Ben Drowned is a canonical entry in an influential subgenre of copypasta called \"creepypasta\" \u2013 horror stories whose origins often become obscured as they spread across the web, thus adding to the mystery. Slender Man, a legend that was eventually turned into a big budget movie, is probably the most famous example.\nBy 2010, creepypastas had become extremely popular. But few of these stories concerned video games \u2013 despite the significance of games as cultural artefacts by that point. There were some examples, though, such as Polybius \u2013 a story that spread online in the early 2000s about mythical arcade game said to be part of a US government conspiracy.\nHall decided that the internet was missing something: an in-depth, video game-themed creepypasta. Gradually, his idea began to form: a haunted cartridge, a series of hoax-like forum posts, a narrator targeted by the evil entity within the game, and videos to back up these claims.\nHall knew how to make such videos using software to mod (modify) a game. He chose to use that software on Majora's Mask, Hall's favourite at the time. \"That game, to me, felt like the most alive video game that I had ever played, really,\" he says. Characters talk at length about their grief, or express denial about their impending doom, even while the moon, which is on a collision course with the world, edges closer and closer overhead. \"They have hopes and dreams,\" adds Hall.\nThe tale Hall came up with developed and amplified the grim mood of Majora's Mask, using the game as a springboard for a folk story about a troubled gamer. Hall's narrative leans on ominous lines of dialogue from the game. Most notably: \"You shouldn't have done that.\"\nThe idea of a haunted Nintendo 64 cartridge came in part from Hall's own experience of trawling through yard sales for video games. He once found a copy of Star Wars Episode I: Racer, based on the pod-racing sequence from that film. \"I was so bad at that game,\" recalls Hall. But the copy he found had a complete save file on it from the previous owner, meaning he could play as all the racers without having to unlock them first. This planted the seed that old game cartridges sometimes harboured surprises.\n\"A big part of gamer culture has always been about finding the secrets in different games,\" says John Sanders, assistant professor of English who studies media and literature at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, US. But while gamers seek to master the games they play, Ben Drowned is about a nightmare opposite scenario \u2013 this is a game that will master you.\nSanders points out that people have long told stories about corrupted or haunted media. The possessed game cartridge is just the latest in a line that includes ghostly radio broadcasts, cursed videotapes and demonic books. In Ben Drowned, Hall dangled the possibility that Ben might be able to haunt the reader too, via their computer. Another age-old ghost story trope: you're next.\nAfter months of toil, Hall finally published his creation. A few days later, he woke up and logged on, bleary-eyed, to his YouTube channel. The first video he'd posted for the story had jumped up to nearly 2,000 views. Hall had never had such a response online before, and the view counter just kept ticking upwards. He picked up the phone and called his father. \"Dad,\" Hall croaked, \"I think I've done something here.\"\n\"I actually remember reading it in my dorm room in college and sending it to some of my friends,\" says Alexander Zawacki, a digital humanities lecturer at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Germany, who describes the thrill of discovering creepypastas through links shared on internet forums. Readers felt as though they were \"getting into something a little bit secret\", he adds.\nZawacki is one of a few researchers who have published academic papers about Ben Drowned. It is a classic example of a spooky story that employs childhood nostalgia, he says \u2013 like horror films peppered with dolls, clowns and little children. \"They feel like relics of the past that come back to haunt you,\" says Zawacki.\nBen Drowned is a story that proves video games can be just as evocative.\nThat's significant, says Sanders. As video games matured, gaining more sophisticated graphics, complex characters and intricate storylines, they have given rise to entire subcultures \u2013 ardent gamers who trade knowledge about lore, cheat codes or hidden loot. They spend many hours exploring the digital worlds in the games they adore and sharing tales about the things they've seen that most people wouldn't believe.\nGamers' obsessions were leading to a \"boiling point\", adds Sanders, where a story like Ben Drowned had the chance of achieving real success.\nSanders also argues that Ben Drowned didn't just creep people out, it quite likely influenced later examples of urban legends about video games including Herobrine, a creepy, white-eyed character that supposedly appeared in Minecraft (but never actually did) and \"PBBV\", an evil spirit said to inhabit the virtual reality world of the game Gorilla Tag.\nThe creator of YouTube horror series Petscop, about a fictitious PlayStation One game that turns increasingly dark as the protagonist plays it, says he drew inspiration from Ben Drowned, among other sources.\nBen Drowned, which was first and foremost a text-based narrative complemented by video content, might seem anachronistic today. Zawacki says it's now more common to find stories like this presented in video-only formats.\nGaming writer and podcaster Marn Silverman, argues that while the delivery of Ben Drowned was \"of its time\", the story appears to have influenced a raft of video games built around the concept that they are possessed in one way or another \u2013 such as No Players Online, a supposedly haunted first-person shooter.\nIt's not surprising that a lot of these stories and games play on the nostalgia theme, says Emily Crawford, a digital media specialist in Washington DC who wrote about Ben Drowned while studying film and electronic media in graduate school. Games of the Nintendo 64 era, with their jagged, somewhat primitive 3D graphics, are especially good fodder for 21st Century ghost stories.\n\"The clunkier early technology left a lot more room for things to go wrong,\" Crawford says.\nTechnologies that are fallible have long given rise to anxiety and alarm. Ben Drowned is \"an articulation of the fears of the internet age\", says Sanders. \"Viruses, corruption, the blurring of the boundary between me at the computer and the computer itself.\"\nBen's desperation to haunt someone, and to spread to other people's computers via the internet, is a kind of demonic \"virality\", adds Sanders. It fits existing worries about the web and what we might find there, giving the concept an unsettling plausibility.\nFor many, experiences with Ben Drowned as a child were formative. Charlie Duke, a college student in the US, was around eight when he first heard about the story. He found a video about Ben Drowned and that, a mere summary of the original creepypasta, was enough to chill him to the bone.\n\"I immediately closed the video,\" he recalls. \"It got so stuck in my mind, it gave me anxiety for a long time.\" He even deleted a version of Majora's Mask he had on his computer, just to be safe. Duke says the ghost story played a significant role in debilitating anxiety attacks he suffered in the following years. He'd freeze up, hyperventilate and go completely pale. \"It was always looking for a trigger and Ben Drowned happened to be one of those triggers, or even the main one at the time.\"\nSaarthak Johri was also long-troubled by the story. The unnerving statue in the story that seemingly represented Ben's ghost, and the idea that he or his family members could be petrified in a similar way \"freaked me out so much\", he says.\nHall is aware that, for some people, Ben Drowned felt a little too real. \"That stuff sucks,\" he says, adding that accounts like Duke's have made him feel a little guilty at times. \"I want to tell people a story, I don't actually want to cause trauma.\"\nDespite the unpleasant experiences that Johri and Duke say they had after reading Ben Drowned, both have positive things to say about it today. \"It was kind of the first thing that connected me to other people in my middle school,\" says Johri. \"You have litmus tests for how online or digital people might be and knowing about these creepypastas is one of them.\"\nDuke says that Majora's Mask is one of his favourite games of all time. He has revisited Ben Drowned in the years since his first brush with the story and he notes that therapy has helped him to better understand and control his anxiety. \"It allowed me to look at myself in ways I don't think a lot of people my age [did],\" Duke says. \"I don't know if would thank Ben Drowned for that, but it definitely played a part.\"\nFor Hall, writing an internet ghost story has led to other ventures including a new YouTube series he plans to release later this year called Dead Save, featuring alternate versions of classic video games. As with Ben Drowned, he'll use modding tools to edit those original games and bring to life urban myths about them that have circled online. He also says he would love to release a playable version of the haunted Majora's Mask cartridge one day.\nBut, reflecting on Ben Drowned 15 years after its original publication, there's something else to consider. While ghost stories about technology and video games remain popular, Sanders points out that we are all, these days, very used to the idea that there could be some malevolent actor trying to control our computer or harm us through our devices. Whether that's an email scam, social media bots, ransomware or people targeting us with disinformation or abusive content.\nThe threat lurking within technology isn't demonic, it's us. The \"fantastic\" supernaturalism of Ben Drowned seems almost quaint in comparison.\n\"Now we're just like, 'Oh yeah, it's out there, there are Bens out there waiting to happen, waiting to control our computers',\" says Sanders. \"We just don't think they're fantastic anymore.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nSharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.\nPakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nPakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.\nLate on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.\nBut Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nOn 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\".

        "article_text": "The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX company operates on the southern tip of Texas is to officially become a city called Starbase. \nResidents approved incorporating a patch of land as the new municipality in an election on Saturday.\nMost of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote \"Starbase, Texas is now a real city!\" on his social media platform X.\nThe new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.\nThe city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.\nSince SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.\nAbout 500 people are estimated to live nearby.\nThe possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.\nThe first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. \nThe BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.\nStarbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.\nA bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.\nCurrently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.\n\nThe result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.\nThe top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.\nIn recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.\nThe headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.\nIn contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers \u2013 most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.\nEnvironmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. \nIn 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.\nThe company has called the fines the result of \"disagreements over paperwork\" and maintains it follows environmental laws.

        "article_text": "London is Europe's wealthiest city, yet for many living in the capital, having a place to call home feels out of reach, according to the Centre for London (CfL).\nEarlier this week, the independent think tank hosted the London Housing Summit, highlighting the challenges of - and possible solutions to - the housing crisis, which it says is \"spiralling out of control\".\nExperts agree it is a complex issue, but what do figures show us about the scale of the problem?\nAccording to data collected by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), there was an 8% increase in rough sleeping in the capital on the same period in 2024.\nNew rough sleepers account for almost half (47%) of the total number of those sleeping rough, intermittent rough sleepers account for 39% and 16% of the recorded number of rough sleepers were living on the streets.\nCHAIN's latest annual report for 2024/25 reveals rough sleeping in London has reached an \"all time high\".\nThe Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in London by 2030, and in January 2025 he announced an additional \u00a310m investment in a bid to achieve this goal.\nThe money will go towards expanding the network of its Ending Homelessness Hubs, which provide 24/7 specialist support for people new to rough sleeping and prevention services.\nCouncils have legal duty to house local people who become homeless. Typically, they put people up in hotels or hostels until more permanent arrangements can be made.\nSo, as homelessness has increased in recent years, so therefore has the financial burden on local authorities. \nThe umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is \"unsustainable\" and puts many councils at risk of becoming \"effectively bankrupt\", creating \"massive uncertainty\" to the future of local services.\nLondon Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by \u00a3330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.\nAccording to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.\nThis includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.\nThe human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.\nSpeaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a \"growing concern\" that people in temporary accommodation were \"internalising an issue that is a structural crisis\".\nLondon Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an \"emergency\" that was \"devastating the lives of too many Londoners\".\nThe organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions \u2013 like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change.\n\"We are providing \u00a31bn for crucial homelessness services so councils can support families faster. This is an increase of \u00a3233m from 2024 - 25, and London Boroughs have had a funding uplift by more than \u00a378m. \n\"We are also tackling its root causes by building 1.5 million new homes, boosting social and affordable housing and abolishing section 21 no fault evictions.\"\nThe private rental sector in London has shrunk, as landlords increasingly decide to sell their properties.\nAccording to analysis by Trust for London, 45,000 homes were lost from the sector in this way between April 2021-December 2023, equating to a net reduction of 4.3%.\nThe charity also said the sector was shrinking at a much faster rate the most affordable areas to rent in, which it believed had a \"particular impact\" on the ability of low-income households to access private rented homes.\nThe National Residential Landlords Association said \"uncertainty over proposed tax and regulatory changes is leading many landlords to consider leaving the market\". \nThe association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.\nLondon's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nPolling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.\nBoth the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.\nThe upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester. \nThe think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.\nThis comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is \"no time to waste\" and that it's \"crucial\" to \"get Britain building\".\nWhile targets are in place for new homes \u2013 delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London. \nCentre for London's polling revealed a third of Londoners have experienced damp and mould and over a quarter were unable to keep their homes warm.\nHousing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa uses social media to campaign on issues related to damp and mould and told Eddie Nestor on BBC Radio London, the situation is \"horrific\", adding \"there are times when I ask myself surely it cannot get worse than this?\".\nDuring the mayoral election campaign of 2024, Sir Sadiq pledged his support for a rollout of high-tech mould sensors, which City Hall said would provide an \"early warning system\". \nIndustry leaders have warned there is a 'dire shortage' of construction workers. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that there are over 35,000 job vacancies and employers report that over half of vacancies cannot be filled due to a lack of required skills \u2013 the highest rate of any sector.\nThe additional requirement of 160,000 construction workers applies specifically to meeting the need of Labour's housebuilding targets. Ahead of the government's pledge to build 1.5m new homes, the CITB had already estimated there would need to be a quarter of a million new construction workers to meet the country's housing demands.\nBefore the 2025 spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced \u00a3600m worth of investment to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers, and education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has committed to 'skills bootcamps' in the construction sector being expanded, with \u00a3100m to train, upskill and develop workers.\nSo what's the plan for London?\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Sir Sadiq Khan had made the capital's housing crisis a \"a key priority for his mayoralty\".\nIn 2018, City Hall established the Mayor's Construction Academy (MCA), a scheme aimed at helping Londoners gain the skills needed to enter the construction industry. \nThe mayor's office said it hoped the MCA would help address the need for more skilled construction workers in London.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. \nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn.

        "article_text": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands \u2013 and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia da Camerino steers her boat past the briccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible \u2013 to non-Venetians \u2013 lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground \u2013 and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nDa Camerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in the carciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as a castra\u00f9ra. The castra\u00f9re are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant \u2013 giving them their name \u2013 in order to allow the botoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for da Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castra\u00f9ra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat \u2013 not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castra\u00f9re are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castra\u00f9re's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto \u2013 this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like its terraferma counterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty \u2013 a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of an acqua alta (seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says da Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castra\u00f9re were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castra\u00f9ra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castra\u00f9re could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castra\u00f9re don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Da Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castra\u00f9re \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castra\u00f9re so they can hike up the prices.\"\nHow to try castra\u00f9re\n\u2022 Plan a trip to Venice around mid-April to hit the height of the castra\u00f9re season.\n\u2022 Always ring ahead to see if restaurants are serving them, since it's so dependent on the harvest.\n\u2022 If you want to try preparing them at home, make sure you only buy artichokes with the consorzio's label \u2013 and don't be afraid to grill the seller about where they come from.\n\u2022 If you miss the season, don't worry; you can buy a jar of violet artichokes preserved in oil from Finotello's farm on Sant'Erasmo.\n\u2022 You can also get them in liquid form: the amaro digestif Venesian is made from Sant'Erasmo artichokes. Pick up a bottle to take home at the delicatessen Maramao, which sells local products from its canalside shop in the Cannaregio district.\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castra\u00f9re when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years,\u00a0rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castra\u00f9re symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castra\u00f9re dishes: a silky, gently saut\u00e9ed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to da Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castra\u00f9re that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farm I Sapori di Sant'Erasmo with his brother Claudio and is also the president of the Consorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castra\u00f9re but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist \u2013 but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castra\u00f9re from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n \u2022\u00a0The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n \u2022\u00a0Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castra\u00f9re. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castra\u00f9ra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised with scoasse (garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castra\u00f9re he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices of colomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike \u2013 and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \n\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

        "article_text": "A second-hand Zelda cartridge. A cryptic forum thread. A generation of frightened children. This is the story of Ben Drowned \u2013 the internet's most infamous video game ghost.\nIt was Christmas Eve and 10-year-old Saarthak Johri couldn't sleep \u2013 but not because of excitement. He was shot through with fear. It was roughly a decade ago and Johri was a kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, in the US. He had spent the day slumped in an easy chair, staring at his phone, totally absorbed in an online urban myth. Johri knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. And yet, he was powerless to get it out of his mind.\nHe had found a trail of old forum posts supposedly written by a college student. The student, who used the online pseudonym Jadusable, had bought a strange copy of a Nintendo 64 video game at a yard sale. It was The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a notoriously dark instalment in the Zelda franchise, released 25 years ago this week on 27 April 2000.\nMajora's Mask is full of unnerving discussions about death, denial, fear, regret \u2013 and a looming apocalypse. But something was off about the cartridge Jadusable found. It had no label, just \"Majora\" scribbled on the plastic in marker. And something was seriously wrong with it.\nJadusable wrote that the game's familiar graphics were strange and distorted. Music played backwards in a spine-chilling loop. Worst of all, he was plagued by a terrifying statue of the main character, Link, with a petrified grimace on its face. It kept appearing in the game out of nowhere \u2013 like a digital ghost. On YouTube, Jadusable posted video evidence of everything he had described. This game cartridge, it seemed, was haunted \u2013 inhabited by the spirit of its former owner, a child named Ben who had drowned in a tragic accident. Johri pored over every detail, rapt with morbid curiosity.\nAs the story unfolded through roughly 11,000-words of forum entries posted over the course of weeks, Jadusable described a haunting that soon extended beyond the game to other areas of his life. Eventually, after a series of increasingly disturbing experiences, the forum posts ceased, and Jadusable was never heard from again. This urban legend burst onto the web in 2010, traumatising a generation of young internet users. It became known as \"Ben Drowned\".\nBen Drowned left an indelible mark on the web and continues to spawn art and fan fiction long after it emerged. Though lesser-known outside gaming circles, the story and its accompanying videos racked up millions of views and have inspired other narratives in a similar vein.\nAt its core, Ben Drowned is a story about a ghost in a machine \u2013 one that speaks to our deepest fears about new technology. But it's more than an effective urban legend. Ben Drowned is a myth born from a medium that shaped a generation. In an era when video games were still often seen as a frivolous pastime for children, Ben Drowned was early proof that society's relationship with video games goes beyond childhood nostalgia, tapping into our deepest emotions \u2013 and maybe even our souls.\nBy the time Johri stumbled on Ben Drowned in around 2015, it was already widely acknowledged as fiction. But that didn't matter. That night, on Christmas Eve, as Johri lay in bed wrestling with insomnia, he could see in his mind's eye that creepy statue's grimace projected onto the faces of his family members. Rumour had it that Ben, the ghost from the corrupted Majora's Mask cartridge, had gone on to torment other people besides Jadusable. That's what the adolescent Johri couldn't shake, however irrational it seemed. The idea that Ben's evil presence might be out there. That it could spread.\nYears earlier, in September 2010, a real-life college student called Alex Hall hit \"publish\" on a forum post that would change his life forever. Hall had just started his second year at Saint Louis University in Missouri, US. He wasn't a fan of college. Here was his first taste of freedom as a so-called adult, and yet there were still all these classes to attend. He dreamt of becoming a famous author.\nAt the time, content called \"copypastas\" had become popular on forums such as 4chan and Something Awful. The term refers to the practice of copying and pasting blocks of text online, an early means of going viral \u2013 if such text proved popular enough to be shared widely. Ben Drowned is a canonical entry in an influential subgenre of copypasta called \"creepypasta\" \u2013 horror stories whose origins often become obscured as they spread across the web, thus adding to the mystery. Slender Man, a legend that was eventually turned into a big budget movie, is probably the most famous example.\nBy 2010, creepypastas had become extremely popular. But few of these stories concerned video games \u2013 despite the significance of games as cultural artefacts by that point. There were some examples, though, such as Polybius \u2013 a story that spread online in the early 2000s about mythical arcade game said to be part of a US government conspiracy.\nHall decided that the internet was missing something: an in-depth, video game-themed creepypasta. Gradually, his idea began to form: a haunted cartridge, a series of hoax-like forum posts, a narrator targeted by the evil entity within the game, and videos to back up these claims.\nHall knew how to make such videos using software to mod (modify) a game. He chose to use that software on Majora's Mask, Hall's favourite at the time. \"That game, to me, felt like the most alive video game that I had ever played, really,\" he says. Characters talk at length about their grief, or express denial about their impending doom, even while the moon, which is on a collision course with the world, edges closer and closer overhead. \"They have hopes and dreams,\" adds Hall.\nThe tale Hall came up with developed and amplified the grim mood of Majora's Mask, using the game as a springboard for a folk story about a troubled gamer. Hall's narrative leans on ominous lines of dialogue from the game. Most notably: \"You shouldn't have done that.\"\nThe idea of a haunted Nintendo 64 cartridge came in part from Hall's own experience of trawling through yard sales for video games. He once found a copy of Star Wars Episode I: Racer, based on the pod-racing sequence from that film. \"I was so bad at that game,\" recalls Hall. But the copy he found had a complete save file on it from the previous owner, meaning he could play as all the racers without having to unlock them first. This planted the seed that old game cartridges sometimes harboured surprises.\n\"A big part of gamer culture has always been about finding the secrets in different games,\" says John Sanders, assistant professor of English who studies media and literature at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, US. But while gamers seek to master the games they play, Ben Drowned is about a nightmare opposite scenario \u2013 this is a game that will master you.\nSanders points out that people have long told stories about corrupted or haunted media. The possessed game cartridge is just the latest in a line that includes ghostly radio broadcasts, cursed videotapes and demonic books. In Ben Drowned, Hall dangled the possibility that Ben might be able to haunt the reader too, via their computer. Another age-old ghost story trope: you're next.\nAfter months of toil, Hall finally published his creation. A few days later, he woke up and logged on, bleary-eyed, to his YouTube channel. The first video he'd posted for the story had jumped up to nearly 2,000 views. Hall had never had such a response online before, and the view counter just kept ticking upwards. He picked up the phone and called his father. \"Dad,\" Hall croaked, \"I think I've done something here.\"\n\"I actually remember reading it in my dorm room in college and sending it to some of my friends,\" says Alexander Zawacki, a digital humanities lecturer at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Germany, who describes the thrill of discovering creepypastas through links shared on internet forums. Readers felt as though they were \"getting into something a little bit secret\", he adds.\nZawacki is one of a few researchers who have published academic papers about Ben Drowned. It is a classic example of a spooky story that employs childhood nostalgia, he says \u2013 like horror films peppered with dolls, clowns and little children. \"They feel like relics of the past that come back to haunt you,\" says Zawacki.\nBen Drowned is a story that proves video games can be just as evocative.\nThat's significant, says Sanders. As video games matured, gaining more sophisticated graphics, complex characters and intricate storylines, they have given rise to entire subcultures \u2013 ardent gamers who trade knowledge about lore, cheat codes or hidden loot. They spend many hours exploring the digital worlds in the games they adore and sharing tales about the things they've seen that most people wouldn't believe.\nGamers' obsessions were leading to a \"boiling point\", adds Sanders, where a story like Ben Drowned had the chance of achieving real success.\nSanders also argues that Ben Drowned didn't just creep people out, it quite likely influenced later examples of urban legends about video games including Herobrine, a creepy, white-eyed character that supposedly appeared in Minecraft (but never actually did) and \"PBBV\", an evil spirit said to inhabit the virtual reality world of the game Gorilla Tag.\nThe creator of YouTube horror series Petscop, about a fictitious PlayStation One game that turns increasingly dark as the protagonist plays it, says he drew inspiration from Ben Drowned, among other sources.\nBen Drowned, which was first and foremost a text-based narrative complemented by video content, might seem anachronistic today. Zawacki says it's now more common to find stories like this presented in video-only formats.\nGaming writer and podcaster Marn Silverman, argues that while the delivery of Ben Drowned was \"of its time\", the story appears to have influenced a raft of video games built around the concept that they are possessed in one way or another \u2013 such as No Players Online, a supposedly haunted first-person shooter.\nIt's not surprising that a lot of these stories and games play on the nostalgia theme, says Emily Crawford, a digital media specialist in Washington DC who wrote about Ben Drowned while studying film and electronic media in graduate school. Games of the Nintendo 64 era, with their jagged, somewhat primitive 3D graphics, are especially good fodder for 21st Century ghost stories.\n\"The clunkier early technology left a lot more room for things to go wrong,\" Crawford says.\nTechnologies that are fallible have long given rise to anxiety and alarm. Ben Drowned is \"an articulation of the fears of the internet age\", says Sanders. \"Viruses, corruption, the blurring of the boundary between me at the computer and the computer itself.\"\nBen's desperation to haunt someone, and to spread to other people's computers via the internet, is a kind of demonic \"virality\", adds Sanders. It fits existing worries about the web and what we might find there, giving the concept an unsettling plausibility.\nFor many, experiences with Ben Drowned as a child were formative. Charlie Duke, a college student in the US, was around eight when he first heard about the story. He found a video about Ben Drowned and that, a mere summary of the original creepypasta, was enough to chill him to the bone.\n\"I immediately closed the video,\" he recalls. \"It got so stuck in my mind, it gave me anxiety for a long time.\" He even deleted a version of Majora's Mask he had on his computer, just to be safe. Duke says the ghost story played a significant role in debilitating anxiety attacks he suffered in the following years. He'd freeze up, hyperventilate and go completely pale. \"It was always looking for a trigger and Ben Drowned happened to be one of those triggers, or even the main one at the time.\"\nSaarthak Johri was also long-troubled by the story. The unnerving statue in the story that seemingly represented Ben's ghost, and the idea that he or his family members could be petrified in a similar way \"freaked me out so much\", he says.\nHall is aware that, for some people, Ben Drowned felt a little too real. \"That stuff sucks,\" he says, adding that accounts like Duke's have made him feel a little guilty at times. \"I want to tell people a story, I don't actually want to cause trauma.\"\nDespite the unpleasant experiences that Johri and Duke say they had after reading Ben Drowned, both have positive things to say about it today. \"It was kind of the first thing that connected me to other people in my middle school,\" says Johri. \"You have litmus tests for how online or digital people might be and knowing about these creepypastas is one of them.\"\nDuke says that Majora's Mask is one of his favourite games of all time. He has revisited Ben Drowned in the years since his first brush with the story and he notes that therapy has helped him to better understand and control his anxiety. \"It allowed me to look at myself in ways I don't think a lot of people my age [did],\" Duke says. \"I don't know if would thank Ben Drowned for that, but it definitely played a part.\"\nFor Hall, writing an internet ghost story has led to other ventures including a new YouTube series he plans to release later this year called Dead Save, featuring alternate versions of classic video games. As with Ben Drowned, he'll use modding tools to edit those original games and bring to life urban myths about them that have circled online. He also says he would love to release a playable version of the haunted Majora's Mask cartridge one day.\nBut, reflecting on Ben Drowned 15 years after its original publication, there's something else to consider. While ghost stories about technology and video games remain popular, Sanders points out that we are all, these days, very used to the idea that there could be some malevolent actor trying to control our computer or harm us through our devices. Whether that's an email scam, social media bots, ransomware or people targeting us with disinformation or abusive content.\nThe threat lurking within technology isn't demonic, it's us. The \"fantastic\" supernaturalism of Ben Drowned seems almost quaint in comparison.\n\"Now we're just like, 'Oh yeah, it's out there, there are Bens out there waiting to happen, waiting to control our computers',\" says Sanders. \"We just don't think they're fantastic anymore.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.\nThere's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.\nSo what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?\nTo count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.\nFor someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.\nShe says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.\nRestricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"\nBut what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?\nMs Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.\nThey found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"\nAnd it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".\nBut - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.\nMs Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?\nThe definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.\n\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"\nBut the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.\nThe eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.\nAnother subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.\nToday, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.\nThe autism net has been cast wider.\nOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.\nStudies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.\nIt's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.\n\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"\nMs Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.\nShe says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".\nBecause autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nNow we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.\nShe says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.\nThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.\n\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"\nThere's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.\nFor Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.\nThe 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"\nShe says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"\nHer autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.\nBut others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.\nA focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".\nAs the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.\nThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.\nThe internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.\nDisproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.\nBut, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nIs there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?\nGinny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.\n\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"\nShe also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".\nBut Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.\n\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"\nYou can listen to The Autism Curve on BBC Sounds now",

        "article_text": "Conservatives in Canada are trading blame for Monday night's election loss, showing that Pierre Poilievre will need to heal divisions within the movement as he fights to stay on as leader.\nAs a clear Liberal win was emerging on election night, Conservative candidates and their supporters had one question: What the heck just happened?\nThe party had lost a remarkable 27-point lead in opinion polls and failed to win an election for the fourth time in a row. \nAnd while it gained seats and earned almost 42% of the popular vote - its highest share since the party was founded in 2003 - its leader Poilievre was voted out of the seat he had held for the past 20 years.\n\"Nobody's happy about that,\" Shakir Chambers, a Conservative strategist and vice-president of Ontario-based consultancy firm the Oyster Group, told the BBC.\nThe party is now trying to work out how it will move forward.\nAt the top of the agenda will be finding a way for the Conservatives to perform their duties as the Official Opposition - the second-place party in Canada's parliament whose job is to hold the sitting government to account - without their leader in the House.\nAhead of a caucus meeting next Tuesday to discuss this, Poilievre announced on Friday his plan to run in an Alberta constituency special election to win back a seat.\nThat special election will be triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP-elect Damien Kurek, who said he will voluntarily step down to let Poilievre back in after what he called \"a remarkable national campaign\".\n\"An unstoppable movement has grown under his leadership, and I know we need Pierre fighting in the House of Commons,\" Kurek said in a statement.\nUnlike the US, federal politicians in Canada do not have to live in the city or province they run in. Poilievre grew up in Alberta, however, and will likely win handily as the constituency he is running in is a Conservative stronghold.\nA big question is whether Poilievre still has the backing of his own party to stay on as leader.  Mr Chambers said the answer, so far, is a resounding yes.\n\"Pierre has a lot of support in the caucus,\" he said. \"I don't think there's anybody that wants him removed, or that has super high ambitions that wants to replace him as leader.\"\nA number of high-profile Conservatives have already rallied behind him. One of them is Andrew Scheer, a current MP and former leader of the party, who said Poilievre should stay on to \"ensure we finish the job next time\".\nOthers are casting blame on where they went wrong.\nJamil Jivani, who won his own constituency in a suburb of Toronto handily, felt that Ontario leader Doug Ford had betrayed the conservative movement and cost the party the election.\nThe federal and provincial Conservative parties are legally different entities, though they belong to the same ideological tent, and Ford is leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.\nHe frequently made headlines during the election campaign for his get-tough attitude with Donald Trump and the US president's trade war. \n\"He couldn't stay out of our business,\" Jivani told a CBC reporter.\nJivani, who in a past life attended Yale University with US Vice-President JD Vance, where the two became good friends, accused Ford of distracting from the federal Conservatives' campaign and of \"positioning himself as some political genius that we need to be taking cues from\".\nBut Mr Chambers, the Conservative strategist, said that Poilievre will also need to confront where the party fell short.\nPoilievre, who is known for his combative political style, has struggled with being unlikeable among the general Canadian public.\nHe has also failed to shore up the support of popular Conservative leaders in some provinces, like Ontario's Ford, who did not campaign for Poilievre despite his recent landslide victory in a provincial election earlier this year. Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.\n\"Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,\" Ford told reporters earlier this week. \"Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'\".\n\"Isn't that ironic?\"\nAnother Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some \"soul-searching\" after its loss.\n\"I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,\" Houston said.\nNot every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.\nKory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.\nHe told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.\n\"What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,\" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.\n\"There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,\" Mr Teneycke said. \n\"Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.\"\nHe added he believes some of the \"soul-searching\" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country \"as big and diverse as Canada\".\nAsked by reporters what it would take to heal the rift, Ford answered: \"All they have to do is make a phone call.\"",

A fighter not trying to win and just trying to survive. I hate those kind of fighters,\" Alvarez, 34, said.\nCrawford entered the ring post-fight and two of the sport's biggest names posed for a face-off.\nThey will meet at the 65,000-seater Allegiant Stadium on 12 September.\nCrawford, 37, is a four-division and two-weight undisputed champion but will be moving up from light-middleweight.\n\"Everything happens for a reason and there's a reason why I'm here. In September I'll show the world what greatness looks like,\" he said.\nWBA, WBC, WBO and IBF champion Alvarez becomes the fourth male boxer to become a two-time undisputed champion in the four-belt era, joining Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk and Naoya Inoue.\nFighting outside of Mexico or America for the first time as a professional, Alvarez made his ring walk at the unusually early 06:20 local time to cater for audiences back home.\nAs he often does, Alvarez started slowly to feel out his opponent. He landed right and left hooks to the body in the second round and Scull sneaked an uppercut through Alvarez's guard in the third.\nBut Alvarez was unable to apply any real pressure and was being made to miss by 32-year-old Cuban Scull's movement.\nScull walked back to the corner smiling after the seventh, as if he felt he was on course for the upset.\nWith little action happening inside the ring, the cameras panned to a bored-looking Crawford at ringside.\n\"Let's fight, there's too much running around,\" British referee Kieran McCann told both fighters before the ninth.\nVisibly annoyed with his opponent's approach, Alvarez shook his head as he walked back to his corner after the 10th.\nScull complained about low blows, most of which were legitimate punches, and Alvarez was warned for punching when his opponent had his back turned in the 11th. \nThe closer scorecards reflected how neither fighter asserted their dominance in the tedious contest. \n\"He came just to survive until the 12th round,\" Alvarez said after his 63rd career win.\n\"I hope September will be another kind of fight.\"\nBoxing powerhouse Turki Alalshikh announced the Alvarez-Crawford super-fight \nAlvarez was stripped of the IBF belt instead of facing Scull last year but once again becomes the king of the super-middleweight division.\nHe said it would be a \"pleasure\" to defend all four recognised world titles against Crawford.\n\"Crawford is one of the best out there and I like to share with that kind of fighter,\" Alvarez said.\nCrawford is the reigning WBA light-middleweight champion and has won all 41 pro bouts but is likely to be a slight underdog because of his weight disadvantage.\nHe described the blockbuster against Alvarez as the \"biggest fight of the past decade\".\nWhile it has the potential to break box office and gate receipt records, some boxing purists feel Alvarez has ducked the hard-hitting David Benavidez, an unbeaten American fighter with Mexican heritage who has 24 stoppages in 30 wins and is nicknamed 'The Mexican Monster'.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

'He just came to survive' \u2013 Alvarez frustrated in points winImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, WBA, WBC, WBO and IBF champion Alvarez becomes the fourth male boxer to become a two-time undisputed champion in the four-belt era, joining Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk and Naoya Inoue.Fighting outside of Mexico or America for the first time as a professional, Alvarez made his ring walk at the unusually early 06:20 local time to cater for audiences back home.As he often does, Alvarez started slowly to feel out his opponent. \"He came just to survive until the 12th round,\" Alvarez said after his 63rd career win. \"Crawford is one of the best out there and I like to share with that kind of fighter,\" Alvarez said.Crawford is the reigning WBA light-middleweight champion and has won all 41 pro bouts but is likely to be a slight underdog because of his weight disadvantage.He described the blockbuster against Alvarez as the \"biggest fight of the past decade\".While it has the potential to break box office and gate receipt records, some boxing purists feel Alvarez has ducked the hard-hitting David Benavidez, an unbeaten American fighter with Mexican heritage who has 24 stoppages in 30 wins and is nicknamed 'The Mexican Monster'.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published2 days agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 January \"Canelo & Crawford set for 'biggest fight of past decade'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Boxing powerhouse Turki Alalshikh announced the Alvarez-Crawford super-fight Alvarez was stripped of the IBF belt instead of facing Scull last year but once again becomes the king of the super-middleweight division.He said it would be a \"pleasure\" to defend all four recognised world titles against Crawford.",

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

The vehicle is currently in Bethlehem, and will enter Gaza if and when Israel opens a humanitarian corridor.\nThe war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 15,000 children and displaced nearly one million since it erupted in October 2023, Unicef reports. \nIsrael has blocked humanitarian aid from entering the Strip for more than two months, which has left \"families struggling to survive\" as food, clean water and medicines reach critically low levels, the UN agency for children said.\nFor now, Caritas will have to wait until Israel reopens the aid corridor - but when that happens, they say they will be ready.\n\"With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to health care \u2013 children who are injured and malnourished,\" Peter Brune, Secretary General of Caritas Sweden, said in a statement.\nA team of doctors will run the mobile clinic, which will have the capabilities to examine and treat patients, and there will be a dedicated driver.

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

        "article_text": "Sam Simmonds, the then Exeter number eight, was the bolter in 2021's socially distanced squad announcement\nBolter: Noun, Australian informal - an outsider in a contest or race.\nPerhaps it was a term picked up on a previous tour down under. For whatever reason, in the northern hemisphere at least, the concept of a bolter has become synonymous with Lions squad selection.\nIt refers to the inexperienced, overlooked and out of favour. Players propelled from leftfield to centre stage and on to the plane with the best of Britain and Ireland.\nBack row Sam Simmonds, who had not been chosen for England in three years, was that pick when the Lions toured South Africa in 2021.\nSome bolters have blossomed into Lions greats.\nJeremy Guscott and Martin Johnson had each made just one appearance for England before playing for the Lions. Jason Robinson was still learning the game after switching from rugby league.\nOther gambles have not paid such dividends.\nHere are nine potential picks, all less than probable but the right side of impossible, to listen out for when Wales great Ieuan Evans announces the squad on Thursday.\nFarrell has not played Test rugby since 2023, after taking a break from internationals before moving to Racing 92\n\"I'd pick Owen Farrell. Who do you want in there when the going gets tough? Test-match animals.\"\nBack in October when he was asked by the Times who should start at fly-half, external for the first Test against the Wallabies, Johnny Sexton was retired from playing, working for a glass company and publicising his autobiography.\nNow, intriguingly, Sexton has been signed up as a coach for the tour.\nThe fallout would be substantial, but head coach Andy Farrell might judge selecting his son worth it.\nWith little Lions Test experience among other potential 10s, three-time tourist Farrell brings an accountability and intensity few can match.\nEven as a 21-year-old tour rookie in Australia in 2013, his communication and leadership were picked out as an example to the rest of the squad by captain Alun Wyn Jones.\nFarrell has endured a difficult, injury-interrupted season with French club Racing 92, though he and his team have come into some welcome form recently, winning five out of seven matches since the former Saracen's comeback from a groin problem in March.\nHowever, his final chance to press his case ended early when a head knock forced an early exit from Sunday's European Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Lyon \nMurray was born and brought up in New Zealand but qualifies for Wales via his mother\nAfter a wretched run of 17 successive Test defeats and with no Welsh voice among Andy Farrell's support staff, representation from The Dragons could be at an all-time low.\nWales have never supplied fewer than five players for a Lions squad. If they are to get up towards that figure again, then Blair Murray could be on the plane.\nThe Lions do not have huge depth at full-back.\nIreland's Hugo Keenan will likely tour, but Scotland's first-choice 15 Blair Kinghorn suffered a knee knock recently and would be a late arrival on tour with Toulouse destined for Top 14 play-offs.\nEngland have shuffled between George Furbank, Freddie Steward and Marcus Smith over the past year.\nMurray, all scampering pace and jagging sidesteps, would be a crowd-pleasing pick. The sort of player who might revel on midweek hard grounds against Australia's Super Rugby sides.\nOsborne has scored 12 points, via two tries and a conversion, in his seven caps\nDebuts do not come much more imposing than away and at altitude against the world champion Springboks. Add playing in a position you have not started a game in for nearly two years and you understand the extent of Jamie Osborne's Test baptism.\nHowever, the 23-year-old scored a try, kept his place and was part of a team that shared the series spoils in South Africa.\nOsborne is a slight but rangy runner, with deft hands, aerial ability, a kicking game and an understanding with the Leinster and Ireland team-mates who will make up a large touring contingent. \nThe clincher though could be his versatility.\nCovering full-back, wing and centre is useful on a hectic tour and would potentially give Farrell more licence to load the bench with forwards.\nJordan made his professional debut in September 2022\nAnother with the ability to fill a few backline vacancies.\nJordan was playing semi-professional rugby with Ayrshire Bulls until 2021 and only made his Scotland debut in November.\nHe has seized the chance opened up by an injury to Sione Tuipulotu though, and was integral to Scotland's sharp backline in the Six Nations, with clever support lines, a step and a good offloading game.\nWith England's Ollie Lawrence out through injury - one of the favourites for a midfield role in Australia - Jordan could benefit from another's misfortune once again.\nBound for Bristol next season, the New Zealand-born Glasgow star can also back up fly-half and full-back.\nFord was England's starting fly-half in every game in the 2024 Six Nations, but has not done so since\nCan a bolter come with 99 Test caps already to their name?\nGeorge Ford has slipped down the England fly-half pecking order, with first Marcus Smith and then Fin Smith steering the ship.\nBut Ford has been in dazzling club form for Sale, playing close to the line and easing open holes for himself or runners.

one of the favourites for a midfield role in Australia - Jordan could benefit from another's misfortune once again.Bound for Bristol next season, the New Zealand-born Glasgow star can also back up fly-half and full-back.George FordImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ford was England's starting fly-half in every game in the 2024 Six Nations, but has not done so sinceCan a bolter come with 99 Test caps already to their name?George Ford has slipped down the England fly-half pecking order, with first Marcus Smith and then Fin Smith steering the ship.But Ford has been in dazzling club form for Sale, playing close to the line and easing open holes for himself or runners. \"Back in October when he was asked by the Times who should start at fly-half, external for the first Test against the Wallabies, Johnny Sexton was retired from playing, working for a glass company and publicising his autobiography.Now, intriguingly, Sexton has been signed up as a coach for the tour.The fallout would be substantial, but head coach Andy Farrell might judge selecting his son worth it.With little Lions Test experience among other potential 10s, three-time tourist Farrell brings an accountability and intensity few can match.Even as a 21-year-old tour rookie in Australia in 2013, his communication and leadership were picked out as an example to the rest of the squad by captain Alun Wyn Jones.Farrell has endured a difficult, injury-interrupted season with French club Racing 92, though he and his team have come into some welcome form recently, winning five out of seven matches since the former Saracen's comeback from a groin problem in March.However, his final chance to press his case ended early when a head knock forced an early exit from Sunday's European Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Lyon Blair MurrayImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Murray was born and brought up in New Zealand but qualifies for Wales via his motherAfter a wretched run of 17 successive Test defeats and with no Welsh voice among Andy Farrell's support staff, representation from The Dragons could be at an all-time low.Wales have never supplied fewer than five players for a Lions squad. Players propelled from leftfield to centre stage and on to the plane with the best of Britain and Ireland.Back row Sam Simmonds, who had not been chosen for England in three years, was that pick when the Lions toured South Africa in 2021.Some bolters have blossomed into Lions greats.Jeremy Guscott and Martin Johnson had each made just one appearance for England before playing for the Lions.

The fifth person's nationality and age has not been confirmed.\nThe Met said the \"affected site\" allegedly targeted in the plot had been made aware and was being supported by police.\nFootage showed armed officers taking a man from a house in Rochdale, while another man was dragged through the street in Swindon with plastic bags over his arms. It is understood military personnel were involved in the Rochdale raid.\nIn Swindon, one eyewitness told the BBC that six men entered a cafe the suspect was in and ordered coffee and donuts before they followed him out and \"jumped on him\".\nSeparately, the Met said three Iranian men - aged 39, 44 and 55 - were arrested under section 27 of the National Security Act at addresses in north-west and west London, while searches continued.\nThe act covers offences deemed a threat to national security. Section 27 grants police the power to arrest someone without a warrant if they are reasonably suspected of being involved in \"foreign power threat activity\".\nCdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, stressed that they were not linking the two investigations.\nHe said the operations were \"certainly significant and it is unusual for us to conduct this scale of activity\".\nLast year MI5 said it had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022.\nDirector general Sir Ken McCallum, said these presented \"potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents\".\nThere have previously been calls to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - a major military and political force with close ties to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.\nThis would allow tighter control of UK borders and \"severe penalties\" for those who might be supporting the group\", Nick Aldworth, a former national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing, said.\n\"It becomes quite challenging when organisations that are proscribed are effectively part of the state,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nHe added it was \"unclear\" how much support the group had in the UK.\nJonathan Hall KC, an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the public was not aware of \"how aggressive Iran is willing to be\", adding UK authorities \"undoubtedly\" need more tools to deal with this particular case.\nThe use of the internet to organise attacks should be examined \"remorselessly,\" and people made aware of the full extent of the law, he told the BBC.
