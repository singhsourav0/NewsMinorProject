        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nStokes strikes after Brook 99 in tight first Test\nFirst Rothesay Test, Headingley (day three of five)\nIndia 471 (Gill 147, Pant 134, Jaiswal 101; Stokes 4-66, Tongue 4-86) & 90-2\nEngland 465 (Pope 106, Brook 99, Duckett; Bumrah 5-83)\nIndia lead by 96 runs\nScorecard\nEngland captain Ben Stokes checked India's progress after Harry Brook's breathtaking 99 on a helter-skelter third day of the first Test at Headingley.\nThe tourists were painstakingly building their lead when Stokes had Sai Sudharsan clip to mid-wicket, leaving India 90-2 and with an advantage of 96 runs at the close.\nIndia had earlier bowled England out for 465, claiming a first-innings lead of six runs.\nBrook, who was caught off a no-ball late on day two, was dropped twice. He played some outrageous strokes and looked set for a century on his home ground until he top-edged a hook to long leg.\nEngland were still 73 behind when Brook became the seventh man out, only for the hosts to be taken to virtual parity by a rapid stand of 55 between Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse.\nWoakes was eventually bowled by the irrepressible Jasprit Bumrah, who did the same to Shoaib Bashir to end with 5-83.\nEngland had the momentum, even more so when Carse had Yashasvi Jaiswal caught behind. Headingley was rocking, which made the stand of 66 between debutant Sudharsan and KL Rahul all the more impressive.\nWith drizzle threatening and the light closing in, Stokes removed Sudharsan for 30. When the umpires decided play could not continue, Rahul had 47, alongside captain Shubman Gill on six. It is beautifully poised.\nWhy Bumrah is most complete fast bowler ever - Finn\nWatch Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer\nIndia lead England by 96 with first Test in balance - as it happened\nThis video can not be played\nRelay catch between Jadeja and Sudharsan dismisses Smith for 40\nThis has been three days of wonderful, see-saw Test cricket, living up to the pre-match billing of two high-quality and evenly matched teams.\nAfter England gifted away the chance to bat first, India have been just as generous in return. The visitors should have got many more than their first-innings 471, then dropped four catches, including three off Bumrah, the man culpable for Brook's no-ball reprieve.\nFor as well as they have battled back, England can also reflect on their own wasted opportunities and moments of recklessness.\nA blustery Sunday showed the best and worst of Bazball. Jamie Smith fell into a bouncer trap two balls after hooking a six, in the over before the second new-ball was due, while Brook was also bounced out.\nIn contrast, the attacking intent of Woakes and Carse scrambled Indian minds and kept England in it.\nEven the final session, with the lights on and clouds threatening, swung this way and that. England will have to chase on a pitch starting to look dry and uneven, so India might be slight favourites.\nThis video can not be played\n'Can you believe it!' Brook out for 99\nReprieved as England reached 209-3 on Saturday, Brook began Sunday by stretching his time on nought to 15 balls. He exploded into life at the end of the first over, slashing Prasidh Krishna for four then belting six over mid-wicket, and never looked back.\nOllie Pope was out to his sixth ball of the day for 106, edging a cut off Krishna, while Stokes was circumspect for 20 before tamely poking Mohammed Siraj behind.\nBrook was full of intent. He danced down to hit Bumrah through the covers and found a similarly purposeful ally in Smith for their stand of 73. Brook was spilled by wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant off spinner Ravindra Jadeja on 46, then fourth slip Jaiswal off Bumrah on 82.\nSmith was strong on the pull, which made his surrender on 40 to Krishna via a relay catch between Jadeja and Sudharsan all the more frustrating.\nDespite losing Smith, Brook climbed into the second new ball in a feisty duel with Siraj. One blow over long-on for six was disdainful. A single away from three figures, he top-edged Krishna into the hands of Shardul Thakur and the disappointment around Headingley was palpable. Brook threw his head back in disbelief, the 16th occasion an England man has been dismissed on 99 in a Test.\nWoakes continued the assault. He pulled and ramped Krishna for successive sixes in his 38. The stand with Carse was riotous entertainment, only ended when Carse made room and was bowled by Siraj for 22. Bumrah did the rest.\nThis video can not be played\n'Superstar' Bumrah bowls Tongue for five-wicket haul as England all out for 465\nAt 430-3 on Saturday morning, India had the game in their grasp. Then Gill holed out off Bashir and his team were second-best for much of what has followed.\nThe drops were their most in a Test innings for five years, the slip cordon missing the retired Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.\nThough spinner Jadeja was tidy, the seamers leaked boundaries and even the great Bumrah did not quite reach the standard he set on Saturday, though that was a very high bar.\nThere was petulance over a number of attempts to get the ball changed - at one point Pant threw it away after being denied by umpire Paul Reiffel. When the second new ball was taken, it was bizarre to be bowling a bouncer plan to Woakes and Carse, England's eight and nine.\nAfter Jaiswal edged Carse off the back foot, India could have imploded. Sudharsan, on a pair, showed great composure and was strong on the cut, while Rahul followed his first-innings 42 with more handsome cover drives.\nSudharsan was badly dropped by Ben Duckett at deep gully off Josh Tongue, only for Stokes, swinging the ball, to induce a loose shot that was pouched by Zak Crawley.\nThis video can not be played\n'Brilliantly played!' - Woakes hits Krishna for back-to-back sixes\nEngland batter Ollie Pope, speaking to BBC Test Match Special: \"I was really happy. It was annoying to not kick on today but it was a good challenge yesterday with the new ball.\n\"That late wicket at the end puts us in an even position. We know we have runs to chase but if we can keep playing as we are, we know we can put together a good score.\"\nIndia fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah on TMS: \"The game is in the balance. We have to bat well. \n\"I like to enjoy my time on the field so I always smile. Nobody is dropping catches purposefully and sometimes the cold makes it difficult to catch. I try not to let if affect me and move forwards quickly.\"\nFormer England captain Sir Alastair Cook on TMS: \"England will certainly be the happier of the two sides. Their belief in their ability to knock off a total is unprecedented.\"\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

He spent nearly eight days there.\nAx-4 is led by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson - a space veteran who has been commander of ISS twice, spent hundreds of days in space and done 10 space walks. \nThe team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary - just like the Indian astronaut, they will also be taking their countries back to space after more than four decades. \nExperts say the pilot's role is key, as he would serve as second-in-command to the mission commander, assisting with spacecraft operations during launch, docking, undocking and return to Earth.\nThe astronauts, who have been in quarantine since 25 May to prepare for the trip, addressed a press conference on Tuesday night where they showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be \"the fifth crew member\" on Ax-4.\n\"We are good for the launch, we have completed all the training and the team has bonded well,\" Commander Whitson said.\nDescribing the past year as \"nothing short of transformative\" for him, Group Captain Shukla said he did not have words to describe his excitement.\n\"It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,\" he said. \n\"As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.\n\"I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,\" he added.\nThe 39-year-old was among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on the country's first-ever human space flight, scheduled for 2027.\nThe Gaganyaan mission aims to send three astronauts to an orbit of 400km and bring them back after three days. India has also announced ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nIndia's space agency Isro has been carrying out a number of tests to prepare for Gaganyaan. In December, it plans to send a female humanoid robot to space as part of the tests.\nSo, officials say the mission comes as a \"unique exciting opportunity\" for Isro and has generated a lot of interest in India.\nThe trip to ISS aboard Ax-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private company Axiom Space - is a collaborative effort between Nasa, Isro and European Space Agency (Esa).\nTuesday's flight will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket. \nIsro, which has paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla and his training, says the experience he will gain during his trip to the ISS will help India immensely.\n\"The benefit we will get from this mission is phenomenal in terms of the training, exposure to the facilities and the experience of jointly conducting experiments in space,\" Isro Chairman V Narayanan recently said.\nSudeesh Balan, Isro project director, said Group Captain Shukla had been training since August last year. \n\"He's undergone rigorous training, including physical and psychological assessments, to prepare for the journey.\"\nBorn on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the Indian air force as a fighter pilot in 2006. \nAccording to Axiom Space, he has over 2,000 hours of flying experience and has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks.\nHis sister Shuchi Mishra, however, told the BBC that his entry into the air force was \"accidental\".\n\"When he was 17 and in high school, his friend got a form to apply to the National Defence Academy. But this friend was slightly overage so he was not qualified. Not wanting to waste the form, Shubhanshu filled it up,\" Ms Mishra said.\n\"He was selected - and has never looked back.\"\nMs Mishra says their family \"is thrilled as one of ours has been chosen out of India's 1.4 billion people\" for this mission.\n\"We all feel so privileged and proud that he's a part of our family and that we've been a part of his journey.\"\nHer brother, she says, is undertaking this journey for his country - for the next generation.\n\"He always tells people to dream big, to do something for the nation. We are hoping that his trip will inspire the next generation.\"\nBesides piloting the mission, the Indian astronaut will have a busy schedule during his time on ISS.\nConsidering the huge interest in the flight, Isro has said they are organising events for him to interact with Indian students and answer their questions while floating in space.\n\"We believe it will motivate our young minds to become passionate about space tech,\" Mr Balan said.\nBut most of the time, the four-member crew will be conducting 60 scientific experiments, seven of which come from India. \nFormer Nasa scientist Mila Mitra says Isro's experiments will help improve our understanding of space and its effects on biology and micro-gravity.\nOne of the key experiments, she explains, will investigate the impact of spaceflight on six varieties of crop seeds. \n\"This project aims to help understand how crops may be grown in space for future exploration missions. After the mission, seeds will be grown for multiple generations and plants showing preferred traits will be selected for genetic analyses.\"\nAnother Isro experiment involves growing three strains of microalgae which could be used as food, fuel or even in life support systems and this will help identify the most suitable ones for growing in microgravity, she says.\nThe Isro projects would also investigate how tardigrades - micro-animals on Earth that can survive extreme environments - would fare in space. \n\"The project will examine the revival of dormant tardigrades, count the number of eggs laid and hatched during a mission, and compare space-flown versus ground control populations,\" Ms Mitra says.\nThe other experiments aim to identify how muscle loss occurs in space and how it can be treated; and the physical and cognitive impact of using computer screens in microgravity. \n\"The research will study how gaze fixation and rapid eye movements are affected by being in space, and how this may affect an astronaut's stress and wellbeing. The results could influence future spacecraft computer design and interaction,\" she says.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "In Manhattan's West Village, where culinary trends can change with the seasons, Chef Vijay Kumar is shaping a quiet revolution. \nHis 2025 James Beard Award win for Best Chef: New York State this month is more than just personal recognition - it marks a cultural inflection point. \nChennai-based culinary historian Rakesh Raghunathan says: \"Following in the footsteps of fellow Tamil-origin recipients like Raghavan Iyer and Padma Lakshmi, Vijay Kumar's recognition reflects a growing momentum for south Indian voices on the global culinary stage\". \n\"Tamil cuisine -  along with Sri Lankan Tamil and other south Indian regional traditions - is increasingly being embraced by global diners as something refined, rich, and deeply rooted in culture.\"\nBorn in the small farming village of Natham in southern Tamil Nadu, the 44-year-old Kumar has always cooked from memory - of forests and foraging, firewood stoves and his mother and grandmother serving meals made from scratch for the family.\nWhen he took the stage at the JB awards ceremony, he said \"the food I grew up on, the food made with care, with fire, with soul is now taking the main stage\". It was a moment of deep emotion and cultural pride for Kumar. \n\"There is no such thing as a poor person's food, or a rich person's food. It's food. It's powerful. And the real luxury is to be able to connect with each other around the dinner table.\"\nFor Kumar, the win is a personal milestone but also a powerful act of visibility. \n\"When I started cooking, I never thought a dark-skinned boy from Tamil Nadu could make it to a room like this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. It was therefore important for him to wear veshti, the traditional Tamil attire for men, for the black-tie James Beard ceremony as a nod to his roots.\nRecently, Kumar was trolled by a pair of influencers in New York. Quick to rise to his defence was Padma Lakshmi, cookbook author and culinary ambassador, who called the influencers out for their cultural insensitivity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Lakshmi said \"Vijay's story is important not just for south Indian food but also as a story of someone who grew up with humble means and cooked with limited resources.\" \n\"This resourcefulness has not only propelled his work ethic but enhanced his sense of flavour, ingredients and sense of the world. He is a beacon of hope to young people all over the world that if you trust and develop your senses and skills, you can go far in a creative career.\"\nKumar's journey wasn't smooth to start with. \nUnable to afford engineering school in the big city, he chose culinary school instead - beginning his journey at Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai, cooking his way through cruise ships and kitchens, and eventually finding his promised land in America, working at Dosa in San Francisco. \nHis real breakthrough came when he partnered with Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya of Unapologetic Foods, a New York restaurant group, to open Semma - a Tamil slang word for \"fantastic\" in 2021.\nThe trio found a \"shared sense of wanting to honour our heritage, to tell the world who we really are through our cuisine\". \n\"At that moment, it wasn't just about food, it was about identity,\" Mazumdar told the BBC. \"For too long, Indian food in the US has lived under the veil of a manufactured, watered-down north-western lens. With Semma, we set out to pull back that curtain and share something more honest.\"\nKumar jumped at the opportunity to share his cuisine with the world. \"His eyes lit up when we started talking about the food we grew up eating, and that kind of food rarely makes it to restaurant menus,\" recalls Mazumdar.\nKumar's strength lies in serving authentic village food that is seasonal, hyper-local, and built entirely from scratch. His farm-to-table approach, he says, was to cook the way \"my mother and grandmother did\". Semma, he adds, is a celebration of that simplicity.\nThat simplicity resonates. \nSemma's menu defies the clich\u00e9s that often define Indian food abroad. There's no butter chicken or naan here and Kumar's epiphany came with an unlikely encounter: French escargot. \nAs a child, on days when rice was scarce, he would forage with his family for snails in the paddy fields, which would be cooked in a savoury tamarind sauce. Kumar admitted that he was ashamed of it as a boy as it \"felt like food born of poverty - until I saw the pride with which the French serve escargot\". \nToday, the dish, nathai pirattal, sits proudly on Semma's menu, reimagined not as a memory of scarcity, but as a symbol of resilience and cultural pride. \nSemma's menu - pepper rasam, tamarind crab, banana flower vadai, the ubiquitous dosa - offer an emotional connection for many diaspora diners, and a revelation for first-timers.\nKumar's intention to bring village-style Tamil food and showcase it in upscale spots and in the cut-throat New York restaurant space has won a long line of admirers. \nThere's depth, regionality and a powerful emotional connection in this food. \nThe cocktails are a nod to Tamil film stars like Rajnikanth and Silk Smitha, and the d\u00e9cor channels Chennai's warmth. Even the kitchen is a space of intention - cooks are asked to prepare food with \"gratitude and mindfulness\".\n\"I invited him to curate a black-tie gala dinner for 650 guests at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles, and he made us all proud. A year later, people still talk about how incredible the food was,\" says Lakshmi, applauding Kumar's gift for bringing regional Indian cuisine to the most glamorous platforms.\nThe awards and accolades feel like a natural progression of his journey. Semma is the first New York restaurant serving only south Indian cuisine to win a Michelin star and topped The New York Times's list for top 100 restaurants. And now the JBA for Kumar.\nIn many ways, Kumar is not just serving food - he is serving memory, pride and a quiet revolution. \nHis James Beard win is a recognition of his talent, but also an affirmation that regional Indian cuisine, with its bold spices and soulful simplicity, belongs at the centre of the global table.\nKumar's win has piqued the \"curiosity of young people from all over the Indian diaspora and instilled a greater pride in our food ways\", says Lakshmi. \"This will be his greatest legacy.\"\nAdds Mazumdar, \"This win is a signal that regionality matters, and that our stories and our roots have value on the world stage.\"",

        "article_text": "A state-of-the-art British fighter jet stuck at an airport in India for nearly three weeks now has sparked curiosity and raised questions about how such a modern aircraft could get stranded for days in a foreign country.\nThe F-35B landed at Thiruvananthapuram airport in the southern state of Kerala on 14 June.\nThe aircraft was diverted there after it ran into bad weather during a sortie in the Indian ocean and was unable to return to HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's flagship carrier.\nIt landed safely but it has since developed a technical snag and is unable to return to the carrier.\nSince the jet's landing, engineers from HMS Prince of Wales have assessed the aircraft, but the visiting teams have been unable to fix it so far.\nOn Thursday, the British High Commission said in a statement to the BBC: \"The UK has accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at the airport. It will be moved to the hangar once UK engineering teams arrive with specialist equipment, thereby ensuring there is minimal disruption to scheduled maintenance of other aircraft.\n\"The aircraft will return to active service once repairs and safety checks have been completed,\" it added. \"Ground teams continue to work closely with Indian authorities to ensure safety and security precautions are observed.\" \nAuthorities at Thiruvananthapuram airport told the BBC they were expecting technicians from the UK to arrive on Saturday.\nThe $110m (\u00a380m) jet is being guarded around the clock by six officers from the RAF.\nDr Sameer Patil, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai, told the BBC the Royal Navy had only two options: \"They can repair it and make it fly-worthy or they can fly it out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.\"\nThe case of the stranded jet has also been raised in the House of Commons. \nOn Monday, opposition Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty asked the government to clarify what was being done to secure it and return it to operational service, the UK Defence Journal reported. \n\"What steps are the government taking to recover the plane, how much longer will that take, and how will the government ensure the security of protected technologies on the jet while it is in the hangar and out of view?\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe British armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, confirmed the aircraft remained under close UK control.\n\"We continue to work with our Indian friends who provided first-class support when the F-35B was unable to return to the carrier,\" he said. \"I am certain that the security of the jet is in good hands because Royal Air Force crew are with it at all times.\"\nF-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability. \nSo images of the \"lonely F-35B\", parked on the tarmac and soaked by the Kerala monsoon rains, have spawned memes on social media.\nOne viral post joked that the jet had been put up for sale at an online site at a hugely competitive price of $4m. The listing claimed the jet included features like \"automatic parking, brand-new tyres, a new battery and an automatic gun to destroy traffic violators\".\nOne user on X said the jet deserved Indian citizenship as it had been in the country long enough, while another suggested that India should start charging rent and that the Kohinoor diamond would be the most appropriate payment.\nOn Wednesday, Kerala government's tourism department also joined in the fun with a post on X that said \"Kerala, the destination you'll never want to leave.\"\nThe post included an AI-generated photograph of an F-35B standing on the runway with coconut palm trees in the background. The text suggested that, like most visitors to the state described in tourism brochures as \"God's own country\" for its scenic beauty, the jet too was finding it hard to leave.\nDr Patil says that each passing day that the jet remains stranded, \"it adversely affects the image of the F-35Bs and the Royal Navy\".\n\"The jokes and memes and rumours and conspiracy theories are affecting the image and credibility of the British Royal Navy. The longer the jet stays stranded, the more disinformation will come out.\" \nThe engineering issues \"seem of a much more serious nature\" than it was originally thought, he says.\nBut most militaries, he adds, prepare for \"a worst-case scenario\" - and it is one since a jet is stranded on foreign soil. \n\"Most militaries would have a standard operating procedure [SOP] on how to respond when something like this happens. So does the Royal Navy not have an SOP?\"\nThe optics of this, he says, are really bad. \n\"If such a thing had happened in enemy territory, would they have taken this much time? This makes for very bad PR for a professional navy.\"\nAdditional reporting by Ashraf Padanna in Thiruvananthapuram",

        "article_text": "Nearly two dozen paintings by one of the world's most celebrated modern artists - once part of a record-breaking art deal - are set to hit the auction block for the first time next week.\nOn 12 June, 25 rare MF Husain paintings will go under the hammer at an art gallery in Mumbai city, more than two decades after he painted them. \nThis will be the first public glimpse of the paintings, locked away in bank vaults since 2008 after authorities seized them from a prominent businessman over an alleged loan default.\n\"It's like the paintings have come full circle,\" says Dadiba Pundole, director of Pundole Art Gallery, where the auction is set to be held.\nHusain used the gallery as his studio for many of these works, part of an ambitious 100-painting series he never finished. Often called the \"Picasso of India,\" he was one of the country's most celebrated - and controversial - artists. His works have fetched millions, but his bold themes often drew criticism. He died in 2011, aged 95.\nTitled MF Husain: An Artist's Vision of the XX Century, the 25 paintings at Pundole'a gallery offer a glimpse into his take on a transformative century shaped by leaps in technology, politics, and culture. Pundole has estimated that the auction could fetch up to $29m (\u00a321m).\nThis comes months after another Husain painting, Untitled (Gram Yatra), sold for an unprecedented $13.8m at a Christie's auction in New York, becoming the most expensive Indian artwork to be auctioned.\nThe oil-on-canvas masterpiece had adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital for almost five decades, forgotten by the art world, until the auction house was alerted about its presence in 2013.\nThe latest paintings to be auctioned seem to follow a similar trajectory.\nHusain began working on them in the early 2000s, with great excitement and vigour, recalls Pundole.\n\"When he was painting, nothing could disturb him. It didn't matter what was happening around him,\" he adds.\nIn 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessman as the first instalment of a billion-rupee deal.\nKishore Singh, author of MF Husain: The Journey of a Legend, wrote about this agreement in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\"He [Husain] wasn't jealous of fellow artists, but he was competitive,\" Singh writes, noting that Husain struck the deal soon after Tyeb Mehta's Kali [an Indian goddess] set a new record for India's most expensive painting in 2002, selling for 15 million rupees.\nHusain struck a billion rupees deal with businessman Guru Swarup Srivastava for this series of paintings. Media dubbed it \"India's biggest art deal,\" catapulting the little-known Srivastava into overnight fame as a celebrity collector.\nBut two years later, India's top crime agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), began investigating Srivastava's business, alleging he and associates had misused a loan from a government-backed agricultural body.\nThe CBI alleged Srivastava diverted the funds into real estate, mutual funds, and  Husain paintings. He and his company deny all charges; the case remains in court.\nIn 2008, a tribunal allowed the government-backed agricultural body to seize one billion rupees in assets from Srivastava, including the 25 Husain paintings.\nIn February this year, a court cleared the way for the paintings to be auctioned to recover part of the loan. And so, after years locked away in bank vaults, the 25 paintings are finally stepping into the spotlight.\nIn a 2018 interview to author and journalist Tara Kaushal, Srivastava spoke about his stalled deal with the artist.\n\"I had planned to pay Husain for the rest of the paintings by selling the first 25. But legal complications meant that, when Husain called me in 2008 saying the paintings were ready in London and Paris, and to pick them up at the agreed price, my funds were not ready. He understood,\" he said.\nAsked why Husain had chosen to sell his paintings to a person who almost nobody knew in India's elite art circles, Pundole says, \"He didn't care. As long as his paintings were sold.\"\nThere's no way to know how Husain felt about the failed deal or his unfinished 20th Century series - but the episode remains a striking footnote in his bold, eventful career. \nThe 25 paintings in this series, vibrant acrylics on canvas, showcase Husain's bold style while reflecting key 20th-century events and social attitudes. \nOne painting shows an unlikely group chatting on a bench, symbolising Husain's call for peaceful dialogue and coexistence among global powers.\nAnother painting honours Charlie Chaplin while juxtaposing a rocket launch to highlight the contrast between social and economic disparities and massive state spending.\nOther paintings depict a world battling poverty, soldiers in trenches, and humanity confronting tragedies like World War Two, the Partition, and the Holocaust.

And so, after years locked away in bank vaults, the 25 paintings are finally stepping into the spotlight.Pundole Art GalleryIn 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessmanIn a 2018 interview to author and journalist Tara Kaushal, Srivastava spoke about his stalled deal with the artist. Pundole has estimated that the auction could fetch up to $29m (\u00a321m).This comes months after another Husain painting, Untitled (Gram Yatra), sold for an unprecedented $13.8m at a Christie's auction in New York, becoming the most expensive Indian artwork to be auctioned.The oil-on-canvas masterpiece had adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital for almost five decades, forgotten by the art world, until the auction house was alerted about its presence in 2013.Pundole Art GalleryHusain sketching the outlines of a painting in the series at the Pundole Art GalleryThe latest paintings to be auctioned seem to follow a similar trajectory.Husain began working on them in the early 2000s, with great excitement and vigour, recalls Pundole. \"He [Husain] wasn't jealous of fellow artists, but he was competitive,\" Singh writes, noting that Husain struck the deal soon after Tyeb Mehta's Kali [an Indian goddess] set a new record for India's most expensive painting in 2002, selling for 15 million rupees.Husain struck a billion rupees deal with businessman Guru Swarup Srivastava for this series of paintings. It didn't matter what was happening around him,\" he adds.In 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessman as the first instalment of a billion-rupee deal.Kishore Singh, author of MF Husain: The Journey of a Legend, wrote about this agreement in the Indian Express newspaper.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India Company gradually transformed into a colonial power. \nBy the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, Company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling.\nA Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of Company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists.\nPainted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs.\n\"The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes,\" says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show.\n\"Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them,  and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met \u2013 or at least observed \u2013 multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but \u2013 as they began to discern \u2013 were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice.\"\nBeyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. \nBefore photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists.\nBeyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb.\nThe once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. \nFrom June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)\nThe largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). \nWhile Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it.\nOriginally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801.\n\"The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century,\" writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. \n\"These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected.\"\nAnother painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. \nAt the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. \nLabeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.\nBy the late 18th Century, Company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. \nArt historian Mildred Archer called them a \"fascinating record of Indian social life,\" blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. \nRegional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers.\n\"They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life,\" says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.\nMost studies of Company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. \nA striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800.\nOne painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue.\nAmong the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting  boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats.\nWith no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.\nCompany paintings often featured natural history studies, portraying birds, animals, and plants - especially from private menageries. \nAs seen in the DAG show, these subjects are typically shown life-size against plain white backgrounds, with minimal surroundings - just the occasional patch of grass. The focus remains firmly on the species itself.\nAshish Anand, CEO of DAG, says the the latest show proposes Company paintings as the \"starting point of Indian modernism\".\nAnand says this \"was the moment when Indian artists who had trained in courtly ateliers first moved outside the court (and the temple) to work for new patrons\". \n\"The agendas of those patrons were not tied up with courtly or religious concerns; they were founded on scientific enquiry and observation,\" he says. \n\"Never mind that the patrons were foreigners. What should strike us now is how Indian artists responded to their demands, creating entirely new templates of Indian art.\"",

As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "For weeks, a battle over language and identity has been raging in India's richest state, Maharashtra.\nThe row began in April after the Maharashtra government made it compulsory for state-run primary schools to teach Hindi as a third language, apart from English and Marathi (the state's dominant language). This, it said, was in line with a federal policy which mandates that children be taught three languages in school.\nThe National Education Policy (NEP), introduced in 1968, aims to promote and regulate education in India and the government updates it occasionally. The latest iteration of the policy, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government five years ago, is being implemented in stages and has run into controversy earlier. \nThe Maharashtra government's decision met fierce opposition from civil society groups, language activists and opposition leaders who accused it of trying to impose Hindi - predominantly spoken in northern and central Indian states - in the state.\nLanguage is a sensitive issue in India where many states, including Maharashtra, were formed on linguistic lines after independence. The local language is often intrinsically linked to regional pride and identity, and any change to the status quo can be perceived as a threat. For instance, last year, Kannada-language activists in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, held protests demanding that billboards be written in the local language and not just English.\nBut the uneasiness is especially high when it comes to Hindi, the most-spoken language in India. Over the years, steps by various federal governments to promote Hindi have fuelled fears within non-Hindi speaking states that the local culture will be diluted. These worries have been exacerbated by high migration from less-developed Hindi-speaking states to other parts of India, especially the south, in search of jobs.\nAbhay Deshpande, a political analyst, says that these anxieties have increased after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. Top leaders of the BJP - the party is stronger in Hindi-speaking states - have often courted controversy by making remarks about privileging Hindi.\nAs tensions rose in Maharashtra, the state government - ruled by a BJP-led coalition - revoked its decision and appointed a committee to re-examine the three-language policy. But the controversy refuses to die down.\nThe row comes months ahead of the long-overdue municipal polls which are set to be held in the state, including in Mumbai city, home to India's richest municipal corporation. It has sparked a political slugfest between the ruling coalition and opposition parties, with each side accusing the other of playing political games. \nThere have also been reports of violence against non-Marathi speakers in the state.\nIn April, two women in Thane district were allegedly assaulted in their residential complex after they said \"excuse me\" to a man who insisted they speak to him in Marathi.\nThe same month, a security guard in Mumbai was allegedly beaten up by workers from the opposition Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) - a nativist party known for its aggressive brand of politics - after he said that he did not know Marathi.\nIn May, a couple in Mumbai reportedly refused to pay a delivery agent after he declined to speak in Marathi. Last week, a shocking video showing a shop owner being assaulted, allegedly by MNS workers, for not speaking Marathi went viral on social media, sparking outrage.\nWhile the issue seems to have increased societal divisions, it has also brought together two political rivals almost two decades after they parted ways.\nLast week, Uddhav Thackeray, chief of the local opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party and Raj Thackeray, leader of the MNS - the son and nephew, respectively, of Bal Thackeray, patriarch of the erstwhile Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party that gained popularity in Maharashtra in the 1960s with its nativist politics - held a joint rally to oppose alleged Hindi imposition.\nWhile the strength of the truce remains to be seen, experts say that the optics of the cousins putting aside differences to \"protect Marathi pride\" could help their prospects in the upcoming municipal elections.\n\"The issue of Marathi language and culture is close to peoples' hearts,\" says Prashant Dixit, a former political journalist who has reported on the state for over two decades. \"It is an emotive issue, especially for people living in Mumbai, and it has been so since the 1960s,\" he adds.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the erstwhile Shiv Sena, under the leadership of Bal Thackeray, conducted aggressive campaigns against people who had migrated to Mumbai from southern states, accusing them of taking up jobs that should have gone to locals.\nIn the decades after that, migration patterns changed and the party turned its ire towards people from northern states who were migrating to the city in search of economic opportunities. The party blamed migrants from states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for taking away jobs. \nThese tensions look set to continue. According to data from India's last census, there was a 40% increase in Mumbai city's Hindi-speaking population between 2001 and 2011.\nThese Marathi-centric agitations have earlier resonated with voters, especially in Mumbai, and some believe that it could help the Thackeray cousins in the municipal elections as well.  \nHowever, many have criticised this approach.\nAn editorial in the Indian Express newspaper titled 'Slap In Mumbai's Face' argued that politics centred around linguistic identity was \"deeply troubling\" and that its parochialism lent itself to violence, something that \"should have no place in India's most industrialised state\". \nMr Dixit agrees - he thinks that any support garnered by aggressive language agitations is likely to be short-lived. \n\"People want their leaders to deliver on their promises and focus on real progress, in the form of better jobs and policies, so that life is better for everyone,\" he says.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

The figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.But it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.The Trustees of the British MuseumJain religious art focuses on representations of the 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.The exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India.",

        "article_text": "One of the engines of the Air India plane that crashed last week was new, while the other was not due for servicing until December, the airline's chairman has said.\nIn an interview with an Indian news channel, N Chandrasekaran said that both engines of the aircraft had \"clean\" histories.\n\"The right engine was a new engine put in March 2025. The left engine was last serviced in 2023 and due for its next maintenance check in December 2025,\" he told Times Now channel. \nAt least 270 people, most of them passengers, were killed last Thursday when AI171, a London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in western India.\nInvestigators are now sifting through debris and decoding recorded flight data and cockpit audio - from the aircraft's black boxes which have been found - to deconstruct the flight's final moments and determine the cause of the incident.\n\"There are a lot of speculations and a lot of theories. But the fact that I know so far is this particular aircraft, this specific tail, AI171, has a clean history,\" Mr Chandrasekaran said, cautioning people against jumping to conclusions.\n\"I am told by all the experts that the black box and recorders will definitely tell the story. So, we just have to wait for that,\" he added.\nKishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, told the BBC that the condition of an aircraft engine is not necessarily linked to its age - particularly in the case of the Genx-1B engines used on the Boeing 787-8.\n\"The age of the engine has no bearing on the health of the engine, especially for the Genx-1B engines,\" Mr Chinta said. In other words just because an engine is new, does not necessarily mean it is healthy, or vice versa. \nUnlike older models, the Genx-1B engines, which are made by GE Aerospace, don't follow a fixed overhaul or maintenance schedule. Instead, they are equipped with a system called the Full Authority Digital Engine Control or FADEC that continuously monitors engine health and performance. The decision to service or replace the engine is based on this data and physical inspections.\nHowever, Mr Chinta pointed out that certain components of the engine, known as Life Limited Parts (LLPs), still have a fixed lifespan typically between 15,000 and 20,000 cycles.\n\"Every start and switch-off of the engine counts as one cycle,\" he explained.\nWhile the investigation continues, Air India has also announced a 15% cut in its international operations on wide-body aircraft until mid-July as it grapples with the fallout from the crash.\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the decision was driven by \"compounding circumstances\" - including enhanced safety checks, increased caution by crew and ground staff and tensions in the Middle East.\nSeparately, the airline said that inspections have been completed on 26 of its 33 Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft, all of which have been \"cleared for service\". \nIndia's aviation regulator had ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet after the deadly crash as a \"preventive measure\".\nThe remaining aircraft are expected to be examined in the coming days, Air India said, adding that the airline's Boeing 777 fleet would also \"undertake enhanced safety checks\".\n\"The curtailments are a painful measure to take, but are necessary following a devastating event which we are still working through and an unusual combination of external events,\" it said. \nMeanwhile some experts say the crash will likely have an impact on Air India as it tries to transform from a troubled state-owned carrier to a privately-owned company. \nTata Sons, a conglomerate which also owns big brands like Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover, brought the airline - formerly India's national carrier - from the Indian government in 2022. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "In the winter of 1956, The Times correspondent David Holden arrived on the island of Bahrain, then still a British protectorate. \nAfter a short-lived career teaching geography, Holden had looked forward to his Arabian posting, but he hadn't expected to be attending a garden durbar in honour of Queen Victoria's appointment as Empress of India. \nEverywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India. \n\"The Raj maintains here a slightly phantasmal sway,\" wrote Holden, \"a situation rich in anomaly and anachronism\u2026 The servants are all bearers, the laundryman a dhobi, and the watchman a chowkidar,\" he wrote, \"and on Sundays the guests are confronted with the ancient, and agreeable, Anglo-Indian ritual of a mountainous curry lunch.\" \nThe Sultan of Oman, educated in Rajasthan, was more fluent in Urdu than Arabic, while soldiers in the nearby state of Qu'aiti, now eastern Yemen, marched around in now-defunct Hyderabadi army uniforms.\nIn the words of the governor of Aden himself: \n\"One had an extraordinarily powerful impression that all the clocks here had stopped seventy years ago; that the Raj was at its height, Victoria on the throne, Gilbert and Sullivan a fresh and revolutionary phenomenon, and Kipling a dangerous debunker, so strong was the link from Delhi via Hyderabad to the South Arabian shore.\"\nAlthough largely forgotten today, in the early 20th Century, nearly a third of the Arabian Peninsula was ruled as part of the British Indian Empire. \nFrom Aden to Kuwait, a crescent of Arabian protectorates was governed from Delhi, overseen by the Indian Political Service, policed by Indian troops, and answerable to the Viceroy of India.\nUnder the Interpretation Act of 1889, these protectorates had all legally been considered part of India. \nThe standard list of India's semi-independent princely states like Jaipur opened alphabetically with Abu Dhabi, and the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, even suggested that Oman should be treated \"as much a Native State of the Indian Empire as Lus Beyla or Kelat [present day Balochistan]\". \nIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern Yemen, which functioned as India's westernmost port and was administered as part of Bombay Province. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1931, he found many young Arabs identifying as Indian nationalists.\nEven at the time, however, few members of the British or Indian public were aware of this Arabian extension of the British Raj. \nMaps showing the full reach of the Indian Empire were only published in top secrecy, and the Arabian territories were left off public documents to avoid provoking the Ottomans or later the Saudis. \nIndeed, as one Royal Asiatic Society lecturer quipped:\n\"As a jealous sheikh veils his favourite wife, so the British authorities shroud conditions in the Arab states in such thick mystery that ill-disposed propagandists might almost be excused for thinking that something dreadful is going on there.\"\nBut by the 1920s, politics was shifting. Indian nationalists began to imagine India not as an imperial construct but as a cultural space rooted in the geography of the Mahabharata. London saw an opportunity to redraw borders. On 1 April 1937, the first of several imperial partitions was enacted and Aden was separated from India. \nA telegram from King George VI was read aloud:\n\"Aden has been an integral part of British Indian administration for nearly 100 years. That political association with my Indian Empire will now be broken, and Aden will take its place in my Colonial Empire.\"\nThe Gulf remained under the purview of the Government of India for another decade, however. \nBritish officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India.\"\nAs Gulf resident William Hay put it, \"it would clearly have been inappropriate to hand over responsibility for dealing with the Gulf Arabs to Indians or Pakistanis\". \nThe Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.\nMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. \nFew batted an eyelid, and 75 years on, the importance of what had just happened is still not fully understood in either India or the Gulf. \nWithout this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.\nWhen British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. So Britain retained its role in the Gulf for 24 more years, with an 'Arabian Raj' now reporting to Whitehall rather than to the Viceroy of India. \nIn the words of Gulf scholar Paul Rich, this was \"the Indian Empire's last redoubt, just as Goa was Portuguese India's last solitary vestige, or Pondicherry was the tag-end of French India\".\nThe official currency was still the Indian rupee; the easiest mode of transport was still the 'British India Line' (shipping company) and the 30 Arabian princely states were still governed by 'British residents' who had made their careers in the Indian Political Service.\nThe British only finally pulled out of the Gulf in 1971 as part of its decision to abandon colonial commitments east of Suez. \nAs David Holden wrote in July: \n\"For the first time since the heyday of Britain's East India Company, all the territories around the Gulf will be at liberty to seek their own salvation without the threat of British intervention, or the comfort of British protection. This final remnant of the British Raj - for that, in effect, is what it is \u2013 has been for some years now an obvious, if in some ways charming, anachronism \u2026 But its day is over.\"\nOf all the national narratives that emerged after the Empire's collapse, the Gulf states have been most successful at erasing their ties to British India. \nFrom Bahrain to Dubai, a past relationship with Britain is remembered, but governance from Delhi is not. The myth of an ancient sovereignty is crucial to keeping the monarchies alive. Yet private memories persist, particularly of the unimaginable class reversal that the Gulf has seen. \nIn 2009, Gulf scholar Paul Rich recorded an elderly Qatari gentleman who \"still got angry when he related to me the beating he received when as a young boy of seven or eight he stole an orange, a fruit which he had never seen before, from an Indian employee of the British agent\". \n\"The Indians, he said, were a privileged caste during his youth, and it gave him immense pleasure that the tables had turned and they now came to the Gulf as servants.\"\nToday Dubai, once a minor outpost of the Indian Empire with no gun salute, is the glittering centre of the new Middle East. \nFew of the millions of Indians or Pakistanis who live there know that there was a world in which India or Pakistan might have inherited the oil-rich Gulf, just as they did Jaipur, Hyderabad or Bahawalpur. \nA quiet bureaucratic decision, made in the twilight of empire, severed that link. Today, only the echoes remain.\nSam Dalrymple is the author of Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia",

The Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.Sam DalrympleIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern YemenMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. Without this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.When British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. British officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India. Everywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India.",

        "article_text": "A young and untested Indian Test side, led by debutant captain Shubman Gill, begins its toughest examination yet this week: a five-match series in England, starting at Headingley. \nIt marks the start of the fourth World Test Championship (WTC) cycle and the first contest for the newly renamed Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, promising both rich drama and formidable challenges.\nEngland have never made a WTC final. India reached the first two but lost - to New Zealand in 2021 and Australia in 2023. A winning start would lift either side's new campaign.\nIndia thrashed England 4-1 in their last meeting, but that was on spin-friendly pitches at home. In England, seaming conditions will test adaptability, technique and mental grit - especially for the batters.\nEngland's Bazball era - led by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum - divides opinion, but the results are harder to argue with: since 2022, they haven't lost a home series and have won a majority of their Tests.\nIn contrast, past records - compounded by recent form, retirements, injuries and fitness concerns - make this a daunting challenge for India.\nSince their Test debut at Lord's in 1932, they've toured England 18 times but won only three series - 1971, 1986 and 2007 - while suffering four whitewashes. \nThe historical imbalance is amplified by recent form: India have lost six of their last eight Tests, missing out on the WTC final and losing stalwarts R Ashwin, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to sudden retirements. \nAshwin exited mid-series in Australia last November. Sharma and Kohli announced their retirements just before the England tour squad was picked. To make matters worse, pace spearhead Mohammed Shami was ruled out, with BCCI doctors yet to clear him for red-ball cricket after surgery and rehab.\nThis leaves India without four high-impact players who shaped a golden era in Test cricket, even if it didn't bring WTC silverware. Sharma's departure also forced a leadership transition.\nEnter Shubman Gill. His appointment - over vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah - came after intense internal debate. Bumrah reportedly wasn't confident he could play all five Tests in a packed English summer.\nBumrah's fitness is now the biggest concern. At full tilt, he's arguably the world's best fast bowler, a player who can tilt matches single-handedly. But any interruptions to his bowling - due to workload or injury - could throw India's balance off-kilter.\nIndia's pace bench has depth - Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Prasidh Krishna, Arshdeep Singh and Nitish Reddy - but none match Bumrah's aura. In spin, the Jadeja-Kuldeep duo is backed by Washington Sundar's promise.\nBatting is more uncertain. \nWith Rohit and Kohli gone - they had190 Tests between them -  India faces not dents but gaping holes in experience. \nYashasvi Jaiswal has emerged as the brightest batting hope, and KL Rahul remains a capable match-winner. \nProlific run-making in domestic cricket has earned Sai Sudharsan and Abhimanyu Easwaran spots in the squad and and Karun Nair a recall to international cricket. \nAll of them are tipped to find places in the top order. But for India's batting to show match-winning heft, runs from the bats of Rishabh Pant, and - even more - Gill himself, are paramount.\nCaptaincy in Test cricket brings not just immense power but also scrutiny. Gill will be judged not only on performance but also how he leads and inspires a transitioning side. Coach Gautam Gambhir, too, is under pressure, following big defeats last season to New Zealand and Australia.\nIndian cricket stands at an inflection point. Gill leads a team in flux. The path ahead is steep, but not uncharted. \nIn 1971, India faced a similar crossroads. \nThen chairman of selectors Vijay Merchant, intent on rejuvenating Indian cricket, ushered in sweeping changes - using his casting vote to replace Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi with Ajit Wadekar as captain for the twin tours of the West Indies and England.\nIndia went on to win the first time ever in both countries, to make it an Indian Summer. Gill now has a chance to script a sequel.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "\"My neighbours thought I'd lost my mind,\" says farmer Kakasaheb Sawant.\nIn 2022 he had decided to plant some apple trees, not crazy for a farmer unless, like Mr Sawant, you live in subtropical southern India, where temperatures can hit 43C.\nHe bought 100 saplings, of which 80 survived. Last year each tree produced between 30 and 40 kilogrammes of fruit.\n\"My farm has become something of a local miracle. People travel from far-off places just to see the apple trees growing under the hot Maharashtra sun.\"\nIt's not been an unqualified success though. One problem is that the apples are not sweet enough to sell.\nMr Sawant remains enthusiastic. He's had some success selling apple tree saplings and is optimistic about future harvests.\n\"This is the beginning. The trees are getting acclimatised so according to me in next four to five years these trees will start bearing good, sweet apples.\"\nIn his own small way, Mr Sawant is hoping to meet India's rising demand for apples. \nProduction has risen 15% over the last five years to 2.5 million tonnes.\nBut that is not keeping up with demand and India's imports have roughly doubled to 600,000 tonnes over the same period, according to S Chandrashekhar, who analyses India's apple trade. \n\"We do have a shortage of apple production,\" he says. \"There are not many new players... at the same time, and there is no new investment.\"\nEssential for a good apple crop is a lengthy period of winter temperature between 0C and 6C.\nCountries like the UK, with around 1,000 hours of this chill-time, can produce almost any apple variety.\nBut in India areas with those conditions are more limited. \nMost of India's apples come from two regions in the north of the country -Jammu and Kashmir and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh.\nMr Chandrashekhar says that many farms in those regions are becoming less productive. \n\"There are lot of old orchards producing fewer apples - that means the yield is coming down,\" he says.\nHe says that climate change is making conditions less favourable.\n\nIn the hope of expanding apple production into new areas, some scientists and farmers are experimenting with so-called low-chill varieties.\nThose are apple trees that can produce crops with around 400 hours of temperatures between 0C and 6C.\nRanchi, eastern India is also not an apple growing region - its subtropical climate is too hot. \nBut researchers at the Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) are testing 18 saplings of three low-chill varieties.\nSuccess has been limited so far -  only one of the varieties has produced any fruit. \n\"The plants have not reached optimal sizes. The tree has given us only around one to two kilogrammes of apples in 2024.  I would not say that they are of best quality, but they were edible,\" says Dr Majid Ali. \nHe says that as well as an unfavourable climate, the local soil is not ideal for apple trees and the trees get attacked by termites.\n\"This is an experimental stage. To reach a conclusion it would take three to four years to say if it is successful.\"\nHe says that some local farmers have also been experimenting with low-chill apple varieties, also with little success. \nSome are sceptical that apples cultivated in hot areas will ever be a commercial proposition. \n\"The fruit that grows in non-traditional regions has a very short shelf life. The taste is not so sweet,\" says Dr Dinesh Thakur, associate director of a regional horticulture research and training centre at Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry.\n\"These low-chill apples can be grown as novelty fruit in a kitchen garden, but their viability as a commercial crop is not proven... most of them are a failure,\" he says. \nDr Thakur is based in the traditional northern apple growing region of Himachal Pradesh and his research focuses on the improvement of apples through breeding.\n\"Climatic change is creating havoc in apple cultivation,\" he says. \nHe says the number of those crucial chilling hours are falling and due to erratic weather conditions farmers are facing colossal financial losses every year. \nIn search of better conditions, some orchards are being planted in higher locations, which were once considered too cold, he says.\nUnder a government sponsored project his team are experimenting with 300 varieties of apples, to assess the impact of climate change.\n\"We are also working on climate-resilient apple genotypes that can withstand the existing climate,\" he says.\nSo far, they have developed an apple that matures with a ripe colour two months earlier than existing apple trees. \n\"This helps offset erratic weather patterns brought by climate change and has a quality advantage over those areas where  colour formation is problem due to lack of sunlight,\" Dr Thakur says. \n\"This is just the beginning of research to create climate resilient fruit and create a fruit that is acceptable to the Indian taste bud.\"\nFor Mr Chandrashekhar, boosting India's apple output will take more than just scientific work. \n\"Apple orchards in the traditional apple cultivation areas are 15 to 20 years old. What is needed is replanting of new saplings,\" he says.\n\"The industry needs investment, huge investment. Who will do that?\" he asks.\nHe would like to see the juice and jam business developed, to provide the industry with another source of income. \n\"That has to be a booster which can improve the apple economy and provide a better position for apple growers.\"",

        "article_text": "\"It's unfair to lift censorship suddenly,\" growls a grizzled newspaper editor into the phone, a copy of The Daily Pulp sprawled across his desk. \"We should be given time to prepare our minds.\"\nThe cartoon capturing this moment - piercing and satirical - is the work of Abu Abraham, one of India's finest political cartoonists. His pen skewered power with elegance and edge, especially during the 1975 Emergency, a 21-month stretch of suspended civil liberties and muzzled media under Indira Gandhi's rule.\nThe press was silenced overnight on 25 June. Delhi's newspaper presses lost power, and by morning censorship was law. The government demanded the press bend to its will - and, as opposition leader LK Advani later famously remarked, many \"chose to crawl\". \nAnother famous cartoon -  he signed them Abu, after his pen name - from that time shows a man asking another: \"What do you think of editors who are more loyal than the censor?\"\nIn many ways, half a century later, Abu's cartoons still ring true.  \nIndia currently ranks 151st in the World Press Freedom Index, compiled annually by Reporters Without Borders. This reflects growing concerns about media independence under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Critics allege increasing pressure and attacks on journalists, acquiescent media and a shrinking space for dissenting voices. The government dismisses these claims, insisting that the media remain free and vibrant. \nAfter nearly 15 years drawing cartoons in London for The Observer and The Guardian, Abu had returned to India in the late 1960s. He joined the Indian Express newspaper as a political cartoonist at a time when the country was grappling with intense political upheaval.\nHe later wrote that pre-censorship - which required newspapers and magazines to submit their news reports, editorials and even ads to government censors before publication - began two days after the Emergency was declared, was lifted after a few weeks, then reimposed a year later for a shorter period.\n\"For the rest of the time I had no official interference. I have not bothered to investigate why I was allowed to carry on freely. And I am not interested in finding out.\"\nMany of Abu's Emergency-era cartoons are iconic. One shows then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed signing the proclamation from his bathtub, capturing the haste and casualness with which it was issued (Ahmed signed the Emergency declaration that Gandhi had issued shortly before midnight on 25 June).\nAmong Abu's striking works are several cartoons boldly stamped with \"Not passed by censors\", a stark mark of official suppression.\nIn one, a man holds a placard that reads \"Smile!\" - a sly jab at the government's forced-positivity campaigns during the Emergency. His companion deadpans, \"Don't you think we have a lovely censor of humour?\" - a line that cuts to the heart of state-enforced cheer.\nAnother seemingly innocuous cartoon shows a man at his desk sighing, \"My train of thought has derailed.\" Another features a protester carrying a sign that reads \"SaveD democracy\" - the \"D\" awkwardly added on top, as if democracy itself were an afterthought.\nAbu also took aim at Sanjay Gandhi, the unelected son of Indira Gandhi, who many believed ran a shadow government during the Emergency, wielding unchecked power behind the scenes. Sanjay's influence was both controversial and feared. He died in a plane crash in 1980 - four years before his mother, Indira, was assassinated by her bodyguards.\nAbu's work was intensely political. \"I have come to the conclusion that there's nothing non-political in the world. Politics is simply anything that is controversial and everything in the world is controversial,\" he wrote in Seminar magazine in 1976.\nHe also bemoaned the state of humour - strained and manufactured - when the press was gagged.\n\"If cheap humour could be manufactured in a factory, the public would rush to queue up in our ration shops all day. As our newspapers become progressively duller, the reader, drowning in boredom, clutches at every joke. AIR [India's state-run radio station] news bulletins nowadays sound like a company chairman's annual address. Profits are carefully and elaborately enumerated, losses are either omitted or played down. Shareholders are reassured,\" Abu wrote.\nIn a tongue-in-cheek column for the Sunday Standard in 1977, Abu poked fun at the culture of political flattery with a fictional account of a meeting of the \"All India Sycophantic Society\".\nThe spoof featured the society's imaginary president declaring: \"True sycophancy is non-political.\" \nThe satirical monologue continued with mock proclamations: \"Sycophancy has a long and historic tradition in our country\u2026 'Servility before self' is our motto.\" \nAbu's parody culminated in the society's guiding vision: \"Touching all available feet and promoting a broad-based programme of flattery.\"\nBorn as Attupurathu Mathew Abraham in the southern state of Kerala in 1924, Abu began his career as a reporter at the nationalist Bombay Chronicle, driven less by ideology than a fascination with the power of the printed word. \nHis reporting years coincided with India's dramatic journey to independence, witnessing firsthand the euphoria that gripped Bombay (now Mumbai). Reflecting on the press, he later noted, \"The press has pretensions of being a crusader but is more often a preserver of the status quo.\"\nAfter two years with Shankar's Weekly, a well-known satire magazine, Abu set his sights on Europe. A chance encounter with British cartoonist Fred Joss in 1953 propelled him to London, where he quickly made a mark.\nHis debut cartoon was accepted by Punch within a week of arrival, earning praise from editor Malcolm Muggeridge as \"charming\".\nFreelancing for two years in London's competitive scene, Abu's political cartoons began appearing in Tribune and soon attracted the attention of The Observer's editor David Astor.\nAstor offered him a staff position with the paper.\n\"You are not cruel like other cartoonists, and your work is the kind I was looking for,\" he told Abu.\nIn 1956, at Astor's suggestion, Abraham adopted the pen name \"Abu\", writing later: \"He explained that any Abraham in Europe would be taken as a Jew and my cartoons would take on slant for no reason, and I wasn't even Jewish.\"\nAstor also assured him of creative freedom: \"You will never be asked to draw a political cartoon expressing ideas which you do not yourself personally sympathise.\"\nAbu worked at The Observer for 10 years, followed by three years at The Guardian, before returning to India in the late 1960s.

In 1981, he launched Salt and Pepper, a comic strip that ran for nearly two decades, blending gentle satire with everyday observations. He returned to Kerala in 1988 and continued to draw and write until his death in 2002.\nBut Abu's legacy was never just about the punchline - it was about the deeper truths his humour revealed. \nAs he once remarked, \"If anyone has noticed a decline in laughter, the reason may not be the fear of laughing at authority but the feeling that reality and fancy, tragedy and comedy have all, somehow got mixed up.\"\nThat blurring of absurdity and truth often gave his work its edge. \n\"The prize for the joke of the year,\" he wrote during the Emergency, \"should go to the Indian news agency reporter in London who approvingly quoted a British newspaper comment on India under the Emergency, that 'trains are running on time' - not realising this used to be the standard English joke about Mussolini's Italy.

        "article_text": "Less than 40 seconds.\nThat's how long Air India Flight 171 was airborne before it plunged into a densely populated neighbourhood in Ahmedabad in one of India's most baffling aviation disasters in recent memory.\nInvestigators now face the grim task of sifting through the wreckage and decoding the cockpit voice and flight data recorders of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to piece together what went catastrophically wrong in the seconds after take-off. Under international rules set by the UN aviation body ICAO, a preliminary investigation report should be released within 30 days, with the final report ideally completed within 12 months.\nThe London Gatwick-bound aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar, lifted off from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT) on Thursday, with 242 people and nearly 100 tonnes of fuel on board. Within moments, a mayday call crackled from the cockpit. It would be the last transmission. This was followed by a loss of altitude and a crash engulfed in flames.\nCaptain Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), calls this \"the rarest of the rare\" crashes - a controlled flight into terrain just 30 seconds after take-off. \"To my knowledge, nothing quite like this has ever happened,\" he told the BBC.\nDid both engines fail due to bird strikes or fuel contamination? Were the flaps improperly extended, reducing lift on a heavily loaded jet in extreme heat? Was there a maintenance error during engine servicing? Or did an inadvertent crew action cut off fuel to both engines?\nInvestigators will be probing all these possibilities - and more. Air crash investigations rely on triangulation and elimination - matching physical evidence from the wreckage with recorded aircraft performance data to build a coherent picture of what went wrong.\nEvery scorched cable, damaged turbine blade, aeroplane maintenance log, and signals and sounds from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders - the so-called \"black box\" - will be examined. The BBC spoke to accident experts to understand how the investigation will proceed.\nCritically, the first clues on the ground may come from the wreckage of the two engines, at least three investigators said.\n\"You can tell from the damage whether the engines were generating power at impact - turbines fracture differently when spinning at high speed,\" says Peter Goelz, a former managing director of US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). \"That's the first clue to what went wrong.\" \nTurbines are crucial rotating components that play a key role in extracting energy to generate thrust.\n\"If the engines weren't producing power, investigators have a serious case on their hands - and the focus will shift sharply to the cockpit.\"\nWhat happened in the cockpit will be revealed by the Boeing 787's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or the \"black boxes\" - which, investigators say, will help tell the story. (Indian officials say the recorders have been recovered from the crash site.)\nThese devices capture extensive flight data and cockpit audio - from pilot radio calls to ambient cockpit sounds. Voice recordings come from individual pilot mics, radio transmissions and an area microphone that picks up background noise in the cockpit.\nData recorders track with high precision the position of gear and flap levers, thrust settings, engine performance, fuel flow and even fire handle activation. \n\"If the flight data recorder shows the engines were making full power, then the attention will move to the flaps and slats. If they are found to be extended as needed, then it becomes a very difficult investigation,\" says Mr Goelz. \nFlaps and slats increase lift at lower speeds, helping an aircraft take off and land safely by allowing it to fly slower without stalling.\n\"If [the trail leads] to a problem in the flight management control system, that would raise serious concerns - not just for Boeing, but for the entire aviation industry.\"\nThe Boeing 787's flight management control system is a highly automated suite that manages navigation, performance and guidance. It integrates data from a number of sensors to optimise the aircraft's flight path and fuel efficiency.\nWith over 1,100 Boeing 787s flying worldwide since 2011, investigators must determine whether this was a systemic issue that could affect the global fleet - or a one-off failure unique to this flight, experts say. \"If it points to a system problem, then the regulatory bodies have to make some tough decisions very quickly,\" says Mr Goelz.\nSo far, there is no indication of fault on anyone's part. India's civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday that a recent inspection of Air India's Boeing 787 fleet - 24 of 33 aircraft have been checked so far - \"did not reveal any major safety concern,\" adding that the planes and maintenance systems complied with existing standards.\nBoeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said on 12 June:  \"Boeing will defer to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) for information on Air India Flight 171, in line with UN ICAO protocol.\"\nDecoding of the data at the AAIB lab in Delhi will be led by Indian investigators, with experts from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India and Indian regulators. Investigators from the NTSB and UK will also be participating.\n\"In my experience, teams can usually determine what happened fairly quickly,\" Mr Goelz says. \"But understanding why it happened can take much longer.\"\nThe wreckage may yield other clues. \"Every part - wire, nut, bolt - will be meticulously collected,\" says Mr Chinta. \nTypically, wreckage is moved to a nearby hangar or secure facility, laid out to identify the nose, tail and wingtips, and then pieced together. In this case, depending on what the flight data and voice recorders reveal, a full reconstruction may not be necessary, investigators say.\nThe importance of wreckage varies by accident, say investigators. For Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, it was crucial -  reconstruction of the nose revealed clear shrapnel damage from a Russia-made missile.\nIn the wreckage, investigators will also examine fuel filters, lines, valves and residual fuel to check for contamination - something that's easy to detect or rule out, a crash investigator who preferred to remain unnamed, said. Also, he believed that the refuelling equipment used before departure \"has likely been quarantined and already inspected\".\nThat's not all. Investigators will gather maintenance and fault history records from the airline and Boeing's ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting system) which transmits data via radio or satellite to both Boeing and Air India, says Mr Chinta.\nThey will review all flights operated by the aircraft and the crew over recent months, along with the technical log of pilot-reported faults and corrective actions taken before release of aircraft to service.\nInvestigators will also examine pilot licences, training records, simulator performance and instructor remarks - including how pilots handled scenarios like engine failures in advanced flight simulators. \"I reckon Air India would have already provided these records to the investigation team,\" says Mr Chinta.\nInvestigators will review the service history of all components of the aircraft that were removed and replaced, examining reported defects for any recurring issues - or signs of problems that could have affected this flight.\n\"These investigations are extraordinarily complex. They take time, but there will be early indicators of what likely went wrong,\" says Mr Goelz.\nA big reason is how far technology has come. \"One of the first accidents I investigated in 1994 had a flight data recorder tracking just four parameters,\" he says.\n\"Today's recorders capture hundreds - if not thousands - every second. That alone has transformed the way we investigate crashes.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "An Air India passenger plane bound for London's Gatwick airport crashed shortly after taking off in Ahmedabad, western India, on 12 June, killing 260 people.\nThe crash killed 242 people on board the flight and 19 others on the ground, with only one survivor from the plane.\nA preliminary report into the investigation, published on 12 July in India, found that just seconds after take-off, fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. \nThe circumstances around how or why that happened remain unclear. Here is what we know so far.\n\nAir India flight AI171 left Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport just before 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT) on Thursday 12 June, Air India said.\nIt was scheduled to land at London Gatwick at 18:25 BST.\nThe flight was airborne for less than 40 seconds. One of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane crashed in a crowded neighbourhood.\nThe plane plummeted into a building used as doctors' accommodation at the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical College and Civil Hospital, causing an explosion. It was lunch break at the hostel when parts of the aircraft crashed through the roof of the dining hall. \nThe Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data 50 seconds in, per Flightradar24.\nFuel to the engines of the Air India plane involved in a deadly crash was cut off moments after take-off, a preliminary report by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has found.\nIn recovered cockpit voice recordings, the report said one of the pilots can be heard asking \"why did you cut off?\" - to which the other pilot replied he \"did not do so\".\nThe Gatwick-bound plane was being piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar. The report does not specify which voice is which.\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, both of the plane's fuel control switches moved from the run to the cut-off position in the space of a second, shortly after take-off.\nThe switches are usually only cut off to turn off the engines after landing, or during emergency situations such as an engine fire - rather than during take-off.\nThe cut-off caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report said.\nThe fuel switches then moved back into their normal in-flight position, automatically starting the process of relighting the engines. One engine, the report said, was able to regain thrust - but could not reverse the plane's deceleration.\nOne of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane crashed into the doctors' accommodation.\nThe report said that \"no significant bird activity\" was observed in the vicinity of the plane's flight path. \nThe report also said: \"At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers\".\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin in 2019 highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged, the report said.\nThe issue was not deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation.\nThe same switch design is used in Air India's VT-ANB aircraft which crashed. As the bulletin was advisory, Air India did not perform inspections.\nThere had been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB, the report said.\nAn investigation led by AAIB - with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - is in progress. \nA final, more detailed report is expected in 12 months.\nAn Air India spokesperson said the airline acknowledged receipt of the preliminary report.\n\"We continue to fully co-operate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB,\" the Air India spokesperson added.\nThe crash is a major setback for Air India, which is in the middle of a business turnaround following its privatisation. It was bought out by the Tata Group from the Indian government in 2022.\nThe airline has announced a cut in international operations on its wide-body aircraft as it grapples with several disruptions in the aftermath of the crash.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it would defer to AAIB to provide information about the crashed plane, in adherence with protocol under the UN International Civil Aviation Organization. It also said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board in a statement thanked Indian officials for their co-operation and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing-787 jets or the GE engines.\nAir India confirmed there were 242 passengers and crew members on board the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which has a total of 256 seats.\nThere were 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals, one Canadian and 12 crew on the plane.\n\"I still cannot believe how I made it out alive,\" the sole survivor of the crash, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was sat in seat 11A, told India's state broadcaster DD News.\n\"At first, I thought I was going to die. I managed to open my eyes, unfastened my seat belt and tried to exit the plane.\"\nMr Ramesh said the side of the plane that he was sitting on did not hit the hostel and was closer to the ground floor. \"My door broke down and I saw a small space,\" he said. \"I tried to get out of the plane.\"\nHis brother Ajay was also on the plane but did not survive the crash.\nThe Foreign Office has been in contact with Mr Ramesh \"to offer consular support\", Downing Street said.\nThe aircraft involved was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. \nThe model was launched 14 years ago. Earlier this year, Boeing lauded the fact that it had reached the milestone of carrying one billion passengers.\nAir India operates a fleet of more than 190 planes including 58 Boeing aircraft, according to its website.\nThe crashed 787 Dreamliner was 11 years old and had completed more than 700 flights in the year leading up to the disaster, Flightradar24 data showed. \nAfter the crash, India's aviation regulator ordered safety checks on the airline's entire Boeing-787 fleet.\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation also announced that from 15 June one-time checks of take-off parameters will be implemented for every departure of a Boeing 787-7 or 787-9 plane. Power assurance checks have also been implemented.\nYou can also get in touch by following this link",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "A black box has been found at the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India's civil aviation minister said on Friday. \nThe flight data recorder was recovered within 28 hours by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu confirmed. \nAll but one of the 242 people on the London-bound flight died when it crashed into a residential area less than 60 seconds after take-off on Thursday. An official told the BBC that at least eight people on the ground were also killed.\n\"The [recovery of the black box] marks an important step forward in the investigation\" and will \"significantly aid the inquiry\" into the disaster, Mr Kinjarapu said.\nPlanes usually carry two black boxes - small but tough electronic data recorders. \nOne records flight data, such as altitude and speed. The other records sound from the cockpit, so investigators can hear what the pilots are saying and listen for any unusual noises.\nAAIB is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and UK. Boeing's chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said the company was supporting the investigation. \nAir India said there were 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft when it crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT).\nFlight AI171 was scheduled to land at London's Gatwick Airport at 18:25 BST.\nOn Friday, the wreckage was still scattered across the crash site, including the blackened wing of the plane, with large pieces of the aircraft stuck in buildings.\nInvestigators arrived at the scene and crowds were moved further away from the wreckage. \nA doctor told the BBC that they are relying on DNA from relatives to identify the victims. A police official at the post-mortem room told the BBC that the remains of six people had been released to families so far, as their relatives were able to identify them based on facial features.\nThe sole survivor of the crash, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A on the flight, is still recovering in hospital. \n\"I still cannot believe how I made it out alive,\" he told India's state broadcaster DD News on Thursday.\n\"At first, I thought I was going to die. I managed to open my eyes, unfastened my seat belt and tried to exit the plane.\"\nMr Ramesh, 40, who sustained burn injuries on his left hand, said he saw the aircraft crew and its passengers die in front of his eyes.\nMeanwhile, desperate families are still waiting for news of their relatives. \nImtiaz Ali, whose brother Javed and his family were on the flight, said that until he sees his brother's body, he will not believe he has died.\n\"If I get sad and start crying, then I'll be uncontrollable,\" he told the BBC. \n\"No-one will be able to stop me... my heart might burst.\" \nThe plane crashed in a residential area called Meghani Nagar and, even though it had just taken off, the impact was severe. Wreckage spread over 200m (656ft), according to responders. \nIt is still unclear exactly how many were killed on the ground, but the BBC has been told that at least eight people, who were not on the aircraft, have died. \nDr Minakshi Parikh, the dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, said four of their students died as the plane crashed into buildings on the campus.\n\"There were also four relatives of our doctors who were on the campus when the aircraft crashed - they too were killed,\" Dr Parikh said.\n\"We are relying only on DNA matching to identify them and it is something where we simply cannot rush or afford mistakes. \n\"We are working with sincerity. We want relatives to understand, and be a bit patient. We want to hand over [the bodies] as soon as possible.\" \nOn Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent around 20 minutes at the site of the plane crash. \nHe did not speak to reporters afterwards but a video posted on his YouTube channel showed him walking around the site and inspecting the debris.\nModi also visited the location of a now-viral image that shows the tail of the crashed plane lodged in a building. \nEarlier on Friday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson also went to the crash site, later describing the visit as \"deeply moving\".\nAccording to data by tracking website, Flightradar24, the Boeing Dreamliner 787-8 had completed more than 700 flights in the year leading up to the Thursday's disaster. \nThe Air India plane was 11 years old and its most common routes included flights between Mumbai and Dubai, as well as the capital New Delhi and European destinations such as Milan, Paris and Amsterdam.\nThe plane had operated 25 flights from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick in the past two years.\nIndia's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 fleet, describing it as a \"preventive measure\".",

        "article_text": "Nearly two dozen paintings by one of the world's most celebrated modern artists - once part of a record-breaking art deal - are set to hit the auction block for the first time next week.\nOn 12 June, 25 rare MF Husain paintings will go under the hammer at an art gallery in Mumbai city, more than two decades after he painted them. \nThis will be the first public glimpse of the paintings, locked away in bank vaults since 2008 after authorities seized them from a prominent businessman over an alleged loan default.\n\"It's like the paintings have come full circle,\" says Dadiba Pundole, director of Pundole Art Gallery, where the auction is set to be held.\nHusain used the gallery as his studio for many of these works, part of an ambitious 100-painting series he never finished. Often called the \"Picasso of India,\" he was one of the country's most celebrated - and controversial - artists. His works have fetched millions, but his bold themes often drew criticism. He died in 2011, aged 95.\nTitled MF Husain: An Artist's Vision of the XX Century, the 25 paintings at Pundole'a gallery offer a glimpse into his take on a transformative century shaped by leaps in technology, politics, and culture. Pundole has estimated that the auction could fetch up to $29m (\u00a321m).\nThis comes months after another Husain painting, Untitled (Gram Yatra), sold for an unprecedented $13.8m at a Christie's auction in New York, becoming the most expensive Indian artwork to be auctioned.\nThe oil-on-canvas masterpiece had adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital for almost five decades, forgotten by the art world, until the auction house was alerted about its presence in 2013.\nThe latest paintings to be auctioned seem to follow a similar trajectory.\nHusain began working on them in the early 2000s, with great excitement and vigour, recalls Pundole.\n\"When he was painting, nothing could disturb him. It didn't matter what was happening around him,\" he adds.\nIn 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessman as the first instalment of a billion-rupee deal.\nKishore Singh, author of MF Husain: The Journey of a Legend, wrote about this agreement in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\"He [Husain] wasn't jealous of fellow artists, but he was competitive,\" Singh writes, noting that Husain struck the deal soon after Tyeb Mehta's Kali [an Indian goddess] set a new record for India's most expensive painting in 2002, selling for 15 million rupees.\nHusain struck a billion rupees deal with businessman Guru Swarup Srivastava for this series of paintings. Media dubbed it \"India's biggest art deal,\" catapulting the little-known Srivastava into overnight fame as a celebrity collector.\nBut two years later, India's top crime agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), began investigating Srivastava's business, alleging he and associates had misused a loan from a government-backed agricultural body.\nThe CBI alleged Srivastava diverted the funds into real estate, mutual funds, and  Husain paintings. He and his company deny all charges; the case remains in court.\nIn 2008, a tribunal allowed the government-backed agricultural body to seize one billion rupees in assets from Srivastava, including the 25 Husain paintings.\nIn February this year, a court cleared the way for the paintings to be auctioned to recover part of the loan. And so, after years locked away in bank vaults, the 25 paintings are finally stepping into the spotlight.\nIn a 2018 interview to author and journalist Tara Kaushal, Srivastava spoke about his stalled deal with the artist.\n\"I had planned to pay Husain for the rest of the paintings by selling the first 25. But legal complications meant that, when Husain called me in 2008 saying the paintings were ready in London and Paris, and to pick them up at the agreed price, my funds were not ready. He understood,\" he said.\nAsked why Husain had chosen to sell his paintings to a person who almost nobody knew in India's elite art circles, Pundole says, \"He didn't care. As long as his paintings were sold.\"\nThere's no way to know how Husain felt about the failed deal or his unfinished 20th Century series - but the episode remains a striking footnote in his bold, eventful career. \nThe 25 paintings in this series, vibrant acrylics on canvas, showcase Husain's bold style while reflecting key 20th-century events and social attitudes. \nOne painting shows an unlikely group chatting on a bench, symbolising Husain's call for peaceful dialogue and coexistence among global powers.\nAnother painting honours Charlie Chaplin while juxtaposing a rocket launch to highlight the contrast between social and economic disparities and massive state spending.\nOther paintings depict a world battling poverty, soldiers in trenches, and humanity confronting tragedies like World War Two, the Partition, and the Holocaust.

It didn't matter what was happening around him,\" he adds.In 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessman as the first instalment of a billion-rupee deal.Kishore Singh, author of MF Husain: The Journey of a Legend, wrote about this agreement in the Indian Express newspaper.",

        "article_text": "Atul Kumar (name changed) anxiously paced the corridor of a public hospital in India's capital Delhi.\nA small-appliance mechanic, he was struggling to secure medicines for his 26-year-old daughter who suffers from drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Mr Kumar said his daughter needed 22 tablets of Monopas, an antibiotic used for treating TB, every day. \n\"In the past 18 months, I haven't received government-supplied medicine for even two full months,\" he told BBC Hindi in January, months before India's declared deadline to eliminate the infectious disease.\nForced to buy costly drugs from private pharmacies, Mr Kumar was drowning in debt. A week's supply cost 1,400 rupees ($16; \u00a312), more than half his weekly income. \nAfter the BBC raised the issue, authorities supplied the medicines Mr Kumar's daughter needed. Federal Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said that the government usually acts quickly to fix medicine access issues when alerted.\nMr Kumar's daughter is one of millions of Indians suffering from tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that infects the lungs and is spread when the infected person coughs or sneezes.\nIndia, home to 27% of the world's tuberculosis cases, sees two TB-related deaths every three minutes. India's TB burden has long been tied to poor case detection, underfunding and erratic drug supply.\nDespite this grim reality, the country has set an ambitious goal. It aims to eliminate TB by the end of 2025, five years ahead of the global target set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations member states.\nElimination, as defined by the WHO, means cutting new TB cases by 80% and deaths by 90% compared with 2015 levels.\nBut visits to TB centres in Delhi and the eastern state of Odisha revealed troubling gaps in the government's TB programme.\nIn Odisha's Khordha district, around 30km (18.6 miles) from state capital Bhubaneshwar, 32-year-old day-labourer Kanhucharan Sahu is struggling to continue his two-year-old daughter's TB treatment, with government medicines unavailable for three months and private ones costing 1,500 rupees a month - an unbearable burden.\n\"We can't see her suffer anymore,\" he says, his voice breaking. \"We even thought of abandoning her.\"\nAt Odisha's local TB office, officials promised to review Sahu's case, but a staffer admitted, \"We rarely get the medicines we need, so we ration them.\"\nMr Sahu says he hasn't received the promised 1,000 rupees monthly support from the federal government and at the local TB office, officials admit to chronic shortages, leaving families like his adrift in a failing system.\nVijayalakshmi Routray, who runs the patient support group Sahyog, says medicine shortages are now routine, with government outlets often running dry. \"How can we talk about ending TB with such gaps?\" she asks.\nThere are other hurdles too - for example, changing treatment centres involves navigating complex bureaucracy, a barrier that often leads to missed doses and incomplete care. This poses a major hurdle for India's vast population of migrant workers.\nAt a hospital near Khordha, 50-year-old Babu Nayak, a sweeper who was diagnosed with TB in 2023, struggles to continue his treatment. He was regularly forced to travel 100km to his village for medicines as officials insisted he collect them from the original centre where he was diagnosed and first treated. \n\"It became too difficult,\" he says.\nUnable to travel so often, Mr Nayak stopped taking the medication altogether.\n\"It was a mistake,\" he admitted, after contracting TB again last year and being hospitalised.\nAt his hospital, no TB specialist was available, highlighting another critical gap in India's fight: a shortage of frontline health workers.\nThe BBC shared its findings with the federal health ministry and officials in charge of the TB programme in Delhi and Odisha. There was no response despite repeated reminders.\nA 2023 parliamentary report showed there were many vacant roles across all levels of the TB programme, affecting diagnosis, treatment and follow-up - especially in rural and underserved areas.\nIn 2018, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought forward India's TB elimination target to 2025, he cited the government's intensified efforts as a reason for optimism. \nTwo years later, the Covid pandemic disrupted TB elimination efforts globally, delaying diagnosis, diverting resources and pausing routine services. Medicine shortages, staff constraints and weakened patient monitoring have further widened the gap between ambition and reality.\nDespite these challenges, India has made some progress.\nOver the past decade, the country has reduced its tuberculosis-related mortality. Between 2015 and 2023, TB deaths declined from 28 to 22 per 100,000 people. This figure, however, is still high when compared with the global average which stands at 15.5.\nThe number of reported cases has gone up, which the government credits to its targeted outreach and screening programmes. In 2024, India recorded 2.6 million TB cases, up from 2.5 million in 2023.\nFederal Health Minister JP Nadda recently touted innovations like handheld X-ray devices as game-changers in expanding testing. But on the ground, the picture is less optimistic.\n\"I still see some patients come to me with reports of sputum (phlegm) smear microscopy for TB, a test which has a much lower detection rate as compared to genetic tests,\" says Dr Lancelot Pinto, a Mumbai-based epidemiologist.\nGenetic tests, which includes RT-PCR machines - widely used to diagnose HIV, influenza and most recently, Covid-19 - and Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing, also examine the sputum sample but with greater sensitivity and in a shorter timeframe.\nBesides, the tests can reveal whether the TB strain is drug-resistant or sensitive, something that microscopic testing can't do, Dr Pinto says.\nThe gap, he adds, stems not just from lack of awareness but from limited access to modern tests.\n\"Genetic testing is free at government hospitals but not uniformly available, with only a few states being able to provide it.\"\nIn May, Modi led a high-level review of India's TB elimination programme, reaffirming the country's commitment to defeating the disease.\nBut the official statement notably skipped mention of the 2025 deadline. Instead, it highlighted community-driven strategies - better sanitation, nutrition and social support for TB-affected families - as key to the fight.\nThe government has also prioritised better diagnosis, treatment and prevention at the core of its elimination strategy.\nThis approach mirrors the WHO's view of TB as a \"disease of poverty\". In its 2024 report, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called it \"the definitive disease of deprivation\", noting how poverty, malnutrition and treatment costs trap patients in a vicious cycle. As India pushes toward its goal of eliminating the disease, deep health and social inequalities remain hurdles.\nWith just six months left until India's self-imposed deadline, new complications have emerged.\nThe fallout from US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the WHO and suspension of USAID operations has raised concerns about future funding for global TB efforts. Since 1998, USAID has invested more than $140m to help diagnose and treat TB patients in India. \nHowever, India's federal health secretary insists there is \"no budgetary problem\" anticipated.\nMeanwhile, hope lies on the horizon. Sixteen TB vaccine candidates are currently in development across the world, with the WHO projecting potential availability within five years, pending successful trials.",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "It's a grim paradox, doctors say.\nOn the one hand, antibiotics are being overused until they no longer work, driving resistance and fuelling the rise of deadly superbugs. On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.\nA new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.\nIndia bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  \nCommon in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. \nThey can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.\n\"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups,\" says Dr Abdul Gaffar, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. \"We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die.\"\nThe irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.\n\"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need,\" says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.\nThe study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. \nResearchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. \nFor example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. \nWhat prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? \nPhysicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.\n\"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all,\" says Dr Gaffar. \"We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do.\"\nTo improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. \n\"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist,\" says Dr Gaffar. \"Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice.\"\nTo fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.\nIndia bears one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.\n\"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics,\" says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from promising new antibiotics to advanced diagnostics.\nDr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. \nThis would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. \nInnovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a \"hub-and-spoke approach\" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programs, researchers say.\nWithout access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. \n\"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access,\" says Dr Gaffar. \"When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients.\" \nClearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Her saffron sari was drenched in blood and she had no pulse.\n\"At the time, I didn't focus on it being the prime minister who was lying in front of me,\" Dr Bhargava told the BBC. \"My first thoughts were that we had to help her and also protect her from further harm,\" she said.\nDr Bhargava was worried that a mob would storm the casualty ward, as a large crowd had already begun gathering outside the hospital. \nNews began to trickle out: Gandhi had been shot by two Sikh bodyguards in revenge for Operation Blue Star, the military raid on Amritsar's Golden Temple in June to flush out militants.\nGandhi's assassination sparked one of the deadliest riots India has seen, the beginnings of which Dr Bhargava began hearing about as she hastened to shift the prime minister to one of the building's top floors.\nThere, in the operating theatre, a Sikh doctor fled the room the minute he heard how Gandhi had died.\nThe news of her death had to be kept under wraps until her son, Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as prime minister.\n\"Until then, our job, for the next four hours, was to keep up the charade that we were trying to save her life, when in fact she was dead when she was brought to AIIMS,\" Dr Bhargava writes.\nShe also described the harrowing process of embalming the prime minister's body, which would lie in state in the capital for two days before cremation.\n\"The embalming chemical, when we injected it into different main arteries, kept oozing out,\" Dr Bhargava writes. A ballistic report would later reveal that over three dozen bullets had punctured Gandhi's body.\nBut this wasn't the only remarkable episode in Dr Bhargava's long and illustrious career at AIIMS.\nIn the book she shares fascinating anecdotes of her interactions with other prominent politicians, including India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\nShe also recalls Sonia Gandhi bringing her son, a young Rahul to AIIMS after an arrow grazed his head while he was playing.\n\"Sonia Gandhi told me that she had to bring Rahul to us because Rajiv (her husband) was meeting the King of Jordan and the latter had given him a fancy car as a gift, which her husband was keen to drive,\" she writes in the book.\nRajiv Gandhi wanted to drive Rahul to AIIMS himself, without security, as a surprise - but Dr Bhargava firmly stopped him, citing safety concerns.\nBut not every day was as exciting.\nDr Bhargava recalls political pressure, including an MP who threatened her for not selecting his son-in-law for a job at AIIMS.\nOn another occasion, two top politicians, including the federal health secretary, tried to handpick the AIIMS dean - though the decision was hers alone.\nDr Bhargava says she stood firm against pressure, always prioritising patient care. She worked to establish radiology as a core part of diagnosis and treatment at AIIMS.\nWhen Dr Bhargava joined in the 1960s, AIIMS had only basic imaging tools. She trained colleagues to read subtle signs in black-and-white X-rays, always in context with the patient's history. She later pushed for better equipment, helping build one of India's leading radiology departments.\n\nDr Bhargava was always drawn to making a difference. \nBorn in 1930 into an affluent family in Lahore in undivided India, as a child she loved playing doctor to her dolls and siblings. During the partition of India and Pakistan, Dr Bhargava's family fled to India and later, she would visit refugee camps with her father to help people.\nAt a time when few Indian women pursued higher education, Dr Bhargava studied radiology in London - the only woman in both her class and hospital department.\nShe returned to India in the 1950s after hearing from her mentor that the country was in need of skilled radiologists.\nDr Bhargava often credits her family, and her husband's liberal-mindedness for helping her achieve her dreams, and she hopes other Indian women find the same support.\n\"It starts from childhood,\" she says. \n\"Parents should support their daughters the same way they support their sons.

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "For days, Imtiyaz Ali had been anxiously awaiting the findings of a preliminary report into last month's Air India crash that killed his brother, sister-in-law, and their two young children.\nWhen the report was finally released early on Saturday in India, he read it carefully - only to be disappointed by what he said \"reads like a product description\".\n\"Other than the pilots' final conversation, there's nothing in it that really points to what caused the crash.\"\nHe hopes more details will be made public in the months to come.\n\"This matters to us,\" Ali said. \"We want to know exactly what happened. It won't change anything for us now, we continue grieving - just as we have since that day. But at least we'll have some answers.\"\nThe London-bound Air India flight 171 crashed into a suburban neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad shortly after take-off on 12 June, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground.\nA preliminary investigative report released on Saturday in India said fuel to the engines of the plane cut off just seconds after take-off. The circumstances around how or why that happened remain unclear.\nThe report said that in recovered cockpit voice recordings, one of the pilots can be heard asking \"why did you cut off?\" - to which the other pilot replied he \"did not do so\".\nA final report into the crash is expected in 12 months.\nShweta Parihar, 41, also wants answers. Her husband, Abhinav Parishar, 43, was on his way back to London. He was meant to fly later in the month but decided to come home early and ended up on the ill-fated flight.\nShe laments that no investigation will ever bring her husband back.\n\"For those of us that have lost loved ones, we've lost them, they are not coming back,\" she said.\n\"What will they do in the investigation, tell us how it happened? The life of how many people, 250 passengers, what will they say, sorry? Everything is done, everything is finished.\"\nParihar becomes emotional when she talks about the impact of the loss on her 11-year-old son Vihaan.\n\"He misses his dad badly,\" she said tearfully. Vihaan tells her that he won't fly Air India ever again.\nBadasab Syed, 59, lost his brother, sister-in-law, and their two children in the crash.\nHe was hoping for answers from the preliminary report, but after watching the news, said he was left with more questions.\n\"The report mentions the pilots discussing who turned off fuel and a possible issue with the fuel control switch. We don't know, what does that mean? Was this avoidable?\"\nBadasab Syed says his younger brother, Inayat Syed, 49 was the heart of the family. Losing him, his wife and children, has shattered the entire family. The grief has been especially difficult on his 83-year-old mother, Bibi Sab.\n\"Losing her son and grandchildren has made her weak. I think she is not able to even tell us how she feels,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "Long before India gained independence, one defiant voice inside the British Empire dared to call out a colonial massacre - and paid a price for it.\nSir Chettur Sankaran Nair, a lawyer, was one of the few Indians to be appointed to top government posts when the British ruled the country.   \nIn 1919, he resigned from the Viceroy's Council after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the northern Indian city of Amritsar in Punjab, in which hundreds of civilians attending a public meeting were shot dead by British troops. On the 100th anniversary of the massacre, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May described the tragedy as a \"shameful scar\" on Britain's history in India.\nNair's criticism of Punjab's then Lieutenant Governor, Michael O'Dwyer, led to a libel case against him, which helped spotlight the massacre and the actions of British officials.\nIn a biography of Nair, KPS Menon, independent India's first foreign secretary, described him as \"a very controversial figure of his time\". \nNair was known for his independent views and distaste for extremist politics, and spoke critically of colonial rule and even of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian independence hero who is now regarded as the father of the nation. \nMenon, who married Nair's daughter Saraswathy, wrote: \"Only [Nair] could have insulted the all powerful British Viceroy on his face and opposed Mahatma Gandhi openly.\"\nNair was not a familiar name in India in recent decades, but earlier this year, a Bollywood film based on the court case, Kesari Chapter 2- starring superstar Akshay Kumar - helped bring attention to his life.\nNair was born in 1857 into a wealthy family in what is now Palakkad district in Kerala state. He studied at the Presidency College in Madras, acquiring a bachelor's degree before studying law and beginning his career as an apprentice with a Madras High Court judge.\nIn 1887, he joined the social reform movement in the Madras presidency. Throughout his career, he fought to reform Hindu laws of the time on marriage and women's rights and to abolish the caste system.\nFor some years, he was a delegate to the Indian National Congress and presided over its 1897 session in Amraoti (Amravati). In his address, he held the British-run government \"morally responsible for the extreme poverty of the masses\", saying the annual famines \"claimed more victims and created more distress than under any civilised government anywhere else in the world\". \nHe was appointed public prosecutor in 1899 and writes in his autobiography about advising the government on seditious articles in newspapers, including those by his close friend G Subramania Iyer, the first editor of The Hindu newspaper. \"On many occasions\u2026 I was able to persuade them not to take any step against him.\"\nHe became a high court judge in 1908 and was knighted four years later.\nNair moved to Delhi in 1915 when he was appointed a member of the Viceroy's Council, only the third Indian to hold the position. \nHe was a fierce proponent of India's right to govern itself and pushed for constitutional reforms during his time on the council. Through 1918 and 1919, his dissent and negotiations with Edwin Montagu, then secretary of state for India, helped expand provisions of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms which laid out how India would gradually achieve self-governance.\nMontagu wrote in his diary that he had been warned \"that it was absolutely necessary to get him on my side, for Sankaran Nair wielded more influence than any other Indian\".\nA pivotal moment in Nair's career as a statesman was the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh, when hundreds of unarmed Indians were shot dead in a public garden on the day of the Baisakhi festival. Official estimates said nearly 400 people were killed and more than 1,500 wounded by the soldiers, who fired under the orders of Brigadier General REH Dyer. Indian sources put the death toll closer to 1,000.\nNair writes in his 1922 book Gandhi and Anarchy about following the events in Punjab with increasing concern. The shooting at Jallianwala Bagh was part of a larger crackdown in the province, where martial law had been introduced - the region was cut off from the rest of the country and no newspapers were allowed into it.\n\"If to govern the country, it is necessary that innocent persons should be slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh and that any Civilian Officer may, at any time, call in the military and the two together may butcher the people as at Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in,\" he wrote.\nA month later, he resigned from the council and left for Britain, where he hoped to rouse public opinion on the massacre.\nIn his memoir, Nair writes of speaking to the editor of The Westminster Gazette which soon published an article called the Amritsar Massacre. Other papers including The Times also followed suit.\n\"Worse things had happened under British rule, but I am glad I was able to obtain publicity for this one at least,\" Nair wrote.\nNair's book Gandhi and Anarchy drew the ire of several Indian nationalists of the time after he criticised Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, calling it a \"weapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our purpose\".\nBut it was the few passages condemning Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, that became the basis for the libel suit against him in 1924. \nNair accused O'Dwyer of terrorism, holding him responsible for the atrocities committed by the civil government before the imposition of martial law. \nA five-week trial in the Court of King's Bench in London ruled 11:1 in favour of O'Dwyer, awarding damages of \u00a3500 and \u00a37,000 in costs to him.\nO'Dwyer offered to forgo this for an apology but Nair refused and paid instead.\nReports of the depositions in the hearing were published daily in The Times. Nair's family says despite losing, the case achieved his purpose of having the atrocities brought to public attention. \nNair's great-grandson Raghu Palat, who co-wrote the book The Case That Shook the Empire, with his wife Pushpa, says the case helped spark \"an uproar for the freedom movement\".\nIt also showed that \"there was no point in having a dominion status under the empire when the British cannot be expected to deal with their subjects fairly\", adds Pushpa.\nEven Gandhi referred to the case several times, writing once that Nair had showed pluck in fighting without hope of victory, historian PC Roy Chaudhury later pointed out.\nAfter losing the case, Nair continued with his career in India. He was chairman of the Indian Committee of the Simon Commission, which reviewed the working of constitutional reforms in India in 1928.\nHe died in 1934 at the age of 77.\nThrough his career, Menon notes, Nair \"bent all his thoughts and energies on the emancipation of his country from the bondage of foreign domination and native custom. In this task, he achieved as much success as any man, wedded to constitutional methods\".",

        "article_text": "\"My neighbours thought I'd lost my mind,\" says farmer Kakasaheb Sawant.\nIn 2022 he had decided to plant some apple trees, not crazy for a farmer unless, like Mr Sawant, you live in subtropical southern India, where temperatures can hit 43C.\nHe bought 100 saplings, of which 80 survived. Last year each tree produced between 30 and 40 kilogrammes of fruit.\n\"My farm has become something of a local miracle. People travel from far-off places just to see the apple trees growing under the hot Maharashtra sun.\"\nIt's not been an unqualified success though. One problem is that the apples are not sweet enough to sell.\nMr Sawant remains enthusiastic. He's had some success selling apple tree saplings and is optimistic about future harvests.\n\"This is the beginning. The trees are getting acclimatised so according to me in next four to five years these trees will start bearing good, sweet apples.\"\nIn his own small way, Mr Sawant is hoping to meet India's rising demand for apples. \nProduction has risen 15% over the last five years to 2.5 million tonnes.\nBut that is not keeping up with demand and India's imports have roughly doubled to 600,000 tonnes over the same period, according to S Chandrashekhar, who analyses India's apple trade. \n\"We do have a shortage of apple production,\" he says. \"There are not many new players... at the same time, and there is no new investment.\"\nEssential for a good apple crop is a lengthy period of winter temperature between 0C and 6C.\nCountries like the UK, with around 1,000 hours of this chill-time, can produce almost any apple variety.\nBut in India areas with those conditions are more limited. \nMost of India's apples come from two regions in the north of the country -Jammu and Kashmir and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh.\nMr Chandrashekhar says that many farms in those regions are becoming less productive. \n\"There are lot of old orchards producing fewer apples - that means the yield is coming down,\" he says.\nHe says that climate change is making conditions less favourable.\n\nIn the hope of expanding apple production into new areas, some scientists and farmers are experimenting with so-called low-chill varieties.\nThose are apple trees that can produce crops with around 400 hours of temperatures between 0C and 6C.\nRanchi, eastern India is also not an apple growing region - its subtropical climate is too hot. \nBut researchers at the Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) are testing 18 saplings of three low-chill varieties.\nSuccess has been limited so far -  only one of the varieties has produced any fruit. \n\"The plants have not reached optimal sizes. The tree has given us only around one to two kilogrammes of apples in 2024.  I would not say that they are of best quality, but they were edible,\" says Dr Majid Ali. \nHe says that as well as an unfavourable climate, the local soil is not ideal for apple trees and the trees get attacked by termites.\n\"This is an experimental stage. To reach a conclusion it would take three to four years to say if it is successful.\"\nHe says that some local farmers have also been experimenting with low-chill apple varieties, also with little success. \nSome are sceptical that apples cultivated in hot areas will ever be a commercial proposition. \n\"The fruit that grows in non-traditional regions has a very short shelf life. The taste is not so sweet,\" says Dr Dinesh Thakur, associate director of a regional horticulture research and training centre at Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry.\n\"These low-chill apples can be grown as novelty fruit in a kitchen garden, but their viability as a commercial crop is not proven... most of them are a failure,\" he says. \nDr Thakur is based in the traditional northern apple growing region of Himachal Pradesh and his research focuses on the improvement of apples through breeding.\n\"Climatic change is creating havoc in apple cultivation,\" he says. \nHe says the number of those crucial chilling hours are falling and due to erratic weather conditions farmers are facing colossal financial losses every year. \nIn search of better conditions, some orchards are being planted in higher locations, which were once considered too cold, he says.\nUnder a government sponsored project his team are experimenting with 300 varieties of apples, to assess the impact of climate change.\n\"We are also working on climate-resilient apple genotypes that can withstand the existing climate,\" he says.\nSo far, they have developed an apple that matures with a ripe colour two months earlier than existing apple trees. \n\"This helps offset erratic weather patterns brought by climate change and has a quality advantage over those areas where  colour formation is problem due to lack of sunlight,\" Dr Thakur says. \n\"This is just the beginning of research to create climate resilient fruit and create a fruit that is acceptable to the Indian taste bud.\"\nFor Mr Chandrashekhar, boosting India's apple output will take more than just scientific work. \n\"Apple orchards in the traditional apple cultivation areas are 15 to 20 years old. What is needed is replanting of new saplings,\" he says.\n\"The industry needs investment, huge investment. Who will do that?\" he asks.\nHe would like to see the juice and jam business developed, to provide the industry with another source of income. \n\"That has to be a booster which can improve the apple economy and provide a better position for apple growers.\"",

Its crew included Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to have gone to space.\nHis trip came 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma flew aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - was a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. \nOn Monday, ISS posted on X that the Ax-4 crew had taken their places in the spacecraft and its hatches had been closed. The undocking of the craft - when it separated from the ISS - was broadcast live. \nOn Tuesday morning, Axiom Space said the craft would announce its arrival with a brief sonic boom before splashing down in the ocean off the coast of California, after which a vessel would pick it up. The crew would then be flown out to land in a helicopter.\nIn his farewell address from aboard the ISS on Sunday, the Indian astronaut said India's journey in space exploration may be tough, but it has begun.\n\"It has been an incredible journey. Even though now it is coming to an end, for you and me there is a long way to go. The journey of our human space mission is very long and difficult. But if we are determined, even the stars are attainable.\"\nHe referred to India's first man in space cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma famously quoting from a 1924 Urdu song \"Sare jahan se achcha\" to say \"India looked better than the rest of the world\".\n\"Even today we want to know how it looks from space.

        "article_text": "When 26-year-old Umar Sofi received his acceptance letter from Columbia University's School of Journalism, he thought the hardest part of his journey was over. \nAfter trying for three years, Mr Sofi had finally been admitted to his dream university and even secured a partial scholarship. He quit his job in anticipation of the big move. \nBut on 27 May, when the US suddenly paused student visa appointments, the ground slipped from beneath his feet.\n\"I was numb. I could not process what had happened,\" Mr Sofi, who lives in Indian-administered Kashmir, told the BBC. \nSome 2,000km (1,242 miles) away in Mumbai, 17-year-old Samita Garg (name changed on request) went through a similar ordeal. \nA day after she was accepted into a top US university to study biochemistry - her first step towards becoming a dermatologist - the US embassy halted student visa appointments.\n\"It is scary and stressful,\" Ms Garg told the BBC over the phone. \"It feels like I've been left in the lurch, not knowing when this will end.\"\nBoth Mr Sofi and Ms Garg now have only a few weeks to secure their visas before the academic year begins in August, but little clarity on whether they can go ahead with their plans. \nLast month President Donald Trump's administration asked US embassies across the world to stop scheduling appointments for student visas and expand social media vetting of applicants.\nThis wider move followed a crackdown on America's elite universities like Harvard, which Trump accused of being too liberal and of not doing enough to combat antisemitism. \nTrump's decisions have had far-reaching repercussions in India, which sends more international students to the US than any other country. \nOver the last month, the BBC spoke with at least 20 students at various stages of their application process, all of whom echoed deep anxieties about their futures. Most chose to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from the US government and worried that speaking out now could hurt their chances of obtaining a visa, or renewing it. \nMore than 1.1 million international students were enrolled in US colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to Open Doors, an organisation that collects data on foreign students. \nNearly a third of them, or more than 330,000, were from India.\nEducational consultants report that applications to US universities for the upcoming autumn semester have dropped by at least 30% because of the uncertainty. \n\"Their biggest fear is safety - what if their visas are rejected or they're deported mid-term?\" said Naveen Chopra, founder of TC Global, an international education consultancy.\nExperts say many students are now either deferring their plans or switching to countries perceived to be more \"stable\" like the UK, Germany, Ireland and Australia. \nPrema Unni (name changed on request) was accepted into three US universities for a master's in data analytics. But instead of preparing for the move, he decided to forgo the opportunity altogether.\n\"There's uncertainty at every step - first the visa, then restrictions on internships and part-time work, and the constant surveillance while on campus,\" Mr Unni said. \"It is very stressful.\"\nThe halt on visa interviews is the latest in a series of policies tightening immigration rules for students. A few weeks ago, the US warned that students who drop out or miss classes without proper notification risk having their visas revoked, and could be barred from future entry.\nThese decisions have come around the time of the year when 70% of student visas are issued, or renewed, sparking great unease among Indian students. \n\"No student wants to go to a country and then have the visa policy suddenly change,\" Chris R Glass, a professor at Boston College told the BBC. \"They need stability and options.\"\nThe uncertainty will have long-term consequences - both for the aspirations of Indian students, but also for the US's future as a coveted higher education hub - says Prof Glass. \nForeign student enrolment in US universities was slowing even before Trump's latest salvo. \nAccording to The Indian Express newspaper, the US denied 41% of student visa applications between the fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the highest rejection rate in a decade, and nearly doubling from 2014.\nData from Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS), which tracks foreign students' compliance with their visas, showed a nearly 10% drop in international student enrolments as of March this year compared with the same period in 2024. \nInternational students are a financial lifeline for many US colleges, especially regional and state universities offering STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and other master's programmes. \nThese students pay significantly higher tuition fees than US citizens. \nIn the 2023\u201324 academic year alone, foreign students contributed $43.8bn to the US economy, according to Nafsa, an association of International educators. They also supported over 375,000 jobs. \n\"This really isn't about a short-term disruption of tuition revenue. This is about a long-term rupture in a strategic relationship that benefits both countries,\"  Prof Glass said. \nFor decades the brightest Indian students have depended on an American education in the absence of top quality Indian universities or a supportive research ecosystem. \nIn turn they've helped plug a skills gap in the US. \nMany land highly sought-after jobs after they finish their courses - in particular, representing a significant pool of skilled professionals in sectors like biotechnology, healthcare and data science - and have even gone on to lead iconic companies. \nEveryone from Google's Sunder Pichai to Microsoft's Satya Nadella went to the US as students. \nWhile this has often led to concerns of a \"brain-drain\" from India, experts point out that India is simply unable to solve the problem of quality and quantity higher education in the immediate future to provide a domestic alternative to these students.\nExperts say it will be a lose-lose situation for both countries, unless the cloud of uncertainty lifts soon. \nAdditional reporting by Divya Uppal, BBC India's YouTube team, in Delhi. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "\"Let me tell you a secret. Your nana (grandfather) helped Jewish families escape the Nazis.\"\nThat single sentence from his mother set Vinay Gupta off on a journey into his grandfather's past. What he unearthed was a tale more gripping than fiction: a little-known act of heroism by an Indian businessman who risked everything to save strangers in Europe's darkest hour.\nThis wasn't just compassion; it was logistics, risk, and resolve. Back in India, Kundanlal set up a businesses to employ Jews, built homes to house them - only to watch the British declare them as \"enemy aliens\" and detain them once World War Two broke out.\nKundanlal's life reads like an epic: a poor boy from Ludhiana, married at 13, who sold everything from timber and salt to lab gear and bullock-cart wheels. He also ran a clothing business and a matchstick factory. He topped his class in Lahore - joining the colonial civil service at 22, only to resign from it all to participate in the freedom movement and a life of building factories.\nHe shook hands with Indian independence leader and later its first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and crossed paths with actress Devika Rani on a steamer to Europe.\nIn A Rescue In Vienna, a family memoir, Gupta uncovers his grandfather's  extraordinary Indian rescue on foreign soil - pieced together through family letters, survivor interviews, and historical records.\nIn the shadow of Hitler's 1938 annexation of Austria, Kundanlal, a machine tool manufacturer from Ludhiana city in the northern state of Punjab, quietly offered Jewish professionals jobs in India to get them life-saving visas. He offered work,  provided livelihood and build homes for those families in India. \nKundanlal rescued five families.\nFritz Weiss, a 30-year-old Jewish lawyer, was hiding in a hospital, feigning illness. Kundanlal was also in the same hospital to get treatment for an illness. \nAfter Nazis forced Weiss to clean the streets outside his own home, Kundanlal handed him a lifeline: a job offer at the fictitious \"Kundan Agencies.\" It got him a visa to India.\nAlfred Wachsler, a master woodworker, met Kundanlal while bringing his pregnant wife for tests. Promised a future in furniture and a sponsor for emigration, his family became one of the Jewish households to reach India between January 1938 and February 1939. \nHans Losch, a textile technician, answered Kundanlal's advert in an Austrian paper for skilled workers. Offered a managerial role at the imaginary \"Kundan Cloth Mills\" in Ludhiana - with housing, profit share, and safe passage - he seized the chance to start over.\nAlfred Schafranek, once owner of a 50-employee plywood factory, pitched his skills to Kundanlal and was offered a role in building India's most modern plywood unit. His entire family, including his mechanic brother Siegfried, was rescued.\nAnd Siegmund Retter, a machine tools businessman, was among the first Kundanlal approached. As his business collapsed under Nazi rule, Kundanlal began arranging his move to India to start again.\nIt all began with a hospital bed in Vienna. \nStruggling with diabetes and hemorrhoids, Kundanlal, then 45, sought new treatments and read about a specialist in Vienna. In 1938, while recovering from surgery there, he met Lucy and Alfred Wachsler, a young couple expecting their first child. From them, he learned of rising antisemitic violence and the destruction of Jewish lives. \nOver the next few months, he met other men. Encouraged by this success, Kundanlal placed newspaper adverts seeking skilled workers willing to relocate to India. Among the respondents were Wachsler, Losch, Schafranek and Retter. Kundanlal offered each a job, financial guarantees, and support to secure Indian visas.\n\"A striking aspect of all of Kundanlal's elaborate scheming on behalf of these families was how close mouthed he remained, keeping up appearances of technology transfer to India until the very end,\" Gupta writes. \n\"He did not share his intent or plans with any Indian or British officials. His family learned of his plans only when he returned home months later.\" \nIn October 1938, Losch became the first of Kundanlal's recruits to arrive in Ludhiana. \nHe was welcomed into Kundanlal's home - but found little comfort in the quiet town, writes Gupta. With no Jewish community, no cultural life, and a struggling cloth mill, Losch left within weeks for Bombay (now Mumbai), citing poor working conditions and little chance of profit. He never returned.\nWeiss lasted even less - just under two months. The company created for him, Kundan Agencies, never took off. He soon moved to Bombay, found work in flooring, and by 1947 had relocated to England. \nDespite their departures, Kundanlal bore no resentment, writes Gupta.\n\"My aunt told me that on the contrary, Kundanlal had been embarrassed that he could not provide a lifestyle and social environment more suited to Vienna, and felt that if he had, the two men may have stayed on in Ludhiana.\" \nNot all stories ended this way.\nAlfred and Lucy Wachsler, with their infant son, arrived by sea, rail, and road - finally stepping off the train at Ludhiana. \nThey moved into a spacious home Kundanlal built for them next door to another, prepared for the Schafraneks. Alfred quickly set up a furniture workshop, using Burmese teak and local Sikh labour to craft elegant dining sets - one of which still survives in the author's family.\nIn March 1939, Alfred Schafranek, his brother Siegfried, and their families arrived from Austria. They launched one of India's earliest plywood factories in a shed behind the two homes. \nDriven and exacting, Alfred pushed untrained workers hard, determined to build something lasting. Gupta writes, the work was intense, the Punjab heat unfamiliar, and the isolation palpable - especially for the women, confined mostly to domestic life.\nAs the months passed in Ludhiana, the initial relief gave way to boredom. \nThe men worked long hours, while the women, limited by language and isolation, kept to household routines. \nIn September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. Days later, Britain declared war on Germany - the British parliament pulled India into the conflict. Over 2.5 million Indians would serve in the war, 87,000 never returned.\nIn Ludhiana, the reality of war hit fast. \nBy 1940, new policies ordered all German nationals - Jewish or not - into internment camps. \nThe Wachsler and Schafranek families were forcibly relocated to the Purandhar Internment Camp near Poona (now Pune), housed in bare barracks with kerosene lamps and minimal comforts. They had committed no crime - only carried the wrong passport.\nEventually, release became possible - if they could find paid work. \nAlfred and Siegfried Schafranek secured roles managing a new plywood business in Bangalore and moved there with their families, starting all over again. The Wachsler family left the camp in 1942 after Alfred found a job in Karachi. The two families never met again.\nPurandhar Camp closed in 1946, nearly a year after the war ended. \nIn 1948, Alfred Wachsler's cousin sponsored US refugee visas for the family. That October, they flew out of Karachi, never to return to India. The Schafraneks relocated to Australia in 1947 after a successful plywood venture in Bangalore.\nWhile researching the book, Gupta met Alex Wachsler - whose father, Alfred, had also built the Burmese teak desk Kundanlal once used in his tiny 120 sq ft office. (Alfred died in 1973.)\n\"Despite living in US since the age of 10, and now into his eighties, Alex Wachsler still pines for his life in India, eats at Indian restaurants, delights in meeting Indians and surprises them with his knowledge of Urdu,\" writes Gupta.\nBack in Ludhiana, Kundanlal opened a school for his daughters at home, soon expanding it into one of Punjab's oldest schools - still running today with 900 students. His wife, Saraswati, grew increasingly withdrawn and battled depression.\nKundanlal and Saraswati had five children, including four daughters. In 1965, Saraswati died after a tragic fall from their terrace. She spent her final years in silence, emotionally distanced from the family. Kundanlal passed away a year later, aged 73, from a heart attack. \n\"The notion of a 'passive bystander' was anathema to Kundanlal. If he saw something, or someone, that required attention, he attended to it, never intimidated by the enormity of the problem,\" writes Gupta.\nA fitting epitaph for a man whose legacy was not just business, but quiet defiance, compassion, and conviction.",

        "article_text": "Shona Banu still shudders when she thinks of the past few days.\nThe 58-year-old, a resident of Barpeta district in India's north-eastern state of Assam, says that she was called to the local police station on 25 May and later taken to a point at the border with neighbouring Bangladesh. From there, she says, she and around 13 other people were forced to cross over to Bangladesh. \nShe says she was not told why. But it was a scenario she had been dreading - Ms Banu says she has lived in Assam all her life but for the past few years, she has been desperately trying to prove that she is an Indian citizen and not an \"illegal immigrant\" from Bangladesh.\n\"They pushed me over at gunpoint. I spent two days without food or water in the middle of a field in knee-deep water teeming with mosquitoes and leeches,\" Ms Banu said, wiping away tears. After those two days in no man's land - between India and Bangladesh - she says she was taken to what appeared to be an old prison on the Bangladeshi side.\nAfter two days there, she and a few others - she is not sure if all of them were from the same group sent with her - were escorted by Bangladeshi officials across the border, where Indian officials allegedly met them and sent them home.\nIt's not clear why Ms Banu was abruptly sent to Bangladesh and then brought back. But her case is among a spate of recent instances where officials in Assam have rounded up people declared foreigners by tribunals in the past - on suspicion of being \"illegal Bangladeshis\" - and sent them across the border. The BBC found at least six cases where people said their family members had been picked up, taken to border towns and just \"pushed across\".\nOfficials from India's Border Security Force, the Assam police and the state government did not respond to questions from the BBC.\nCrackdowns on alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are not new in India - the countries are divided by a 4,096km (2,545 miles) long porous border which can make it relatively easy to cross over, even though many of the sensitive areas are heavily guarded.\nBut it's still rare, lawyers working on these cases say, for people to be picked up from their homes abruptly and forced into another country without due process. These efforts seem to have intensified over the past few weeks.\nThe Indian government has not officially said how many people were sent across in the latest exercise. But top sources in the Bangladesh administration claim that India \"illegally pushed in\" more than 1,200 people into the country in May alone, not just from Assam but also other states. Out of this, they said on condition of anonymity, Bangladesh identified 100 people as Indian citizens and sent them back.\nIn a statement, the Border Guard Bangladesh said it had increased patrolling along the border to curb these attempts. \nIndia has not commented on these allegations.\nWhile media reports indicate that the recent crackdown includes Rohingya Muslims living in other states too, the situation is particularly tense and complex in Assam, where issues of citizenship and ethnic identity have long dominated politics. \nThe state, which shares a nearly 300km-long border with Muslim-majority Bangladesh, has seen waves of migration from the neighbouring country as people moved in search of opportunities or fled religious persecution.\nThis has sparked the anxieties of Assamese people, many of whom fear this is bringing in demographic change and taking away resources from locals.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party - in power in Assam and nationally - has repeatedly promised to end the problem of illegal immigration, making the state's National Register of Citizens (NRC) a priority in recent years.\nThe register is a list of people who can prove they came to Assam by 24 March 1971, the day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan. \nThe list went through several iterations, and after a chaotic process, the final draft published in 2019 excluded nearly two million residents of Assam. Many of them say they already spent time in detention camps in the past after foreigners' tribunals - quasi-judicial forums - declared them illegal. Lawyers say people excluded from the final draft can only file an appeal once there is a gazette notification - an authorised legal government document. This hasn't been issued yet.\nMs Banu said her appeal against a foreigners' tribunal order is pending in the Supreme Court but that authorities still forced her to leave.\nThe BBC heard similar stories from at least six others in Assam - all Muslims - who say their family members were sent to Bangladesh around the same time as Ms Banu, despite having necessary documents and living in India for generations. At least four of them have now come back home, with no answers still about why they were picked up.\nA third of Assam's 32 million residents are Muslims and many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled there during British rule.\nMaleka Khatun, a 67-year-old from Assam's Barpeta who is still in Bangladesh, says she has temporarily been given shelter by a local family.\n\"I have no-one here,\" she laments. Her family has managed to speak to her but don't know if and when she can return. She lost her case in the foreigners' tribunal and in the state's high court and hadn't appealed in the Supreme Court.\nDays after the recent round of action began, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma cited a February Supreme Court direction which ordered the government to start deportation proceedings for people who had been \"declared foreigners\" but were still held in detention centres.\n\"The people who are declared foreigners but haven't even appealed in court, we are pushing them back,\" Sarma said. He also claimed that people with pending court appeals were not being \"troubled\".\nBut Abdur Razzaque Bhuyan, a lawyer working on many citizenship cases in Assam, alleged that in many of the recent instances, due process - which would, among other things, require India and Bangladesh to cooperate on the action - was not followed.\n\"What is happening is a wilful and deliberate misinterpretation of the court order,\" he said.\nMr Bhuyan recently filed a petition on behalf of a student organisation seeking the Supreme Court's intervention in stopping what they said was a \"forceful and illegal pushback policy\" but was asked to first approach the Assam high court.\nIn Morigaon, around 167km from Barpeta, Reeta Khanum sat near a table which had a pile of papers on it.\nHer husband Khairul Islam, a 51-year-old school teacher, was in the same group as Ms Banu that was allegedly picked up by authorities.\nA tribunal had declared him a foreigner in 2016, after which he spent two years in a detention centre before being released. Like Ms Banu, his case is also being heard in the Supreme Court.\n\"Every document is proof that my husband is Indian,\" Ms Khanum said, leafing through what she said was Mr Islam's high school graduation certificate and some land records. \"But that wasn't enough to prove his nationality to authorities.\" \nShe says her husband, his father and grandfather were all born in India.\nBut on 23 May, she says that policemen arrived at their home and took Mr Islam away without any explanation.\nIt was only a few days later - when a viral video surfaced of a Bangladeshi journalist interviewing Mr Islam in no man's land - that the family learnt where he was.\nLike Ms Banu, Mr Islam has now been sent back to India. \nWhile his family confirmed his return, the police told the BBC they had \"no information\" about his arrival.\nSanjima Begum says she is sure her father was declared a foreigner due to a case of mistaken identity - he was also taken on the same night as Mr Islam. \n\"My father's name is Abdul Latif, my grandfather was Abdul Subhan. The notice that came [years ago, from the foreigners' tribunal] said Abdul Latif, son of Shukur Ali. That's not my grandfather, I don't even know him,\" Ms Begum said, adding that she had all the necessary documents to prove her father's citizenship.\nThe family has now heard that Mr Latif is back in Assam, but he hasn't reached home yet.\nWhile some of these people are back home now, they fear they might be picked up again abruptly.\n\"We are not playthings,\" Ms Begum said. \n\"These are human beings, you can't toss them around as per your whims.\"\nAdditional reporting by Aamir Peerzada and Pritam Roy\nA line in the original article incorrectly said that many people left out of the final NRC draft were either put in detention camps or have appealed in higher courts. Many of those left out of the NRC had spent time in detention camps in previous years when they were deemed foreigners by Assamese tribunals and not after the publication of the final draft.

        "article_text": "England pulled off their second-highest successful run chase in a Test to beat India at Headingley\nTest cricket is brilliant.\nYou may have known that long before England's defeat of India in the first Test, or discovered it through what happened at Headingley.\nLast Wednesday morning, the day after England strolled a chase of 371, there was a spike in social media engagement with posts giving love to the five-day game. \"Test cricket is the best format\", \"the Rolls Royce of our great game\", \"there's nothing else like Test cricket\". Naturally, there was a bit of Hundred bashing in there, too.\nThese outbursts of support each time there is a half-decent Test are a strange phenomenon, akin to a subculture being vindicated for a passion in something that would otherwise seem a bit weird. Like admitting to a love of Warhammer, pro wrestling or McFly (no, yes, sometimes - in case you're wondering).\nCompared with other sports, there is not the same fervour after a Premier League thriller, tense final round of a golf major or five-set epic at Wimbledon. Not the same need to proclaim \"that is why (insert sport here) is the best\".\nThere are good reasons for Test cricket devotees to feel under attack, and therefore moved to defend their corner.\nNo other sport has the multiple formats of cricket, something that should be a strength but instead has become its biggest weakness. No other sport has so violently torn itself apart, even if golf has given it a good go.\nArcher kept on to bond with England squad as India ponder changes\nFlintoff not thinking about becoming England coach\nRabbit pie: Why England's Tongue is so good against tailenders\nThis is not meant to be a dig at franchise and short-form leagues. They can be excellent in their own right. In a competitive global market, it is remarkable that what is essentially a new sport has become so lucrative in little more than 20 years.\nWhere all the different elements of cricket should be able to rub along together for the betterment of each other, we have somehow landed in a civil war, almost exclusively fuelled by the game's administrators.\nTake The Hundred as an example. English cricket is right to have a franchise league and the money due to come in should be lauded as a fantastic opportunity for the sport in this country. Instead, The Hundred has never recovered from the awful PR of its launch, a message of 'cricket for people who do not like cricket'. It alienated those already enthralled by the game, who are now stirred to protect their bit of it.\nThe fabric of Test cricket has been chipped away by poor scheduling and the pursuit of dollars, pounds and rupees. If it is eradicated to nothing, leaving a revolving roadshow of leagues, cricket will be infinitely poorer for it.\nAn obvious solution is to separate the calendar into dedicated windows for the different formats, just like football and rugby ringfence various times for international and domestic competitions. Now it is down to cricket's governors to show the required guts and gumption.\nThe irony of Test cricket being under attack is the on-field product has never been so good.\nSince the beginning of 2024, West Indies have won in Brisbane, England in Hyderabad and Sri Lanka at The Oval.\nEveryone has an opinion on the impenetrable format of the World Test Championship, yet it still managed to produce a joyous final at Lord's last month, with South Africa finally climbing the mountain by toppling the mighty Australians.\nEven in the past week, away from Leeds, West Indies flirted with pulling off something special against the Aussies in Barbados, and in Zimbabwe 19-year-old Lhuan-dre Pretorius became the youngest man to make a hundred for South Africa. Keep an eye on him, a megastar of the future.\nMore broadly, runs are being scored faster, wickets taken more regularly, there are more close matches and fewer draws than ever before.\nThe run-rate across all Test cricket in the past three years has been 3.60, the highest of any three-year period. Over the same time, less than 10% of Tests were drawn, down from more than 20% across the previous 20 years and more than 40% historically.\nIt is a disregard for draws that marks England's Bazballers out as innovators.\nIt would be hyperbole to say they have saved Test cricket, still not unreasonable to say they have altered the perspective on the way it could be played - 37 Tests and counting since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum united, only one soggy draw among them.\nDraws can be thrilling - some wonderful Tests have been drawn - but by being so bullish about not considering a stalemate as a possibility, this England team have added a thrilling aspect to the five-day narrative.\nFor those watching, it leaves the wonder of how England will attempt to force a result, regardless of the situation. For opponents, it leaves the fear of always being in danger, the confusion of what it will take to beat Stokes' team. For England, it gives the clarity of thought to attempt and comfortably complete a run chase like the one in Leeds, removing the seed of doubt sewn by the safety net of a draw.\nAs an opening chapter of a 10-part story, comprising this India series and the Ashes against Australia this winter, Headingley was perfect, more than living up to the pre-match billing. There will have been plenty of other series with as much expectation as the two England are undertaking, though it is hard to remember a time when Test cricket has been in such sharp focus for a period of time as prolonged as the next seven months.\nEngland were favourites at Headingley and could, probably should, have lost. India paid the price for dropped catches, a crucial Harry Brook wicket off a no-ball and a tail that refused to wag.\nAs a result, the tourists are in a muddle at Edgbaston. Do they play another one of their Jasprit Bumrah chips, leaving only one for the rest of the series? Will they find a place for magician wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav and simultaneously boost their lower-order batting?\nEngland are settled, with the prospect of Jofra Archer returning for the third Test next week at Lord's, the ground where he made his electrifying debut six years ago. Steve Smith and all that.\nIt would be good for the series if India won this week. Level at 1-1 is all to play for, 2-0 down is as good as over. The visitors will have to battle history - they have never won in eight visits to Edgbaston spanning 58 years.\nAnother classic incoming?\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. \nBehind this authoritarian curtain, her Congress party government quietly began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book.\nIn Indira Gandhi and the Years That Transformed India, Prof Raghavan shows how Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system - one that would centralise executive power, sideline an \"obstructionist\" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus.\nInspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. \nIt all began, writes Prof Raghavan, in September 1975, when BK Nehru, a seasoned diplomat and a close aide of Gandhi, wrote a letter hailing the Emergency as a \"tour de force of immense courage and power produced by popular support\" and urged Gandhi to seize the moment. \nParliamentary democracy had \"not been able to provide the answer to our needs\", Nehru wrote. In this system the executive was continuously dependent on the support of an elected legislature \"which is looking for popularity and stops any unpleasant measure\".\nWhat India needed, Nehru said, was a directly elected president - freed from parliamentary dependence and capable of taking \"tough, unpleasant and unpopular decisions\" in the national interest, Prof Raghavan writes.\nThe model he pointed to was de Gaulle's France - concentrating power in a strong presidency. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. He even proposed stripping fundamental rights - right to equality or freedom of speech, for example - of their justiciability.\nNehru urged Indira Gandhi to \"make these fundamental changes in the Constitution now when you have two-thirds majority\". His ideas were \"received with rapture\" by the prime minister's secretary PN Dhar. Gandhi then gave Nehru approval to discuss these ideas with her party leaders but said \"very clearly and emphatically\" that he  should not convey the impression that they had the stamp of her approval. \nProf Raghavan writes that the ideas met with enthusiastic support from senior Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram and foreign minister Swaran Singh. The chief minister of Haryana state  was blunt: \"Get rid of this election nonsense. If you ask me just make our sister [Indira Gandhi] President for life and there's no need to do anything else\". M Karunanidhi of Tamil Nadu \u2013 one of two non-Congress chief ministers consulted - was unimpressed.\nWhen Nehru reported back to Gandhi, she remained non-committal, Prof Raghavan writes. She instructed her closest aides to explore the proposals further. \nWhat emerged was a document titled \"A Fresh Look at Our Constitution: Some suggestions\", drafted in secrecy and circulated among trusted advisors. It proposed a president with powers greater than even their American counterpart, including control over judicial appointments and legislation. A new \"Superior Council of Judiciary\", chaired by the president, would interpret \"laws and the Constitution\" - effectively neutering the Supreme Court.\nGandhi sent this document to Dhar, who recognised it \"twisted the Constitution in an ambiguously authoritarian direction\". Congress president DK Barooah tested the waters by publicly calling for a \"thorough re-examination\" of the Constitution at the party's 1975 annual session.\nThe idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal. But its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.\nThe amendment made striking down laws harder by requiring supermajorities of five or seven judges, and aimed to dilute the Constitution's 'basic structure doctrine' that limited parliament's power.\nIt also handed the federal government sweeping authority to deploy armed forces in states, declare region-specific Emergencies, and extend President's Rule - direct federal rule - from six months to a year. It also put election disputes out of the judiciary's reach.\nThis was not yet a presidential system, but it carried its genetic imprint - a powerful executive, marginalised judiciary and weakened checks and balances.  The Statesman newspaper warned that \"by one sure stroke, the amendment tilts the constitutional balance in favour of the parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, Gandhi's loyalists were going all in. Defence minister Bansi Lal urged \"lifelong power\" for her as prime minister, while Congress members in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh unanimously called for a new constituent assembly in October 1976.\n\"The prime minister was taken aback. She decided to snub these moves and hasten the passage of the amendment bill in the parliament,\" writes Prof Raghavan.\nBy December 1976, the bill had been passed by both houses of parliament and ratified by 13 state legislatures and signed into law by the president.\nAfter Gandhi's shock defeat in 1977, the short-lived Janata Party - a patchwork of anti-Gandhi forces - moved quickly to undo the damage. Through the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Amendments, it rolled back key parts of the Forty Second, scrapping authoritarian provisions and restoring democratic checks and balances.\nGandhi was swept back to power in January 1980, after the Janata Party government collapsed due to internal divisions and leadership struggles. Curiously, two years later, prominent voices in the party again mooted the idea of a presidential system.\nIn 1982, with President Sanjiva Reddy's term ending, Gandhi seriously considered stepping down as prime minister to become president of India. \nHer principal secretary later revealed she was \"very serious\" about the move. She was tired of carrying the Congress party on her back and saw the presidency as a way to deliver a \"shock treatment to her party, thereby giving it a new stimulus\".\nUltimately, she backed down. Instead, she elevated Zail Singh, her loyal home minister, to the presidency.\nDespite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system. Did Gandhi, a deeply tactical politician, hold herself back ? Or was there no national appetite for radical change and India's parliamentary system proved sticky?\nThere was a hint of presidential drift in the early 1970s, as India's parliamentary democracy - especially after 1967 - grew more competitive and unstable, marked by fragile coalitions, according to Prof Raghavan. Around this time, voices began suggesting that a presidential system might suit India better. The Emergency became the moment when these ideas crystallised into serious political thinking.\n\"The aim was to reshape the system in ways that immediately strengthened her hold on power. There was no grand long-term design - most of the lasting consequences of her [Gandhi's] rule were likely unintended,\" Prof Raghavan told the BBC.\n\"During the Emergency, her primary goal was short-term: to shield her office from any challenge. The Forty Second Amendment was crafted to ensure that even the judiciary couldn't stand in her way.\"\nThe itch for a presidential system within the Congress never quite faded. As late as April 1984, senior minister Vasant Sathe launched a nationwide debate advocating a shift to presidential governance - even while in power. \nBut six months later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in Delhi, and with her, the conversation abruptly died. India stayed a parliamentary democracy.  ",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "A school principal and an attendant have been arrested in India after allegations that female students were stripped naked to check if they were menstruating after blood stains were found on a toilet wall.\nThe police action came after the mother of one of the \"10 to 15 girls\" who were put through the alleged humiliation lodged a complaint.\nThe incident took place on Tuesday in a village not far from Mumbai city. On Wednesday, parents protested at the school, demanding strict punishment against the authorities.\nIn a video, the school principal is seen arguing with angry parents - she denies that she ordered a strip-search or that it took place.\nSenior police official Milind Shinde told the BBC on Thursday that they were investigating the allegations. The arrested women would be produced in court later in the day, he said.\nThe police complaint names four other teachers and two trustees of the all-girls school in Thane in the western state of Maharashtra. BBC has reached out to the school authorities for a response.\nIn their complaint, police have invoked sections of the law that deal with assault and intent to outrage modesty of women. They have also added sections from the stringent Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act.\nThe parents have alleged that all the students from 5th to 10th classes - who would be between the ages of 10 and 16 - were summoned to a hall by the school principal on Tuesday.\nThere, they were shown photos from the toilet on a projector, including that of a hand stain, and those who had their periods were asked to raise their hands. A teacher collected hand prints of all those who did.\nAt least 10 to 15 girls who said they weren't menstruating were then taken to the toilet, forced to strip and went through an inspection.\nThe child whose mother lodged the police complaint has alleged that her daughter, who didn't have her period, was scolded and asked why she wasn't wearing a sanitary pad. Her hand print was also collected.\nShe said her daughter \"felt very ashamed\" because of what had happened. \nSome of the parents told the BBC that their daughters were traumatised. \n\"The incident raises serious questions about the safety of our children. Our girls are very afraid. The government should take strict action against the school,\" one parent said.\nThe mother of one of the students told BBC Marathi that when confronted, the principal denied everything. \"But the school didn't have an answer when we asked them whether so many girls could be lying,\" she said.\nPeriods have long been a taboo in India where menstruating girls and women are considered impure and excluded from social and religious events.\nAnd incidents of shaming female students have been reported in the past too.\nIn 2017, 70 students were stripped naked at a residential school in Uttar Pradesh by the female warden after she found blood on a bathroom door.\nIn 2020, 68 students living in a college hostel in Gujarat were strip-searched after they stopped reporting their periods to authorities to avoid restrictions which barred them from entering the temple and the kitchen or touching other students.\nAt meal times, they had to sit away from others, and in the classroom, they were expected to sit on the last bench.\nThe regressive ideas are being increasingly challenged by urban educated women, but success has been patchy and women in many parts of the country continue to face discrimination.",

        "article_text": "The Western Indian town of Kolhapur has found itself in an unlikely global spotlight, as thousands of local artisans who hand-craft traditional leather footwear are mounting a collective attack on luxury fashion label Prada for plagiarising their designs without credit.\nThe rhythmic pounding of the hammer in 58-year-old Sadashiv Sanake's dimly lit workshop bears witness to the hard grind behind handcrafting the iconic Kolhapuri leather sandals.\n\"I learnt the craft as a child,\" he tells the BBC. A day's toil goes into making just \"eight to 10 pairs\" of these sandals he says, that retail at a modest $8-10\nBarely 5,000 artisans in Kolhapur are still in the profession \u2013 a cottage industry that struggles to compete in a mechanised world, caught in the funk of dismal working conditions and low wages.\nIt's no surprise then that when Italian luxury brand Prada released a new line of footwear that bore a striking resemblance to the Kolhapuri sandals - but didn't mention the design origins - local artisans were up in arms.\nThe backlash was swift. Social media was flooded with accusations of cultural appropriation, prompting Prada to issue a statement acknowledging the sandals' roots.\nNow local politicians and industry associations have thrown their weight behind the artisans who want better recognition of the craft and its cultural legacy. \nMr Sanake was not aware of Prada's show until the BBC showed him a video of it. When told that that the sandals could retail for hundreds of pounds in luxury markets, he scoffed. \"Do they have gold in them?\" he asked.\nPrada hasn't revealed the price tag but its other sandals retail at between \u00a3600 to \u00a31,000 in the UK as per its website. \nThe earliest records of Kolhapur sandals date back to the 12th Century.\n\"These sandals were originally crafted by members of the marginalised Charmakar (cobbler) community, also known as chamars,\" said Kavita Gagrani, a history professor at the New College in Kolhapur.\nChamar is a pejorative caste term used to describe Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) who work with animal hides.\n\"But in the early 20th Century, the craft flourished when the then ruler of Kolhapur, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj granted royal patronage to this community,\" Ms Gagrani said.\nToday, nearly 100,000 artisans across India are engaged in the trade with an industry worth over $200m, according to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA), a prominent industry trade group.\nYet, most of them continue to work in unorganised setups under dismal conditions.\n\"I was never educated. This is all I know, and I earn about $4-5 a day, depending on the number of orders,\" said 60-year-old Sunita Satpute.\nWomen like her play a critical role, particularly in engraving fine patterns by hand, but are not compensated fairly for their long hours of labour, she said.\nThat's why Sunita's children don't want to continue the craft.\nA short distance away from her workshop lies Kolhapur's famous chappal gully, or sandal lane, a cluster of storefronts - many of them struggling to stay afloat.\n\"Leather has become very expensive and has pushed up our costs,\" said Anil Doipode, one of the first sellers to open a shop here. \nTraditionally, artisans would use cow and buffalo hide to make these sandals. But since 2014, when the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, there have been several reports of vigilantes - self-appointed protesters or activists - cracking down on alleged cow slaughter, sometimes with physical violence. The cow is considered sacred by Hindus.\nIn 2015, Maharashtra state banned the slaughter of cows and the sale and consumption of beef, forcing artisans to rely on buffalo leather sourced from neighbouring states, pushing up their production costs.\nTraditional sellers are also struggling to compete with synthetic copies flooding the market.\n\"Customers want cheaper sandals and can't always tell the difference,\" said Rohit Balkrishna Gavali, a second-generation Kolhapuri sandal seller.\nIndustry experts say the controversy highlights the need for a better institutional framework to protect the rights of artisans.\nIn 2019, the Indian government had awarded Kolhapuri sandals the Geographical Indication (GI) - a mark of authenticity which protects its name and design within India, preventing unauthorised use by outsiders.\nGlobally, however, there is no binding law that stops other countries or brands from aesthetic imitation.\nAishwarya Sandeep, a Mumbai-based advocate, says that India could raise the issue at the World Trade Organization under its TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement, of which it is a signatory.\nBut the system is cumbersome, expensive and often lacks enforceability, both in India and abroad, she adds.\nLalit Gandhi, the president of MCCIA, says his organisation is planning to patent the Kolhapuri sandal design, hoping to create a legal precedent for future cases.\nBut some say real change can only happen when India starts seeing its traditional heritage in a different light. \n\"It's about ethical recognition. India must push for royalty-sharing and co-branding,\" says Ritu Beri, a renowned designer. \"The more we take pride in our culture, the less we will be exploited.\"\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time a global fashion brand has been accused of appropriating Indian handicrafts.\nMany big labels have featured Indian fabrics and embroidery work with little to no artist collaboration. \"Take Chikankari (a delicate hand-embroidery style from the northern Indian city of Lucknow), Ikat (a cloth-dyeing technique), mirror work; they've all been used repeatedly. The artisans remain invisible while brands profit from their inspiration,\" Ms Beri says.\nMr Gandhi, however, says that Prada's endorsement of Kolhapuri sandals could also be beneficial for artisans.\n\"Under their label, the value [of Kolhapuri sandals] is going to increase manifold,\" he says. \"But we want some share of that profit to be passed on to artisans for their betterment.\"\nRohit Balkrishna Gavali, a sandal-seller in Kolhapur, agrees - he has already begun to see the difference.\n\"The design Prada used wasn't even very popular, but now people are asking for it, with clients from Dubai, the US and Qatar\" placing orders, he says.\n\"Sometimes, controversy can help,\" he adds. \"But it would be nice if it also brought respect and better prices for those keeping this tradition alive.\"\nThe issue is unlikely to die down soon.\nFor now, a plea has been filed in a high court, demanding Prada pay damages and compensation to artisans, along with a court-supervised collaboration between the luxury label and artisan associations. \nPrada has told BBC in a statement that it is in talks with the MCCIA on this matter.   \nMr Gandhi, its chief, says a meeting between the two sides is going to take place next week.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Her relatives and supporters have offered $1m (\u00a3735,000) as diyah, or blood money, to be paid to Mahdi's family.\n\"We are still waiting for their pardon or any other demands,\" a member of the Save Nimisha Priya Council told the BBC.\n\"The execution date has been conveyed by the director general of prosecution to jail authorities . We are still trying to save her. But ultimately the family has to agree for pardon,\" Babu John, social activist and member of the council said.\nAn official in India's ministry of external affairs told BBC that they were still trying to confirm the details. \nNimisha Priya had left the southern Indian state of Kerala for Yemen in 2008 to work as a nurse. \nShe was arrested in 2017 after Mahdi's body was discovered. The 34-year-old is presently lodged in Sanaa central jail in the capital of Yemen.\nShe was charged with killing Mahdi by giving him an \"overdose of sedatives\" and allegedly chopping up his body.\nNimisha denied the allegations. In court, her lawyer argued that Mahdi physically tortured her, snatched all her money, seized her passport and even threatened her with a gun.\nHe said she had tried to anaesthetise Mahdi just to retrieve her passport from him, but that the dose was accidentally increased.\nIn 2020, a local court sentenced her to death. Her family challenged the decision in Yemen's Supreme Court, but their appeal was rejected in 2023.\nIn early January, Mahdi al-Mashat, president of the rebel Houthis' Supreme Political Council, approved her execution.\nYemen's Islamic judicial system, known as Sharia, offer her one last ray  of hope - securing a pardon from the victim's family by paying blood money to them.\nNimisha's mother, a poor domestic helper from Kerala, has been in Yemen since April 2024 in a last-ditch effort to save her. \nShe has nominated Samuel Jerome, a Yemen-based social worker, to negotiate with Mahdi's family.  \nA lobby group called Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council has been raising money by crowdfunding for the purpose and Mr Jerome has said that $1m has been offered to Mahdi's family.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "India's Smriti Mandhana is the number one ranked batter in ODIs, with Nat Sciver-Brunt third\nEngland's new era under head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt started with a ruthless clean sweep against the West Indies, but their first real challenge begins on Saturday, with the first of five T20s against India taking place at Trent Bridge. \nThey are followed by three one-day internationals, which will be hugely important in preparation for the World Cup which is being hosted by India in the autumn. \nSuch is the anticipation for the series, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) commissioned 'Bend it Like Beckham' director Gurinder Chadha to direct a promotional trailer for the ongoing men's, women's and mixed disability series in which India face England in all three.\nIndia are ranked third in the world in both white-ball formats with England in second, and the introduction of the Women's Premier League (WPL) has significantly improved their strength in depth and experience of playing in front of packed crowds under pressure. \nBBC Sport looks at the players to watch and the storylines to keep an eye out for.\nSciver-Brunt and India batter Smriti Mandhana are two of the game's biggest icons - at the first auction for the WPL in 2023, the England all-rounder sold for about \u00a3320,000 and the elegant India left-hander was the most expensive pick at \u00a3340,000.\nMandhana is the world's top-ranked batter in ODIs with Sciver-Brunt in third, while they are fourth and ninth in T20s respectively. \nTheir individual successes could go a long way in defining the series. England win 79% of their ODIs if Sciver-Brunt passes 50, and that figure rises to 82% in T20s.\nIndia rely a little more on Mandhana in the longer format with a win percentage of 76% if she scores a half-century, compared to 60% in T20s. \nIn general, India are likely to present a bigger challenge to England with the bat as their bowling looks depleted without the experience and prolific swing of the injured Renuka Singh Thakur.\nIn their warm-ups, they have conceded 353-5 to England's Select XI in a 50-over match and 194-8 in the T20, eventually losing both.\nMandhana, named Wisden's leading women's cricketer in the world for 2024, has an excellent record against England, averaging 51.68 in ODIs and a fraction over 38 in T20s, but there are areas of weakness for the bowlers to target.\nIn T20s, England's seamers should target Mandhana on the stumps early in her innings with movement into the left-hander - she averages 23 against in-swing compared to 40 against balls that swing away from her. \nCharlie Dean and Alice Capsey should also take note as off-spin is the best match-up to Mandhana. Since 2022, she averages 24 with a strike-rate of 108 - her lowest average and strike-rate against any type of bowling. \nSophie Ecclestone took 4-12 as Lancashire won the T20 Women's County Cup final\nThe return of Ecclestone, the world's number one bowler in ODIs and ranked fourth in T20s, has dominated the build-up to the series as she returns to the England fold for the first time since the Ashes. \nThe left-arm spinner made headlines for her off-field behaviour in Australia when she refused a TV interview with former team-mate turned pundit Alex Hartley, who had criticised the team's fitness after the T20 World Cup.\nShe was then left out of Edwards' first squads for the West Indies series, having missed the start of Lancashire's season with a knee injury. England insisted her absence was due to a lack of game time and to recover from the niggle, though Ecclestone played for her county on the same day the squad was announced.\nIt was confirmed at the beginning of this month that Ecclestone would take a break from county cricket to \"prioritise her wellbeing\" and to manage a quad problem, before Edwards named her in the squad to face India. \n\"This is the best preparation for Sophie, to be ready for India,\" Edwards said after the final ODI against West Indies, when asked about her previous statements that she wanted to pick players based on form in domestic cricket. \n\"She has been playing, she has performed really well, including winning the T20 Cup with Lancashire, so I'm happy with how she is tracking.\" \nDespite a difficult period for England, Ecclestone's numbers have never dropped - in 2024 she took 24 wickets in T20s, averaging 14.87 with an economy rate of just 5.59, and 13 scalps in ODIs at a remarkable average of 7.23.\nBut with fellow left-armer Smith impressing against West Indies, including a five-for on ODI debut - alongside Edwards' insistence that nobody's place in the side is guaranteed - it is unlikely Ecclestone has ever been under pressure like this before.\nOne of England's most significant weaknesses over the past couple of years has been their ability against spin, and an apparent lack of strategy against it. \nThough West Indies' bowling line-up was unthreatening and England's batters dominated throughout, there were some suggestions this is still a concern and will be tested both in this upcoming series, and more significantly in the World Cup where conditions will suit the spinners.\nIn the T20s, West Indies opened with Zaida James' spin and she removed Danni Wyatt-Hodge twice with the first ball of the match, while Hayley Matthews took 3-32 in the third T20 and 2-49 in the first ODI. \nThough England drew the 2023 Ashes at home, 23 wickets fell to off-spinner Ash Gardner and a surprise T20 series defeat by Sri Lanka followed as the tourists wisely packed their side with slow bowlers. \nLeg-spinner Alana King then matched Gardner's tally at the start of this year as England lost 40 wickets to spin in the series at an average of just 12.3. \nThere is no doubt India will be aware of this and it works to their advantage, too - since 2023, 58% of their deliveries bowled in both white-ball formats have been from spinners, and they have accounted for 62% of their wickets in T20s and 65% in ODIs.\nDeepti Sharma's run out of Charlie Dean sealed a 3-0 ODI series win for India in 2022\nIndia's last tour of England in 2022 saw the visitors claim a 3-0 clean sweep in the ODIs, with Sciver-Brunt and then-captain Heather Knight's absences sorely felt, but it was the final act of the series at Lord's which saw it end in controversy. \nIn a thrilling finale, England needed 17 runs to win while India required just one wicket when spinner Deepti Sharma ran out Dean on 47 at the non-striker's end - often referred to as a 'Mankad'. \nDean was in tears, stand-in captain Amy Jones said she was \"not a fan\" while India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur backed her bowler. \nDean jokingly re-enacted the dismissal in a game for Southern Vipers the following day and the pair have since played together for London Spirit, winning The Hundred last year.\nBut at Lord's on 19 July, their reunion will inevitably take the spotlight. \n\"It's in the laws, it happens, so unless the laws change and become a little bit more obvious in terms of what counts and what doesn't, then it's going to keep happening,\" said England batter Tammy Beaumont. \n\"We have to get on board with that unfortunately. I'm sure externally there will be plenty of replays but we'll be keeping our bats behind the line for sure.\n\"We'll play in a competitive spirit as we always do against India, but definitely we will be respectful to all their players too.\"\nFollow ball by ball commentary of every match of India's tour of England on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app. TV highlights will be available on iPlayer and the Red Button.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nTest matches before final day being played at 'snail's pace' - analysis\nIt has become an unwanted story of England's series against India.\nSlow over-rates. A topic frequently discussed but that never goes away.\nJust 72.3 overs were bowled on day two of the third Test at Lord's.\nThat means, including the necessary time taken for a change of innings, 15 overs were lost from the match not because of rain or bad light but because of the slowness of play.\nThe stoppages are undoubtedly a poor look for the sport but what has changed, what are the rules, does it matter and what can be done?\nIn a five-day Test, 90 overs are scheduled for each day.\nTo prevent teams tactically wasting time to ensure a draw all of the overs must be bowled on the fifth day barring interruptions for the weather but, on the previous days, the overs must be fitted into the six hours of play, with an extra half an hour made available at the end of the day.\nWhile time can be made up for overs lost to the weather, there is no such provision when the reason is simply slow play. If overs are not bowled in that time they are lost from the match.\nThere are some penalties already in place in the International Cricket Council's playing conditions but they have limited impact.\nAn umpire can, after an initial warning, award five penalty runs to an opposition if one team is deemed to be wasting time. This rule has never been enforced in Test cricket.\nA stop clock was also introduced last month where a timer counts down from 60 seconds between overs. Again, five penalty runs can be awarded here but, despite warnings during the first two Tests, neither captain was punished.\nMore common are fines against captains and, in the World Test Championship (WTC) league phase, points deductions.\nAt the end of a WTC match various caveats are taken into accounts, such as injuries and umpire reviews, and a calculation is made as to how far behind the required over-rate a team was. \nThe regulations state: \"A team will have one point deducted from its points total for each penalty over it incurs.\"\nEngland were docked 22 points during the 2023-25 cycle. Captain Ben Stokes has pointed out his team are at a disadvantage because pace bowlers, with their longer run-ups, bowl more overs in the UK than other countries where spin plays a greater part.\nThe over-rate debate is not new. \nThe number of overs bowled per hour has dropped steadily throughout the history of Test cricket, in part down to developments in the game such as umpire reviews, boundary checks, concussion protocol and TV advert breaks.\nPrior to World War Two the average over rate was around 21 per hour. That dropped to 18 between 1945 and 1974, 14.3 from 1975 to 1999 and 14 since 2000.\nThings have taken a further turn in this series. The over-rate across the first two Tests was 13.3 per hour with 39 overs lost in the first Test and 19 in the second.\nA major factor has been the ball. Both teams have repeatedly asked for the ball to be changed because it has gone soft and out of shape. This has led to delays to allow umpires to check the shape and possibly replace the ball.\nThere have been other lengthy breaks too. \nOn day two at Lord's the first drinks break lasted around six minutes and 20 seconds, rather than the standard four.\nGiven the high temperatures in London, there have been regular unscheduled drinks breaks and pauses for batters to change their gloves. \nThere have been a number of breaks for minor injury treatment too.\nBoth England batter Joe Root and India bowler Jasprit Bumrah were asked about the issue after the second day's play.\nRoot suggested teams should only be allowed three attempts to change the ball per innings to save some time.\n\"I don't want to get myself in trouble by trying to rewrite the thing but that's one way of policing the ball thing,\" Root said. \n\"In terms of over rates, it can be quite difficult on a day like today. \n\"We're not used to this, are we? Thirty [degrees] in England feels like 45 elsewhere. But I guess just try and keep on top of it as much as you can.\"\nA point of debate is whether rushing through the overs would diminish the quality of play. Although time was lost, Friday's play was action-packed.\nThere are also fewer draws in Tests now than ever before, meaning a result is still found despite the overs lost.\n\"It's hot out there,\" said Bumrah. \"It's tough on the bowlers. \n\"Sometimes you have to take your time because you don't want your quality to be compromised. You don't want to be too rushed.\"\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: \nWhen it gets to the fifth day you have to bowl the 90 overs. I have no idea why on days one, two, three, or four we see the game played at a snail's pace. \nOn day five when the players and umpires know 90 have to be bowled they are running around, there won't be as many unofficial drinks breaks. \nI would make it simple. You have to bowl 90 overs in a day regardless of the time.\nBBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew: \nI have spent 30 years banging on about over-rates. On the face of it is it boring but it is actually really important because it is just a terrible look. \nYou cannot have up to 15 overs not being bowled. It is totally unacceptable. \nIt is like going to the cinema, watching Pearl and Dean and then the lights go on and you are kicked out. Fines don't work. \nNow teams have time allowed for breaks but they should be penalised on that. There should be a stop clock for drinks breaks. Every time someone comes on to the field to bring gloves or drinks on a clock should start and that counts against that team.\nThen you have to impose penalty runs. It is the only currency players understand.\nTest Match Special statistician Andy Zaltzman:\nThe general play in Test cricket is really good but surely it would be improved by having more of it per day.\nThere is a clock between overs now and the only problem is players completely ignore it. \nYou need an in-game penalty of runs against the batting or bowling side if they are obviously wasting time, maybe with a green or yellow card warning system.\nFormer England captain Sir Alastair Cook: \nThe issue has been going on for years. \nI am not blaming the players. It is time for the ICC and the umpires to step in. The speed of play is their responsibility. Drinks breaks need to be shorter.\nAs players you will always push the boundaries. A 10:30 start would allow another half an hour but would just add to the overall issue. \nAs a captain the last thing you are worried about is the speed of play. You are aware of it because you get fined but the game is far more important for you. It is about winning that moment.\nBBC cricket commentator Simon Mann:\nWe need a proper penalty to concentrate players' minds. You could have a run penalty but it is a little artificial. \nI would calculate how many overs the batting or bowling side is down - it is not just the bowling side that wastes time - and next time they bowl take a fielder off for two, three or five overs. \nFormer England bowler Steven Finn:\nA run penalty would be better than a monetary fine. The problem is there are quite a lot of things that aren't the fault of the bowling team at all - gloves changed too frequently, treatment for minor injuries.\nIt is more complicated than simply punishing the bowling team and I wouldn't want the quality of cricket to be diminished by rushing through too much.\nBBC cricket presenter and commentator Isa Guha:\nSlow over-rates have been a problem for a long time in Test cricket and I feel sorry for the spectators who pay good money and feel like they are missing out on action they have paid for. \nWe can be a bit more flexible with the hours of play and start half an hour earlier the following day to complete overs lost the previous day. We are all here as broadcasters and it would be straightforward to communicate that to the spectators. That would be my solution.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Its crew included Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to have gone to space.\nHis trip came 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma flew aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - was a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. \nOn Monday, ISS posted on X that the Ax-4 crew had taken their places in the spacecraft and its hatches had been closed. The undocking of the craft - when it separated from the ISS - was broadcast live. \nOn Tuesday morning, Axiom Space said the craft would announce its arrival with a brief sonic boom before splashing down in the ocean off the coast of California, after which a vessel would pick it up. The crew would then be flown out to land in a helicopter.\nIn his farewell address from aboard the ISS on Sunday, the Indian astronaut said India's journey in space exploration may be tough, but it has begun.\n\"It has been an incredible journey. Even though now it is coming to an end, for you and me there is a long way to go. The journey of our human space mission is very long and difficult. But if we are determined, even the stars are attainable.\"\nHe referred to India's first man in space cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma famously quoting from a 1924 Urdu song \"Sare jahan se achcha\" to say \"India looked better than the rest of the world\".\n\"Even today we want to know how it looks from space. I'll tell you. From space, today's India looks ambitious. It looks fearless. It looks confident. It looks proud. And so, I can once again say that today's India still looks better than the rest of the world,\" Group Captain Shukla said. \nAx-4, which was originally expected to spend two weeks on the ISS, ended up staying a few days longer. During their stay, Axiom Space said the crew conducted 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nIsro, which had paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla on Ax-4 and his training, has said the hands-on experience he gains during his trip to the ISS will help India in its human space flights.\nIsro has announced plans to launch Gaganyaan - the country's first-ever human space flight in 2027 - and has ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nGroup Captain Shukla is among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on Gaganyaan.\nBorn on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Shukla joined the air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.\nHe has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks and has more than 2,000 hours of flying experience.\nBefore flying into space, he described the past year as \"nothing short of transformative\".\n\"It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts. I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,\" he had said. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "A black box has been found at the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India's civil aviation minister said on Friday. \nThe flight data recorder was recovered within 28 hours by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu confirmed. \nAll but one of the 242 people on the London-bound flight died when it crashed into a residential area less than 60 seconds after take-off on Thursday. An official told the BBC that at least eight people on the ground were also killed.\n\"The [recovery of the black box] marks an important step forward in the investigation\" and will \"significantly aid the inquiry\" into the disaster, Mr Kinjarapu said.\nPlanes usually carry two black boxes - small but tough electronic data recorders. \nOne records flight data, such as altitude and speed. The other records sound from the cockpit, so investigators can hear what the pilots are saying and listen for any unusual noises.\nAAIB is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and UK. Boeing's chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said the company was supporting the investigation. \nAir India said there were 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft when it crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT). \nIt was scheduled to land at London's Gatwick airport at 18:25 BST.\nOn Friday, the wreckage was still scattered across the crash site, including the blackened wing of the plane, with large pieces of the aircraft stuck in buildings.\nInvestigators arrived at the scene and crowds were moved further away from the wreckage. \nA doctor told the BBC that they are relying on DNA from relatives to identify the victims. A police official at the post-mortem room told the BBC that the remains of six people had been released to families so far, as their relatives were able to identify them based on facial features.\nThe sole survivor of the crash, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A on the flight, is still recovering in hospital. \n\"I still cannot believe how I made it out alive,\" he told India's state broadcaster DD News on Thursday.\n\"At first, I thought I was going to die. I managed to open my eyes, unfastened my seat belt and tried to exit the plane.\"\nMr Ramesh, 40, who sustained burn injuries on his left hand, said he saw the aircraft crew and its passengers die in front of his eyes.\nMeanwhile, desperate families are still waiting for news of their relatives. \nImtiaz Ali, whose brother Javed and his family were on the flight, said that until he sees his brother's body, he will not believe he has died.\n\"If I get sad and start crying, then I'll be uncontrollable,\" he told the BBC. \n\"No-one will be able to stop me... my heart might burst.\" \nThe plane crashed in a residential area called Meghani Nagar and, even though it had just taken off, the impact was severe. Wreckage spread over 200m (656ft), according to responders. \nIt is still unclear exactly how many were killed on the ground, but the BBC has been told that at least eight people, who were not on the aircraft, have died. \nDr Minakshi Parikh, the dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, said four of their students died as the plane crashed into buildings on the campus.\n\"There were also four relatives of our doctors who were on the campus when the aircraft crashed - they too were killed,\" Dr Parikh said.\n\"We are relying only on DNA matching to identify them and it is something where we simply cannot rush or afford mistakes. \n\"We are working with sincerity. We want relatives to understand, and be a bit patient. We want to hand over [the bodies] as soon as possible.\" \nOn Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent around 20 minutes at the site of the plane crash. \nHe did not speak to reporters afterwards but a video posted on his YouTube channel showed him walking around the site and inspecting the debris.\nModi also visited the location of a now-viral image that shows the tail of the crashed plane lodged in a building. \nEarlier on Friday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson also went to the crash site, later describing the visit as \"deeply moving\".\nAccording to data by tracking website, Flightradar24, the Boeing Dreamliner 787-8 had completed more than 700 flights in the year leading up to the Thursday's disaster. \nThe Air India plane was 11 years old and its most common routes included flights between Mumbai and Dubai, as well as the capital New Delhi and European destinations such as Milan, Paris and Amsterdam.\nThe plane had operated 25 flights from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick in the past two years.",

        "article_text": "\"Let me tell you a secret. Your nana (grandfather) helped Jewish families escape the Nazis.\"\nThat single sentence from his mother set Vinay Gupta off on a journey into his grandfather's past. What he unearthed was a tale more gripping than fiction: a little-known act of heroism by an Indian businessman who risked everything to save strangers in Europe's darkest hour.\nThis wasn't just compassion; it was logistics, risk, and resolve. Back in India, Kundanlal set up a businesses to employ Jews, built homes to house them - only to watch the British declare them as \"enemy aliens\" and detain them once World War Two broke out.\nKundanlal's life reads like an epic: a poor boy from Ludhiana, married at 13, who sold everything from timber and salt to lab gear and bullock-cart wheels. He also ran a clothing business and a matchstick factory. He topped his class in Lahore - joining the colonial civil service at 22, only to resign from it all to participate in the freedom movement and a life of building factories.\nHe shook hands with Indian independence leader and later its first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and crossed paths with actress Devika Rani on a steamer to Europe.\nIn A Rescue In Vienna, a family memoir, Gupta uncovers his grandfather's  extraordinary Indian rescue on foreign soil - pieced together through family letters, survivor interviews, and historical records.\nIn the shadow of Hitler's 1938 annexation of Austria, Kundanlal, a machine tool manufacturer from Ludhiana city in the northern state of Punjab, quietly offered Jewish professionals jobs in India to get them life-saving visas. He offered work,  provided livelihood and build homes for those families in India. \nKundanlal rescued five families.\nFritz Weiss, a 30-year-old Jewish lawyer, was hiding in a hospital, feigning illness. Kundanlal was also in the same hospital to get treatment for an illness. \nAfter Nazis forced Weiss to clean the streets outside his own home, Kundanlal handed him a lifeline: a job offer at the fictitious \"Kundan Agencies.\" It got him a visa to India.\nAlfred Wachsler, a master woodworker, met Kundanlal while bringing his pregnant wife for tests. Promised a future in furniture and a sponsor for emigration, his family became one of the Jewish households to reach India between January 1938 and February 1939. \nHans Losch, a textile technician, answered Kundanlal's advert in an Austrian paper for skilled workers. Offered a managerial role at the imaginary \"Kundan Cloth Mills\" in Ludhiana - with housing, profit share, and safe passage - he seized the chance to start over.\nAlfred Schafranek, once owner of a 50-employee plywood factory, pitched his skills to Kundanlal and was offered a role in building India's most modern plywood unit. His entire family, including his mechanic brother Siegfried, was rescued.\nAnd Siegmund Retter, a machine tools businessman, was among the first Kundanlal approached. As his business collapsed under Nazi rule, Kundanlal began arranging his move to India to start again.\nIt all began with a hospital bed in Vienna. \nStruggling with diabetes and hemorrhoids, Kundanlal, then 45, sought new treatments and read about a specialist in Vienna. In 1938, while recovering from surgery there, he met Lucy and Alfred Wachsler, a young couple expecting their first child. From them, he learned of rising antisemitic violence and the destruction of Jewish lives. \nOver the next few months, he met other men. Encouraged by this success, Kundanlal placed newspaper adverts seeking skilled workers willing to relocate to India. Among the respondents were Wachsler, Losch, Schafranek and Retter. Kundanlal offered each a job, financial guarantees, and support to secure Indian visas.\n\"A striking aspect of all of Kundanlal's elaborate scheming on behalf of these families was how close mouthed he remained, keeping up appearances of technology transfer to India until the very end,\" Gupta writes. \n\"He did not share his intent or plans with any Indian or British officials. His family learned of his plans only when he returned home months later.\" \nIn October 1938, Losch became the first of Kundanlal's recruits to arrive in Ludhiana. \nHe was welcomed into Kundanlal's home - but found little comfort in the quiet town, writes Gupta. With no Jewish community, no cultural life, and a struggling cloth mill, Losch left within weeks for Bombay (now Mumbai), citing poor working conditions and little chance of profit. He never returned.\nWeiss lasted even less - just under two months. The company created for him, Kundan Agencies, never took off. He soon moved to Bombay, found work in flooring, and by 1947 had relocated to England. \nDespite their departures, Kundanlal bore no resentment, writes Gupta.\n\"My aunt told me that on the contrary, Kundanlal had been embarrassed that he could not provide a lifestyle and social environment more suited to Vienna, and felt that if he had, the two men may have stayed on in Ludhiana.\" \nNot all stories ended this way.\nAlfred and Lucy Wachsler, with their infant son, arrived by sea, rail, and road - finally stepping off the train at Ludhiana. \nThey moved into a spacious home Kundanlal built for them next door to another, prepared for the Schafraneks. Alfred quickly set up a furniture workshop, using Burmese teak and local Sikh labour to craft elegant dining sets - one of which still survives in the author's family.\nIn March 1939, Alfred Schafranek, his brother Siegfried, and their families arrived from Austria. They launched one of India's earliest plywood factories in a shed behind the two homes. \nDriven and exacting, Alfred pushed untrained workers hard, determined to build something lasting. Gupta writes, the work was intense, the Punjab heat unfamiliar, and the isolation palpable - especially for the women, confined mostly to domestic life.\nAs the months passed in Ludhiana, the initial relief gave way to boredom. \nThe men worked long hours, while the women, limited by language and isolation, kept to household routines. \nIn September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland. Days later, Britain declared war on Germany - the British parliament pulled India into the conflict. Over 2.5 million Indians would serve in the war, 87,000 never returned.\nIn Ludhiana, the reality of war hit fast. \nBy 1940, new policies ordered all German nationals - Jewish or not - into internment camps. \nThe Wachsler and Schafranek families were forcibly relocated to the Purandhar Internment Camp near Poona (now Pune), housed in bare barracks with kerosene lamps and minimal comforts. They had committed no crime - only carried the wrong passport.\nEventually, release became possible - if they could find paid work. \nAlfred and Siegfried Schafranek secured roles managing a new plywood business in Bangalore and moved there with their families, starting all over again. The Wachsler family left the camp in 1942 after Alfred found a job in Karachi. The two families never met again.\nPurandhar Camp closed in 1946, nearly a year after the war ended. \nIn 1948, Alfred Wachsler's cousin sponsored US refugee visas for the family. That October, they flew out of Karachi, never to return to India. The Schafraneks relocated to Australia in 1947 after a successful plywood venture in Bangalore.\nWhile researching the book, Gupta met Alex Wachsler - whose father, Alfred, had also built the Burmese teak desk Kundanlal once used in his tiny 120 sq ft office. (Alfred died in 1973.)\n\"Despite living in US since the age of 10, and now into his eighties, Alex Wachsler still pines for his life in India, eats at Indian restaurants, delights in meeting Indians and surprises them with his knowledge of Urdu,\" writes Gupta.\nBack in Ludhiana, Kundanlal opened a school for his daughters at home, soon expanding it into one of Punjab's oldest schools - still running today with 900 students.

        "article_text": "In Manhattan's West Village, where culinary trends can change with the seasons, Chef Vijay Kumar is shaping a quiet revolution. \nHis 2025 James Beard Award win for Best Chef: New York State this month is more than just personal recognition - it marks a cultural inflection point. \nChennai-based culinary historian Rakesh Raghunathan says: \"Following in the footsteps of fellow Tamil-origin recipients like Raghavan Iyer and Padma Lakshmi, Vijay Kumar's recognition reflects a growing momentum for south Indian voices on the global culinary stage\". \n\"Tamil cuisine -  along with Sri Lankan Tamil and other south Indian regional traditions - is increasingly being embraced by global diners as something refined, rich, and deeply rooted in culture.\"\nBorn in the small farming village of Natham in southern Tamil Nadu, the 44-year-old Kumar has always cooked from memory - of forests and foraging, firewood stoves and his mother and grandmother serving meals made from scratch for the family.\nWhen he took the stage at the JB awards ceremony, he said \"the food I grew up on, the food made with care, with fire, with soul is now taking the main stage\". It was a moment of deep emotion and cultural pride for Kumar. \n\"There is no such thing as a poor person's food, or a rich person's food. It's food. It's powerful. And the real luxury is to be able to connect with each other around the dinner table.\"\nFor Kumar, the win is a personal milestone but also a powerful act of visibility. \n\"When I started cooking, I never thought a dark-skinned boy from Tamil Nadu could make it to a room like this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. It was therefore important for him to wear veshti, the traditional Tamil attire for men, for the black-tie James Beard ceremony as a nod to his roots.\nRecently, Kumar was trolled by a pair of influencers in New York. Quick to rise to his defence was Padma Lakshmi, cookbook author and culinary ambassador, who called the influencers out for their cultural insensitivity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Lakshmi said \"Vijay's story is important not just for south Indian food but also as a story of someone who grew up with humble means and cooked with limited resources.\" \n\"This resourcefulness has not only propelled his work ethic but enhanced his sense of flavour, ingredients and sense of the world. He is a beacon of hope to young people all over the world that if you trust and develop your senses and skills, you can go far in a creative career.\"\nKumar's journey wasn't smooth to start with. \nUnable to afford engineering school in the big city, he chose culinary school instead - beginning his journey at Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai, cooking his way through cruise ships and kitchens, and eventually finding his promised land in America, working at Dosa in San Francisco. \nHis real breakthrough came when he partnered with Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya of Unapologetic Foods, a New York restaurant group, to open Semma - a Tamil slang word for \"fantastic\" in 2021.\nThe trio found a \"shared sense of wanting to honour our heritage, to tell the world who we really are through our cuisine\". \n\"At that moment, it wasn't just about food, it was about identity,\" Mazumdar told the BBC. \"For too long, Indian food in the US has lived under the veil of a manufactured, watered-down north-western lens. With Semma, we set out to pull back that curtain and share something more honest.\"\nKumar jumped at the opportunity to share his cuisine with the world. \"His eyes lit up when we started talking about the food we grew up eating, and that kind of food rarely makes it to restaurant menus,\" recalls Mazumdar.\nKumar's strength lies in serving authentic village food that is seasonal, hyper-local, and built entirely from scratch. His farm-to-table approach, he says, was to cook the way \"my mother and grandmother did\". Semma, he adds, is a celebration of that simplicity.\nThat simplicity resonates. \nSemma's menu defies the clich\u00e9s that often define Indian food abroad. There's no butter chicken or naan here and Kumar's epiphany came with an unlikely encounter: French escargot. \nAs a child, on days when rice was scarce, he would forage with his family for snails in the paddy fields, which would be cooked in a savoury tamarind sauce. Kumar admitted that he was ashamed of it as a boy as it \"felt like food born of poverty - until I saw the pride with which the French serve escargot\". \nToday, the dish, nathai pirattal, sits proudly on Semma's menu, reimagined not as a memory of scarcity, but as a symbol of resilience and cultural pride. \nSemma's menu - pepper rasam, tamarind crab, banana flower vadai, the ubiquitous dosa - offer an emotional connection for many diaspora diners, and a revelation for first-timers.\nKumar's intention to bring village-style Tamil food and showcase it in upscale spots and in the cut-throat New York restaurant space has won a long line of admirers. \nThere's depth, regionality and a powerful emotional connection in this food. \nThe cocktails are a nod to Tamil film stars like Rajnikanth and Silk Smitha, and the d\u00e9cor channels Chennai's warmth. Even the kitchen is a space of intention - cooks are asked to prepare food with \"gratitude and mindfulness\".\n\"I invited him to curate a black-tie gala dinner for 650 guests at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles, and he made us all proud. A year later, people still talk about how incredible the food was,\" says Lakshmi, applauding Kumar's gift for bringing regional Indian cuisine to the most glamorous platforms.\nThe awards and accolades feel like a natural progression of his journey. Semma is the first New York restaurant serving only south Indian cuisine to win a Michelin star and topped The New York Times's list for top 100 restaurants. And now the JBA for Kumar.\nIn many ways, Kumar is not just serving food - he is serving memory, pride and a quiet revolution. \nHis James Beard win is a recognition of his talent, but also an affirmation that regional Indian cuisine, with its bold spices and soulful simplicity, belongs at the centre of the global table.\nKumar's win has piqued the \"curiosity of young people from all over the Indian diaspora and instilled a greater pride in our food ways\", says Lakshmi. \"This will be his greatest legacy.\"\nAdds Mazumdar, \"This win is a signal that regionality matters, and that our stories and our roots have value on the world stage.\"",

        "article_text": "Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.\nJust seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to \"cut-off\" is a move typically done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power.\nAir India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters. \nInvestigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after take-off. The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data about 50 seconds in, according to the FlightRadar24 website.\nThe preliminary report from the investigation - led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - raises several questions.\nInvestigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they're highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps. \n\"It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,\" a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.\nThat's what makes the Air India case stand out.\nIf one of the pilots was responsible for shutting down the switches, intentionally or not, it \"does beg the question: why\", said Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University.\n\"Was it intentional, or the result of confusion? That seems unlikely, as the pilots reported nothing unusual. \n\"In many cockpit emergencies, pilots may press the wrong buttons or make incorrect selections - but there was no indication of such a situation here, nor any discussion suggesting that the fuel switches were selected by mistake,\" he said.\n\"This kind of error doesn't typically happen without some evident issue.\"\nPeter Goelz, a former managing director of the US's NTSB, said: \"The finding is very disturbing - that a pilot has shut off the fuel switch within seconds of flying.\"\n\"There's likely much more on the cockpit voice recorder than what's been shared. A lone remark like 'why did you cut off the switches' isn't enough,\" he said.\n\"The new details suggest someone in the cockpit shut those valves. The question is, who, and why? Both switches were turned off and then restarted within seconds. \n\"The voice recorder will reveal more: was the flying pilot trying to restart the engines, or the monitoring one?\"\nInvestigators believe the cockpit voice recorder - with audio from pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds - holds the key to this puzzle.\n\"They haven't identified the voices yet, which is crucial. Typically, when the voice recorder is reviewed, people familiar with the pilots are present to help match voices. As of now, we still don't know which pilot turned the switches off and back on,\" said Mr Goelz.\nIn short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed.\nThey also say this underscores the need for cockpit video recorders, as recommended by the NTSB. An over-the-shoulder view would show whose hand was on the cut-off switch. \nBefore boarding Flight 171, both pilots and crew had passed breathalyser tests and had been cleared fit to fly, the report says. The pilots, based in Mumbai, had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had adequate rest.\nBut investigators are also zeroing in on what they describe is an interesting point in the report.\nIt says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nWhile the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.\nThe same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8 aircraft, including Air India's VT-ANB which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory, Air India did not perform the recommended inspections. \nMr Pruchnicki said he's wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.\n\"What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut the fuel supply? When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens? Could the switch just flip itself to off and shut down the engine? If that's the case, it's a really serious issue. If not, that also needs to be explained,\" he said.\nOthers, however, aren't convinced this is a key issue.\n\"I haven't heard of this which appears to be a low-profile FAA issuance. Nor have I heard any complaints [about the fuel switches] from pilots - who are usually quick to speak up. It's worth examining since it's mentioned, but it may just be a distraction,\" said Mr Goelz.\nCapt Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), wonders whether the switches tripped because of a problem with the plane's electronic control unit.\n\"Can the fuel cut-off switches be triggered electronically by the plane's electronic control unit without movement by the pilot? If the fuel cut-off switches tripped electronically, then it's a cause for concern,\" he told the BBC.\nThe report says fuel samples from the refuelling tanks were \"satisfactory\". Experts had earlier suggested fuel contamination as a possible cause of the dual engine failure. Notably, no advisory has been issued for the Boeing 787 or its GE GEnx-1B engines, with mechanical failure ruled out for now pending further investigation.\nIt also said that the aircraft's Ram Air Turbine (RAT) had deployed - a clear sign of a major systems failure - and the landing gear was found in \"down position\" or not retracted.\nThe RAT, a small propeller that extends from the underside of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, acts as an emergency backup generator. It automatically deploys in flight when both engines lose power or if all three hydraulic systems register critically low pressure, supplying limited power to keep essential flight systems operational.\n\"The deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) strongly supports the conclusion that both engines had failed,\" Mr Pruchnicki said.\nA Boeing 787 pilot explained why he thought the landing gear was not retracted.\n\"These days, every time I take off in a 787, I notice the landing gear retraction process closely. By the time the gear handle is pulled, we're already at about 200ft (60.9m), and the entire gear retraction process completes by around 400ft - roughly eight seconds in total, thanks to the aircraft's high-pressure hydraulic system.\" \nThe pilot believes the one flying had no time to think.\n\"When both engines fail and the aircraft starts going down, the reaction goes beyond just being startled - you go numb. In that moment, landing gear isn't your focus. Your mind is on one thing: the flight path. Where can I put this aircraft down safely? And in this case, there simply wasn't enough altitude to work with.\"\nInvestigators say the crew tried to recover, but it happened too fast.\n\"The engines were switched off and then back on. The pilots realised the engines were losing thrust - likely restarting the left one first, followed by the right,\" said Mr  Pruchnicki.\n\"But the right engine didn't have enough time to spool back up, and the thrust was insufficient. Both were eventually set to \"run\", but with the left shut down first and the right too late to recover, it was simply too little, too late.\"\nFamilies and friends of the crash victims had been anxiously awaiting the findings of the preliminary report.\nWhen the report was finally released early on Saturday in India, Imtiyaz Ali, who lost his brother, sister-in-law, and their two young children - read it carefully, only to be disappointed by what he said \"reads like a product description\".\n\"Other than the pilots' final conversation, there's nothing in it that really points to what caused the crash.\"\nHe said he hoped more details would be made public in the months to come.\n\"This matters to us. We want to know exactly what happened. It won't change anything for us now, we continue grieving - just as we have since that day. \n\"But at least we'll have some answers,\" Ali said.",

A much fuller picture will come once the plane's black boxes - the electronic recording devices that store vital flight information - have been recovered.\nVarious theories have been posited as to what could have caused the crash in Ahmedabad, but one pilot I spoke to said that nowadays it's rare for a manufacturer fault to cause a fatal incident. \nBarring the very notable exception of the Boeing 737 Max crashes, he said, most were down to human error in the cockpit.\nIt's also important to remember that when you fly commercially, you will almost always either be on a Boeing or an Airbus model as the plane-making industry operates as an effective duopoly.\nEven so, Boeing has found its name associated with yet another tragic aviation incident.\nChief executive Kelly Ortberg said the firm's \"deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of the passengers and crew\" on the flight, and that Boeing would support the investigation into the crash led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.\nWhen stock markets closed in New York on Thursday, Boeing shares were down nearly 5%.\nThe tragedy is another problem for a firm that lost nearly a billion dollars a month last year, as it grappled with a safety crisis, quality control issues, as well as a damaging workers' strike which lasted seven weeks. \nAfter one of its doors flew off midway through an Alaska Airlines flight in 2024, Boeing was forced to pay $160m (\u00a3126m) in compensation. \nBefore that, the company also reached a $428m settlement with Southwest Airlines for the financial damages caused by the long-term grounding of its 737 Max fleet.\nIn addition to severe financial issues, Boeing has faced serious questions over its safety practices. In April, the company said it had seen \"improved operational performance\" from \"our ongoing focus on safety and quality\".\nIn 2019, a former employee told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. \nJohn Barnett, who worked as a quality control manager during his more than 30 years at Boeing, took his own life in March last year. Boeing denied his assertions.\nAnother whistleblower, engineer Sam Salehpour, told US politicians that he was harassed and threatened after he raised concerns about the safety of Boeing's planes. \nBoeing said retaliation was \"strictly prohibited\" and it had seen a \"more than 500% increase\" in reports from employees since January, \"which signals progress toward a robust reporting culture that is not fearful of retaliation\".\nBoeing has also been embroiled in a series of legal battles related to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last month, the firm narrowly avoiding criminal prosecution by coming to an agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).\nTo the dismay of victims' families, the DoJ said Boeing would admit to \"conspiracy to obstruct and impede\" an investigation by the US Federal Aviation Administration and would pay more than $1.1bn in fines.\nUnsurprisingly, Boeing's top executive team has undergone a pretty significant shake-up over the past couple of years. \nIts new boss, Kelly Ortberg, came out of retirement a year ago to try to revive the ailing company. \nHe has promised an improvement to Boeing's safety culture and recently said he was confident the aviation giant would soon return to profitability.\nToday he faces more awful news to navigate.",

        "article_text": "It was a killing that shocked India: Punjabi hip-hop star Sidhu Moose Wala shot dead through the windscreen of his car by hired gunmen.\nWithin hours, a Punjabi gangster named Goldy Brar had used Facebook to claim responsibility for ordering the hit.\nBut three years after the murder, no-one has faced trial - and Goldy Brar is still on the run, his whereabouts unknown.\nNow, BBC Eye has managed to make contact with Brar and challenged him about how and why Sidhu Moose Wala became a target.\nHis response was coldly articulate.\n\"In his arrogance, he [Moose Wala] made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,\"  Brar told the BBC World Service.\n\"We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that.\"\nOn a warm May evening in 2022, Sidhu Moose Wala was taking his black Mahindra Thar SUV for its usual spin through dusty lanes near his village in the northern Indian state of Punjab when, within minutes, two cars began tailing him.\nCCTV footage later showed them weaving through narrow turns, sticking close. Then, at a bend in the road, one of the vehicles lurched forward, cornering Moose Wala's SUV against a wall. He was trapped. Moments later, the shooting began.\nMobile footage captured the aftermath. His SUV was riddled with bullets, the windscreen shattered, the bonnet punctured.\nIn trembling voices, bystanders expressed their shock and concern.\n\"Someone get him out of the car.\"\n\"Get some water.\"\n\"Moose Wala has been shot.\"\nBut it was too late. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital - hit by 24 bullets, a post-mortem would later reveal. The 28-year-old rapper, one of modern-day Punjab's biggest cultural icons, had been gunned down in broad daylight.\nOutside the UK, watch on YouTube, or listen on BBC.com\nA cousin and a friend who had been in the car with Moose Wala at the time of the ambush were injured, but survived.\nSix gunmen were eventually identified. They carried AK-47s and pistols. In the weeks that followed the murder, about 30 people were arrested and two of the suspected armed men were killed in what the Indian police described as \"encounters\".\nYet even with arrests piling up, the motive remained murky.\nGoldy Brar, who claims to have ordered the hit, wasn't in India at the time of the killing. He is believed to have been in Canada.\nOur conversation with him unfolded over six hours, pieced together through an exchange of voice notes. It gave us a chance to find out why Moose Wala had been killed and to interrogate the motives of the man who claimed responsibility.\nSidhu Moose Wala was born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu in a Jat-Sikh family in rural Punjab, before moving in 2016 to Canada to study engineering - a journey familiar to hundreds of thousands in the Punjabi diaspora.\nBut it was there, far from his village of Moosa - the inspiration for his rap name - that he reinvented himself as one of Punjabi music's most influential artists. In just five years, Moose Wala became the unmistakable voice of Punjabi hip-hop.\nWith his signature swagger, flashy style, and lyrical grit, Moose Wala sang openly about identity and politics, guns and revenge, pushing the boundaries of what Punjabi music had been willing to say.\nHe was fascinated by rapper Tupac Shakur, who had been murdered, aged 25, in 1996. \"In terms of personality, I want to be like him,\" Moose Wala once told an interviewer. \"The day he died, people cried for him. I want the same. When I die, people should remember that I was someone.\"\nOver a brief but explosive career, the singer spotlighted the darker undercurrents of India's Punjab region - gangster culture, unemployment, and political decay - while evoking a deep nostalgia for village life.\nMoose Wala was also a global force. With more than five billion views of his music videos on YouTube, a Top 5 spot in the UK charts, and collaborations with international hip-hop artists including Burna Boy, Moose Wala swiftly built a fan base stretching across India, Canada, the UK and beyond, powered by a diaspora that saw him as both icon and insurgent.\nBut fame came at a cost. Despite his rising star and socially conscious lyrics, Moose Wala was drifting into dangerous territory. His defiant attitude, visibility, and growing influence had drawn the attention of Punjab's most feared gangsters. These included Goldy Brar, and Brar's friend Lawrence Bishnoi, who even then was in a high-security jail in India.\nNot much is known about Brar, apart from the fact he is on the Interpol Red Notice list, and is a key operative in a network of gangsters operated by Bishnoi \u2013 orchestrating hits, issuing threats and amplifying the gang's reach. It is thought he emigrated to Canada in 2017, just a year after Moose Wala himself, and initially worked as a truck driver.\nBishnoi, once a student leader steeped in Punjab's violent campus politics, has grown into one of India's most feared criminal masterminds.\n\"The first [police] cases filed against Lawrence Bishnoi were all related to student politics and student elections\u2026 beating a rival student leader, kidnapping him, harming him,\" according to Jupinderjit Singh, deputy editor of Indian newspaper the Tribune.\nThis led to a spell in jail which hardened him further, says Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, Assistant Inspector General of the Anti-Gangster Task Force of Punjab Police.\n\"Once he was in jail, he started to get deeper into crime. Then he formed a group of his own. When it became an inter-gang thing, he needed money for survival. They need more manpower, they need more weapons. They need money for all that. So, for money, you have to get into extortion or crime.\"\nNow 31, Bishnoi runs his syndicate from behind bars - with dedicated Instagram pages and a cult-like following.\n\"So while Bishnoi sits in jail, Brar handles the gangs,\" says Assistant Inspector General Chauhan.\nSecuring BBC Eye's exchange with Brar took a year of chasing - cultivating sources, waiting for replies, gradually getting closer to the kingpin himself. But when we got through to Brar, the conversation cast new light on the question of how and why he and Bishnoi came to see Moose Wala as an enemy.\nOne of the first revelations was that Bishnoi's relationship with Moose Wala went back several years, long before the singer's killing.\n\"Lawrence [Bishnoi] was in touch with Sidhu [Moose Wala]. I don't know who introduced them, and I never asked. But they did speak,\" said Brar.\n\"Sidhu used to send 'good morning' and 'good night' messages in an effort to flatter Lawrence.\"\nA friend of Moose Wala's, who spoke anonymously, also told us that Bishnoi had been in touch with Moose Wala as early as 2018, calling him from jail and telling him he liked his music.\nBrar told us that the \"first dispute\" between them came after Moose Wala had moved back to India. It began with a seemingly innocuous match of kabbadi - a traditional South Asian contact team sport - in a Punjabi village.\nMoose Wala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang - Brar told us, in a sport where match-fixing and gangster influence are rampant.\n\"That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\nYet the dispute between Moose Wala and Bishnoi was eventually resolved by an associate of Bishnoi's called Vicky Middhukhera.\nBut when Middukhera himself was gunned down by gangsters in a parking lot in Mohali in August 2021, Brar told us Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moose Wala reached the point of no return.\nThe Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moose Wala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moose Wala denied any involvement.\nThe Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moose Wala to the killing or to any gang-related crime. But Moose Wala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang - a perception that may have cost him his life.\nAlthough he can cite no proof of Moose Wala's involvement, Brar remains convinced that the singer was somehow complicit in the killing of Middukhera. Brar repeatedly told us that Shaganpreet Singh had assisted the gunmen in the days before Middukhera's shooting - and inferred that Moose Wala himself must have been involved.\n\"Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\n\"We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea.\n\"So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard.\"\nWe put it to Brar that India has a judicial system and the rule of law - how could he justify taking the law into his own hands?\n\"Law. Justice. There's no such thing,\" he says. \"Only the powerful can... [obtain] justice, not ordinary people like us.\"\nHe went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system.\n\"He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going.\"\nHe appeared unrepentant.\n\"I did what I had to do for my brother. \u202fI have no remorse whatsoever.\"\nThe killing of Moose Wala has not just resulted in the loss of a major musical talent, it has also emboldened Punjab's gangsters.\nBefore the singer's murder, few outside Punjab had heard of Bishnoi or Brar.\nAfter the killing, their names were everywhere. They hijacked Moose Wala's fame and converted it into their own brand of notoriety - a notoriety that became a powerful tool for extortion.\n\"This is the biggest killing that has happened in the last few decades in Punjab,\" says Ritesh Lakhi, a Punjab-based journalist. \"The capacity of gangsters to extort money has gone up. [Goldy Brar]'s getting huge sums of money after killing Moose Wala.\"\nJournalist Jupinderjit Singh agrees: \"The fear factor around gangsters has risen amongst the public.\" \nExtortion has long been a problem in the Punjabi music industry, but now after Sidhu's murder, Singh says: \"It's not just people in the music and film industry who are being extorted - even local businessmen are receiving calls.\"\nWhen BBC Eye quizzed Brar on this, he denied this was the motive, but did admit - in stark terms - that extortion was central to the gang's working.\n\"To feed a family of four a man has to struggle all his life. We have to look after hundreds or even thousands of people who are like family to us. We have to extort people.\n\"To get money,\" he says, \"we have to be feared.\"",

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

He spent nearly eight days there.\nThe Ax-4 team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. They will also be taking their countries back to space after four decades.\nA collaboration between Nasa, Isro and the European Space Agency (Esa), Wednesday's flight by Houston-based private company Axiom Space will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket. \nGroup Captain Shukla's inclusion in the mission has generated a huge amount of interest in India and posters of the astronaut have come up in his home city Lucknow. \nDuring their two-week mission, Axiom Space says, the crew would spend most of their time conducting 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nAs he heads into space, Group Captain Shukla says, \"I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.\"\nHowever, some of the other items in his bag will be more tangible.\nThe Indian astronaut has said he would be carrying into space some of his favourite sweets especially-prepared for the mission.\n\"There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halva and moong dal [lentil] halva with me,\" he said at a press conference earlier this month, promising to share the goodies with his fellow astronauts.\nThe calorie-laden sweets, however, will pose no threat to his fitness, according to his sister Shuchi Shukla.\n\"He is a fitness-freak and highly into yoga so I am sure he will balance it,\" she told The Hindustan Times newspaper.\nAt the online press conference, the astronauts, who have been in quarantine to prepare for the trip, showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be \"the fifth crew member\" on Ax-4.\nAccording to Axiom, Joy will be \"more than a cute companion for the Ax-4 crew\" and will travel to space as their \"zero-G [zero-gravity] indicator\".\n\"It will be used as an indicator by the crew, shortly after launch, as a physical confirmation that they have transitioned to microgravity.\"\nUnveiling the five-inch-tall toy, Commander Whitson said the swan, known for its grace and elegance, was chosen for its cultural significance in the countries represented by the crew.\n\"In India, it symbolises wisdom and purity, representing the pursuit of truth. In Poland, the swan stands for purity, loyalty and resilience, while in Hungary, it epitomises loyalty, grace and the beauty of nature.\"\nGroup Captain Shukla added that in Indian culture, a swan is also the vehicle of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning and wisdom.\n\"To carry the swan to space is to carry the pursuit of knowledge, clarity of purpose and grace under pressure,\" he said.\nAxiom Space says Joy was chosen after the crew considered a number of animals, including dinosaurs and lions. The swan's name was proposed by the Hungarian astronaut Kapu. \"A team that has joy is a team that is healthy,\" he said at the press conference.\nGroup Captain Shukla has described astronaut Rakesh Sharma, India's first man in space, as his hero.\nSharma flew to space aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984 and spent nearly eight days orbiting Earth.\nGroup Captain Shukla, who was born a year later in 1985, says: \"I grew up reading about him in textbooks and listening to his stories. I was deeply, deeply impressed by him.\"\nHe's described Mr Sharma as a \"kind of a mentor for me, who is advising me on a lot of things, including how to prepare for this mission\".\nAt the press conference, he revealed that he was carrying something up to the ISS for his mentor and that he would present it to him once he returns.\nHe refused to divulge what the souvenir would be and said \"it will be a surprise\".\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Long before India gained independence, one defiant voice inside the British Empire dared to call out a colonial massacre - and paid a price for it.\nSir Chettur Sankaran Nair, a lawyer, was one of the few Indians to be appointed to top government posts when the British ruled the country.   \nIn 1919, he resigned from the Viceroy's Council after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the northern Indian city of Amritsar in Punjab, in which hundreds of civilians attending a public meeting were shot dead by British troops. On the 100th anniversary of the massacre, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May described the tragedy as a \"shameful scar\" on Britain's history in India.\nNair's criticism of Punjab's then Lieutenant Governor, Michael O'Dwyer, led to a libel case against him, which helped spotlight the massacre and the actions of British officials.\nIn a biography of Nair, KPS Menon, independent India's first foreign secretary, described him as \"a very controversial figure of his time\". \nNair was known for his independent views and distaste for extremist politics, and spoke critically of colonial rule and even of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian independence hero who is now regarded as the father of the nation. \nMenon, who married Nair's daughter Saraswathy, wrote: \"Only [Nair] could have insulted the all powerful British Viceroy on his face and opposed Mahatma Gandhi openly.\"\nNair was not a familiar name in India in recent decades, but earlier this year, a Bollywood film based on the court case, Kesari Chapter 2- starring superstar Akshay Kumar - helped bring attention to his life.\nNair was born in 1857 into a wealthy family in what is now Palakkad district in Kerala state. He studied at the Presidency College in Madras, acquiring a bachelor's degree before studying law and beginning his career as an apprentice with a Madras High Court judge.\nIn 1887, he joined the social reform movement in the Madras presidency. Throughout his career, he fought to reform Hindu laws of the time on marriage and women's rights and to abolish the caste system.\nFor some years, he was a delegate to the Indian National Congress and presided over its 1897 session in Amraoti (Amravati). In his address, he held the British-run government \"morally responsible for the extreme poverty of the masses\", saying the annual famines \"claimed more victims and created more distress than under any civilised government anywhere else in the world\". \nHe was appointed public prosecutor in 1899 and writes in his autobiography about advising the government on seditious articles in newspapers, including those by his close friend G Subramania Iyer, the first editor of The Hindu newspaper. \"On many occasions\u2026 I was able to persuade them not to take any step against him.\"\nHe became a high court judge in 1908 and was knighted four years later.\nNair moved to Delhi in 1915 when he was appointed a member of the Viceroy's Council, only the third Indian to hold the position. \nHe was a fierce proponent of India's right to govern itself and pushed for constitutional reforms during his time on the council. Through 1918 and 1919, his dissent and negotiations with Edwin Montagu, then secretary of state for India, helped expand provisions of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms which laid out how India would gradually achieve self-governance.\nMontagu wrote in his diary that he had been warned \"that it was absolutely necessary to get him on my side, for Sankaran Nair wielded more influence than any other Indian\".\nA pivotal moment in Nair's career as a statesman was the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh, when hundreds of unarmed Indians were shot dead in a public garden on the day of the Baisakhi festival. Official estimates said nearly 400 people were killed and more than 1,500 wounded by the soldiers, who fired under the orders of Brigadier General REH Dyer. Indian sources put the death toll closer to 1,000.\nNair writes in his 1922 book Gandhi and Anarchy about following the events in Punjab with increasing concern. The shooting at Jallianwala Bagh was part of a larger crackdown in the province, where martial law had been introduced - the region was cut off from the rest of the country and no newspapers were allowed into it.\n\"If to govern the country, it is necessary that innocent persons should be slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh and that any Civilian Officer may, at any time, call in the military and the two together may butcher the people as at Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in,\" he wrote.\nA month later, he resigned from the council and left for Britain, where he hoped to rouse public opinion on the massacre.\nIn his memoir, Nair writes of speaking to the editor of The Westminster Gazette which soon published an article called the Amritsar Massacre. Other papers including The Times also followed suit.\n\"Worse things had happened under British rule, but I am glad I was able to obtain publicity for this one at least,\" Nair wrote.\nNair's book Gandhi and Anarchy drew the ire of several Indian nationalists of the time after he criticised Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, calling it a \"weapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our purpose\".\nBut it was the few passages condemning Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, that became the basis for the libel suit against him in 1924. \nNair accused O'Dwyer of terrorism, holding him responsible for the atrocities committed by the civil government before the imposition of martial law. \nA five-week trial in the Court of King's Bench in London ruled 11:1 in favour of O'Dwyer, awarding damages of \u00a3500 and \u00a37,000 in costs to him.\nO'Dwyer offered to forgo this for an apology but Nair refused and paid instead.\nReports of the depositions in the hearing were published daily in The Times. Nair's family says despite losing, the case achieved his purpose of having the atrocities brought to public attention. \nNair's great-grandson Raghu Palat, who co-wrote the book The Case That Shook the Empire, with his wife Pushpa, says the case helped spark \"an uproar for the freedom movement\".\nIt also showed that \"there was no point in having a dominion status under the empire when the British cannot be expected to deal with their subjects fairly\", adds Pushpa.\nEven Gandhi referred to the case several times, writing once that Nair had showed pluck in fighting without hope of victory, historian PC Roy Chaudhury later pointed out.\nAfter losing the case, Nair continued with his career in India. He was chairman of the Indian Committee of the Simon Commission, which reviewed the working of constitutional reforms in India in 1928.\nHe died in 1934 at the age of 77.\nThrough his career, Menon notes, Nair \"bent all his thoughts and energies on the emancipation of his country from the bondage of foreign domination and native custom. In this task, he achieved as much success as any man, wedded to constitutional methods\".",

        "article_text": "A young and untested Indian Test side, led by debutant captain Shubman Gill, begins its toughest examination yet this week: a five-match series in England, starting at Headingley. \nIt marks the start of the fourth World Test Championship (WTC) cycle and the first contest for the newly renamed Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, promising both rich drama and formidable challenges.\nEngland have never made a WTC final. India reached the first two but lost - to New Zealand in 2021 and Australia in 2023. A winning start would lift either side's new campaign.\nIndia thrashed England 4-1 in their last meeting, but that was on spin-friendly pitches at home. In England, seaming conditions will test adaptability, technique and mental grit - especially for the batters.\nEngland's Bazball era - led by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum - divides opinion, but the results are harder to argue with: since 2022, they haven't lost a home series and have won a majority of their Tests.\nIn contrast, past records - compounded by recent form, retirements, injuries and fitness concerns - make this a daunting challenge for India.\nSince their Test debut at Lord's in 1932, they've toured England 18 times but won only three series - 1971, 1986 and 2007 - while suffering four whitewashes. \nThe historical imbalance is amplified by recent form: India have lost six of their last eight Tests, missing out on the WTC final and losing stalwarts R Ashwin, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to sudden retirements. \nAshwin exited mid-series in Australia last November. Sharma and Kohli announced their retirements just before the England tour squad was picked. To make matters worse, pace spearhead Mohammed Shami was ruled out, with BCCI doctors yet to clear him for red-ball cricket after surgery and rehab.\nThis leaves India without four high-impact players who shaped a golden era in Test cricket, even if it didn't bring WTC silverware. Sharma's departure also forced a leadership transition.\nEnter Shubman Gill. His appointment - over vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah - came after intense internal debate. Bumrah reportedly wasn't confident he could play all five Tests in a packed English summer.\nBumrah's fitness is now the biggest concern. At full tilt, he's arguably the world's best fast bowler, a player who can tilt matches single-handedly.

It is expected to splash down in just under 24 hours. \nLed by former Nasa veteran Peggy Whitson and piloted by Group Captain Shukla, Ax-4 had arrived at ISS on 26 June. Its crew included Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to have gone to space. His trip came 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma flew aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - is a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. \nOn Monday, ISS posted on X that the Ax-4 crew had taken their places in the spacecraft and its hatches had been closed. The undocking of the craft - when it separated from the ISS - was broadcast live. \nAxiom Space said the craft would splash down in the ocean off the coast of California and a vessel would then pick it up.\nIndian Science Minister Jitendra Singh has said the splash down is scheduled for 15 July at approximately 15:00 India time (09:30 GMT).\nIn his farewell address from aboard the ISS on Sunday, the Indian astronaut said India's journey in space exploration may be tough, but it has begun.\n\"It has been an incredible journey. Even though now it is coming to an end, for you and me there is a long way to go. The journey of our human space mission is very long and difficult. But if we are determined, even the stars are attainable.\"\nHe referred to India's first man in space cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma famously quoting from a 1924 Urdu song \"Sare jahan se achcha\" to say \"India looked better than the rest of the world\".\n\"Even today we want to know how it looks from space. I'll tell you. From space, today's India looks ambitious. It looks fearless. It looks confident. It looks proud. And so, I can once again say that today's India still looks better than the rest of the world,\" Group Captain Shukla said. \nAx-4, which was originally expected to spend two weeks on the ISS, ended up staying a few days longer. During their stay, Axiom Space said the crew conducted 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nIsro, which had paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla on Ax-4 and his training, has said the hands-on experience he gains during his trip to the ISS will help India in its human space flights.\nIsro has announced plans to launch Gaganyaan - the country's first-ever human space flight in 2027 - and has ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nGroup Captain Shukla is among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on Gaganyaan.\nBorn on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.\nHe has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks and has more than 2,000 hours of flying experience.\nBefore flying into space, Group Captain Shukla described the past year as \"nothing short of transformative\".\n\"It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.

        "article_text": "During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. \nBehind this authoritarian curtain, her Congress party government quietly began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book.\nIn Indira Gandhi and the Years That Transformed India, Prof Raghavan shows how Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system - one that would centralise executive power, sideline an \"obstructionist\" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus.\nInspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. \nIt all began, writes Prof Raghavan, in September 1975, when BK Nehru, a seasoned diplomat and a close aide of Gandhi, wrote a letter hailing the Emergency as a \"tour de force of immense courage and power produced by popular support\" and urged Gandhi to seize the moment. \nParliamentary democracy had \"not been able to provide the answer to our needs\", Nehru wrote. In this system the executive was continuously dependent on the support of an elected legislature \"which is looking for popularity and stops any unpleasant measure\".\nWhat India needed, Nehru said, was a directly elected president - freed from parliamentary dependence and capable of taking \"tough, unpleasant and unpopular decisions\" in the national interest, Prof Raghavan writes.\nThe model he pointed to was de Gaulle's France - concentrating power in a strong presidency. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. He even proposed stripping fundamental rights - right to equality or freedom of speech, for example - of their justiciability.\nNehru urged Indira Gandhi to \"make these fundamental changes in the Constitution now when you have two-thirds majority\". His ideas were \"received with rapture\" by the prime minister's secretary PN Dhar. Gandhi then gave Nehru approval to discuss these ideas with her party leaders but said \"very clearly and emphatically\" that he  should not convey the impression that they had the stamp of her approval. \nProf Raghavan writes that the ideas met with enthusiastic support from senior Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram and foreign minister Swaran Singh. The chief minister of Haryana state  was blunt: \"Get rid of this election nonsense. If you ask me just make our sister [Indira Gandhi] President for life and there's no need to do anything else\". M Karunanidhi of Tamil Nadu \u2013 one of two non-Congress chief ministers consulted - was unimpressed.\nWhen Nehru reported back to Gandhi, she remained non-committal, Prof Raghavan writes. She instructed her closest aides to explore the proposals further. \nWhat emerged was a document titled \"A Fresh Look at Our Constitution: Some suggestions\", drafted in secrecy and circulated among trusted advisors. It proposed a president with powers greater than even their American counterpart, including control over judicial appointments and legislation. A new \"Superior Council of Judiciary\", chaired by the president, would interpret \"laws and the Constitution\" - effectively neutering the Supreme Court.\nGandhi sent this document to Dhar, who recognised it \"twisted the Constitution in an ambiguously authoritarian direction\". Congress president DK Barooah tested the waters by publicly calling for a \"thorough re-examination\" of the Constitution at the party's 1975 annual session.\nThe idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal. But its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.\nThe amendment made striking down laws harder by requiring supermajorities of five or seven judges, and aimed to dilute the Constitution's 'basic structure doctrine' that limited parliament's power.\nIt also handed the federal government sweeping authority to deploy armed forces in states, declare region-specific Emergencies, and extend President's Rule - direct federal rule - from six months to a year. It also put election disputes out of the judiciary's reach.\nThis was not yet a presidential system, but it carried its genetic imprint - a powerful executive, marginalised judiciary and weakened checks and balances.  The Statesman newspaper warned that \"by one sure stroke, the amendment tilts the constitutional balance in favour of the parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, Gandhi's loyalists were going all in. Defence minister Bansi Lal urged \"lifelong power\" for her as prime minister, while Congress members in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh unanimously called for a new constituent assembly in October 1976.\n\"The prime minister was taken aback. She decided to snub these moves and hasten the passage of the amendment bill in the parliament,\" writes Prof Raghavan.\nBy December 1976, the bill had been passed by both houses of parliament and ratified by 13 state legislatures and signed into law by the president.\nAfter Gandhi's shock defeat in 1977, the short-lived Janata Party - a patchwork of anti-Gandhi forces - moved quickly to undo the damage. Through the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Amendments, it rolled back key parts of the Forty Second, scrapping authoritarian provisions and restoring democratic checks and balances.\nGandhi was swept back to power in January 1980, after the Janata Party government collapsed due to internal divisions and leadership struggles. Curiously, two years later, prominent voices in the party again mooted the idea of a presidential system.\nIn 1982, with President Sanjiva Reddy's term ending, Gandhi seriously considered stepping down as prime minister to become president of India. \nHer principal secretary later revealed she was \"very serious\" about the move. She was tired of carrying the Congress party on her back and saw the presidency as a way to deliver a \"shock treatment to her party, thereby giving it a new stimulus\".\nUltimately, she backed down. Instead, she elevated Zail Singh, her loyal home minister, to the presidency.\nDespite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system. Did Gandhi, a deeply tactical politician, hold herself back ? Or was there no national appetite for radical change and India's parliamentary system proved sticky?\nThere was a hint of presidential drift in the early 1970s, as India's parliamentary democracy - especially after 1967 - grew more competitive and unstable, marked by fragile coalitions, according to Prof Raghavan. Around this time, voices began suggesting that a presidential system might suit India better. The Emergency became the moment when these ideas crystallised into serious political thinking.\n\"The aim was to reshape the system in ways that immediately strengthened her hold on power. There was no grand long-term design - most of the lasting consequences of her [Gandhi's] rule were likely unintended,\" Prof Raghavan told the BBC.\n\"During the Emergency, her primary goal was short-term: to shield her office from any challenge. The Forty Second Amendment was crafted to ensure that even the judiciary couldn't stand in her way.\"\nThe itch for a presidential system within the Congress never quite faded. As late as April 1984, senior minister Vasant Sathe launched a nationwide debate advocating a shift to presidential governance - even while in power. \nBut six months later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in Delhi, and with her, the conversation abruptly died. India stayed a parliamentary democracy.  ",

        "article_text": "Parents in several Indian cities, including capital Delhi, are protesting against what they call \"unsustainable\" fee raises by private schools. These increases, they say, are stretching household budgets to a breaking point and taking a toll on their children.\nAaditya Mattey, 14, woke up on 9 May feeling confident about his English exam.\nHis father dropped him off at his school in Indian capital Delhi, but Aaditya never got to write his exam.\n\"Two or three minutes after I entered the class, guards and bouncers asked me to leave the room,\" Aaditya recalls.\nHis father was still standing outside the school gates when Aaditya and a few other students were asked to get on the school bus, which dropped them off at their homes.\nAaditya's name was removed from Delhi Public School Dwarka's rolls after his father refused to pay a recent fee hike which he alleges was arbitrary and unauthorised.\nThe BBC reached out to DPS Dwarka and the Delhi Public School Society - which runs the DPS chain of schools - for comment, but did not receive a response.\nAaditya's case is not an isolated one and DPS is not the only school which is facing allegations of arbitrary fee increase.\nOver the past two months, protests have erupted across Indian cities - from Delhi to Pune to Hyderabad -  as a growing number of parents accuse private schools of imposing steep fee raises. \nIn Delhi, which has emerged as the epicentre of the protests, the issue recently made headlines after DPS Dwarka allegedly confined students in the library, hired security guards to stop them from entering classes and expelled them over unpaid dues. Parents have accused the school of punishing children for financial decisions made by their families.\nGovernment-run schools operate nationwide but often suffer from poor, inconsistent quality, prompting even many low-income families to choose private schools for better opportunities.\nIn Delhi, rules say that private schools on government-leased land must get Directorate of Education (DoE) approval before raising fees and must admit 25% economically weaker or disadvantaged students - a condition tied to their subsidised leases.\nThe BBC has contacted the DoE for comment on the fee rises, which parents have reported to us, but has not received a response.\nSchools, on the other hand, have argued in court and told parents that they are struggling. They cite inflation, rising staff salaries, delayed reimbursements from the government for economically weaker students and the need for infrastructure upgrades as reasons for raising fees.\nDivya Mattey says his son Aaditya's annual fee in 2020 was 93,400 rupees ($1,077; \u00a3802). This, he says, has more than doubled to 189,096 rupees in 2025-26.\nMr Mattey is among dozens of parents who have taken the school to court, alleging it has unlawfully removed students from rolls and harassed families over the fee issue.\n\"We never thought a school of this stature would treat children like this - bar them from classrooms, assign bouncers and make them sit in the library for days,\" he says.\nThe school did not answer the BBC's questions over email and on a phone call. But in court, it reportedly argued that there was no legal obligation to retain students whose fees haven't been paid. According to a report in The Indian Express newspaper, DPS claimed it suffered losses of 490m rupees last year and had to raise fees.\nA notice on the school's website meanwhile accuses \"a small group of parents\" of spreading \"false and malicious information regarding the school fee structure\" in an attempt to \"mislead and create confusion\".\nBut the controversy reflects a broader problem.\nA recent survey by online community platform LocalCircles found that more than 80% of parents with children in private schools said fees had increased by over 10% this academic year. In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, the rise in some schools was as high as 30%.\nIndia has no centralised regulation for private schools; each state sets its own rules.\nFor example, Maharashtra allows a 15% fee rise every two years - subject to review if 25% of parents object - while Karnataka permits a 10% annual increase with audit justification. Enforcement, however, is weak, and legal disputes over fees often drag on for years, providing little timely relief to families.\nGagandeep Singh, whose son attends Mira Model School in West Delhi, says fees rose 45% last year and over 10% this year.\nSingh is willing to pay the earlier DoE-approved fee, but says the school has refused his cheque for the current term, which began nearly three months ago.\nThe BBC reached out to Mira Model School but received no response.\n\"It's not our job to regulate schools,\" Mr Singh says. \"That's what the government is supposed to do.\"\nMeanwhile, many parents fear that the DPS case has set a troubling precedent.\n\"We don't want our children to be thrown out of their classes, like what happened there,\" says Pankaj Gupta, whose son studies at Delhi's Maharaja Agarsain Public School.\nMr Gupta said the school increased fees by 25% this year without advance notice.\n\"We had no choice. We had to pay,\" he added.\nMr Gupta runs a small convenience store but has faced declining sales since the pandemic. The rise of online shopping has further squeezed physical stores. Now, rising school fees are pushing his family to the brink.\nThe BBC has reached out to Maharaja Agarsain Public School for comment.\nAnother parent, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she's considering withdrawing her son from the school he attended since childhood due to an \"unsustainable\" 30% fee hike this year.\n\"Both my husband and I work, but our salaries haven't gone up significantly. As a parent, you try to give your child the best but sometimes that comes at great personal cost,\" she said.\nBut she admits that switching schools also feels risky - what if the next one also increases fees?\n\"It's the same situation everywhere,\" she said.\nThe uproar has prompted the Delhi government to act.\nOn 10 June the state cabinet approved the Delhi School Education (Transparency in Fixation and Regulation of Fees) Ordinance, 2025, pending the Lieutenant Governor's approval - necessary for it to become a law.\nThough not yet public, Education Minister Ashish Sood says it will tighten private school fee regulations.\nBut parents are demanding greater transparency. Last weekend, hundreds protested in Delhi, urging the government to consider their feedback when drafting the bill.\nShikha Sharma Bagga, Supreme Court lawyer and secretary of a group called Justice for All, urges timely audits: \"Schools' finances must be audited before each academic year so parents know what they're paying for.\"\nBack in Dwarka, Aaditya is still trying to get back to class.\nMedia reports say DPS Dwarka has agreed to reinstate students expelled for not paying fees. But Mr Mattey says they are still waiting.\n\"The school has shown some reciprocation, but to this date my child's name is not back on the register,\" he says, adding that he hasn't received any assignments for the current academic session.\n\"My son is only 14. He should be focusing on his studies, not worrying about whether he'll be allowed to sit in class tomorrow.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Just how safe are India's skies? \nIt's a question many are asking after June's devastating Air India crash, which killed at least 260 people. The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner went down less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in western India on 12 June.\n\"India's skies have always been safe - in the past and even today,\" said Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, the chief of Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - India's aviation safety regulator - in an interview with the BBC.\n\"If you look at global safety metrics, such as those published by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which track the number of accidents per million flights, India consistently performs better than the world average,\" he said. \n\"There were only two years within the 2010\u20132024 period where we exceeded the global average - those were the years when major accidents occurred.\"\nIn August 2020, Air India Express Flight 1344 crashed after skidding off a rain-soaked tabletop runway in Kozhikode, killing 21 people. A decade earlier, in May 2010, Flight 812 from Dubai overshot the runway in Mangalore and plunged into a gorge, leaving 158 dead. June's Air India crash was the third such accident in the country in 15 years.\nWhile such major accidents remain rare, recent headlines have raised fresh concerns. From a Delhi-Srinagar flight that hit severe turbulence, to growing reports of maintenance oversights and training shortfalls, questions around aviation safety are once again in focus.\nThe latest involved SpiceJet, India's fourth-largest and longest-running low-cost airline.\nThe Economic Times newspaper found that the aviation regulator had recently summoned the airline's leadership after a series of alarming findings - not from routine audits, but triggered by a British aviation firm.\nThe newspaper reported that it began earlier this year when two of SpiceJet's De Havilland Q400 turboprops showed premature propeller failures. The airline alerted Dowty Propellers, a GE Aerospace-led UK manufacturer, which found damage to the internal bearings of the propellers.\nEach propeller has bearings with two races, or rings or tracks. In this case, the inner race was damaged. Instead of addressing the root cause, SpiceJet \"reportedly kept applying more grease to the [entire] unit instead of addressing the root cause\". Frustrated by the lack of corrective action, Dowty escalated the issue directly to India's aviation regulator, the newspaper reported.\nThe DGCA's own audit in April \"revealed even more deficiencies, including snag occurrences\", the report said.\nMr Kidwai told the BBC that the \"turboprop propeller issue came to our attention through one of SpiceJet's maintenance organisations\". \n\"We took it up with SpiceJet and we ensured they took corrective action. We also found out that the senior management was not fully aware of the situation. We took action against the various post holders who were supposed to ensure compliance with the original equipment manufacturer and other regulations. We directed SpiceJet to remove them and suspend a few of them which they did,\" he said.\nMore recently, Reuters reported that the aviation watchdog reprimanded Air India's budget carrier in March for delaying mandatory engine part replacements on an Airbus A320 and falsifying records to show compliance. \nAir India Express told the news agency it acknowledged the error to DGCA and undertook \"remedial action and preventive measures\". \nMr Kidwai told the BBC that the information in this case came through \"self-reporting by the airline\".\n\"I would not condone it [the lapses]. But [at least] we have started getting these reports. This came from the airline. Action has been taken in this case. In our audits we have mandated our people to be more alert and see whether there is any lapse and bring it to our attention.\"\nIn May, an IndiGo flight from Delhi to Srinagar faced severe turbulence and hail about 45 minutes after takeoff.\nThe Airbus A321, carrying 222 passengers, reportedly encountered extreme vertical air currents - updrafts followed by downdrafts - that dislodged overhead bins and caused nose damage. The crew declared an emergency and safely landed at Srinagar with no injuries. The regulator launched an investigation, during which two pilots were grounded.\nMr Kidwai told the BBC that the regulator had now \"refined\" its guidelines for pilots flying in turbulent conditions.\nFor instance, if there's significant cloud cover or any weather pattern that poses a risk - and \"we've clearly defined what constitutes such a risk\" - pilots are now required to take specific action a set number of nautical miles before reaching it, he said. \n\"This could include diverting, going around, or taking other appropriate steps.\"\nSince 2020, Indian domestic carriers have reported 2,461 technical faults, according to the federal civil aviation ministry data. IndiGo accounted for over half (1,288), followed by SpiceJet with 633, and Air India and its subsidiary Air India Express with 389 cases, as of January 2025.\n\"Reporting of snags by airlines has gone up. This is good,\" Mr Kidwai said.\n\"I wouldn't say I'm pleased about it. But I do see value in the growing culture of reporting [snags]. It's far better for every snag to be brought to the attention of the authorities than keeping quiet and operating the aircraft.\" \nMr Kidwai said with the number of flights increasing, it's important to \"see whether the turnaround time for flights is adequate for [maintenance] checks or not\".\nTo be sure, demands on the regulator have grown: India has emerged as the third-largest passenger aviation market in the world. Yet, over the past two years, the ministry of civil aviation has faced budget cuts, reflecting a reduced financial priority for the sector.\nToday, the country's scheduled carriers operate nearly 850 aircraft - a significant increase from around 400 just a decade ago.\nThe number of air passengers has more than doubled since 2014\u201315 - from 116 million to 239 million.\nThe number of commercial aerodromes has also seen a substantial rise - from around 60-70 a decade ago to nearly 130-140 today.\n\"In total, including both scheduled and non-scheduled operators, we now have 1,288 aircraft in operation. By the end of the decade, we are projected to operate over 2,000 aircraft,\" Mr Kidwai said. (Non-scheduled operators include charter airlines, private jet operators, air taxis and helicopter services.)\nSo had the latest Air India crash dented the reputation of air travel in India? Mr Kidwai said the data didn't point to that.\n\"We looked at the data to assess whether it had any impact on domestic or international operations. There was no significant drop in traffic. At most, we observed a very marginal dip for a short period, affecting both domestic and international flights, along with a few cancellations,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It's natural for people to feel anxious after such incidents. But over time, as more clarity emerges and the situation is better understood, that anxiety tends to subside. Time is a great healer.\"",

It said seconds after take-off, both of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel.\nThe report released on Saturday gave details of the cockpit voice recording with one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the other replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. Data shows the switches were then moved to \"run\" position, but the plane crashed within seconds. \nAviation experts and pilots say the fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation and they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps.\nThe report, however, mentions that in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nWhile the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.\nThe FAA has now said it has seen the report and that fuel control switches in Boeing aeroplanes are safe.\nThe aviation regulator said its own 2018 advisory \"was based on reports that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged\" - but added that it did not believe this made the planes unsafe. \nThe preliminary report does not throw any light on how the switches were moved to cut-off, but since its release, sections of media and social media has been awash with speculation about the role of pilots.\n\"We are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse - particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide,\" the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA) said in a statement released late on Saturday night.\n\"Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible - it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved.\" \nThe statement added that until the official investigation was concluded and the final report was published, \"any speculation - especially of such a grave nature - is unacceptable and must be condemned\".\nThe preliminary investigation was led by Indian government with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators and participants from the US and UK. A final report is due to come out in a year.\nOn Saturday, another pilots' grouping - the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India) - had raised concerns over the way the investigation was being handled.\nThe ALPA India also said it was \"surprised at the secrecy surrounding these investigations\" and alleged that \"suitably qualified personnel were not taken on board for the probe\".\n\"We feel that the investigation is being driven in a direction presuming the guilt of pilots and we strongly object to this line of thought,\" ALPA India's president Captain Sam Thomas said in the statement.\nThe union also urged the authorities to allow it to join the process \"even in the capacity of observers so as to provide the requisite transparency in the investigations\".\nFollowing the report's release on Saturday, Indian Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu told reporters to not \"jump to any conclusions at this stage. Let us wait for the final report\".\nDescribing the pilots and crew in India as the \"backbone of this civil aviation\", he said India had \"the most wonderful workforce in terms of pilots and the crew in the whole world\".\nFlight 171 had taken off from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad for Gatwick in London on 12 June with 242 people on board.

The investigation is ongoing.\nManju Mahesh Patel, 79, was one of the 260 people killed - most of whom were passengers - when the London-bound plane fell into a densely populated neighbourhood in the western Indian city.\nHer granddaughter found reading the report \"quite heartbreaking\", as there were images from the immediate aftermath of the crash - including the wreckage - that were difficult to process. \n\"For me, I can't sort of stop thinking about what my grandma's final moments must have looked like,\" she said from her home in Buckinghamshire.\nMs Patel's grandmother had been staying in Ahmedabad for the prior few months, carrying out charity work at a temple.

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not specify whether an emergency situation had taken place on board in its preliminary report. \nThe cut-off then caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report found.\nFor Ms Patel, the preliminary report still points to several theories and its findings are incomplete.\nBut she stressed how \"extremely important\" it was for her and others to find out what the underlying cause of the crash was.\n\"I feel like I can't really be at peace with what's happened, unless I understand where the accountability lies.\"\nSameer Rafik, a cousin of crash victim Faizan Rafik, is similarly calling for more details to be brought forward. \n\"The Indian Government should release the cockpit audio for the families who lost loved ones,\" he said.

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "In Manhattan's West Village, where culinary trends can change with the seasons, Chef Vijay Kumar is shaping a quiet revolution. \nHis 2025 James Beard Award win for Best Chef: New York State this month is more than just personal recognition - it marks a cultural inflection point. \nChennai-based culinary historian Rakesh Raghunathan says: \"Following in the footsteps of fellow Tamil-origin recipients like Raghavan Iyer and Padma Lakshmi, Vijay Kumar's recognition reflects a growing momentum for south Indian voices on the global culinary stage\". \n\"Tamil cuisine -  along with Sri Lankan Tamil and other south Indian regional traditions - is increasingly being embraced by global diners as something refined, rich, and deeply rooted in culture.\"\nBorn in the small farming village of Natham in southern Tamil Nadu, the 44-year-old Kumar has always cooked from memory - of forests and foraging, firewood stoves and his mother and grandmother serving meals made from scratch for the family.\nWhen he took the stage at the JB awards ceremony, he said \"the food I grew up on, the food made with care, with fire, with soul is now taking the main stage\". It was a moment of deep emotion and cultural pride for Kumar. \n\"There is no such thing as a poor person's food, or a rich person's food. It's food. It's powerful. And the real luxury is to be able to connect with each other around the dinner table.\"\nFor Kumar, the win is a personal milestone but also a powerful act of visibility. \n\"When I started cooking, I never thought a dark-skinned boy from Tamil Nadu could make it to a room like this,\" he said in his acceptance speech. It was therefore important for him to wear veshti, the traditional Tamil attire for men, for the black-tie James Beard ceremony as a nod to his roots.\nRecently, Kumar was trolled by a pair of influencers in New York. Quick to rise to his defence was Padma Lakshmi, cookbook author and culinary ambassador, who called the influencers out for their cultural insensitivity.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Lakshmi said \"Vijay's story is important not just for south Indian food but also as a story of someone who grew up with humble means and cooked with limited resources.\" \n\"This resourcefulness has not only propelled his work ethic but enhanced his sense of flavour, ingredients and sense of the world. He is a beacon of hope to young people all over the world that if you trust and develop your senses and skills, you can go far in a creative career.\"\nKumar's journey wasn't smooth to start with. \nUnable to afford engineering school in the big city, he chose culinary school instead - beginning his journey at Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai, cooking his way through cruise ships and kitchens, and eventually finding his promised land in America, working at Dosa in San Francisco. \nHis real breakthrough came when he partnered with Roni Mazumdar and Chintan Pandya of Unapologetic Foods, a New York restaurant group, to open Semma - a Tamil slang word for \"fantastic\" in 2021.\nThe trio found a \"shared sense of wanting to honour our heritage, to tell the world who we really are through our cuisine\". \n\"At that moment, it wasn't just about food, it was about identity,\" Mazumdar told the BBC. \"For too long, Indian food in the US has lived under the veil of a manufactured, watered-down north-western lens. With Semma, we set out to pull back that curtain and share something more honest.\"\nKumar jumped at the opportunity to share his cuisine with the world. \"His eyes lit up when we started talking about the food we grew up eating, and that kind of food rarely makes it to restaurant menus,\" recalls Mazumdar.\nKumar's strength lies in serving authentic village food that is seasonal, hyper-local, and built entirely from scratch. His farm-to-table approach, he says, was to cook the way \"my mother and grandmother did\". Semma, he adds, is a celebration of that simplicity.\nThat simplicity resonates. \nSemma's menu defies the clich\u00e9s that often define Indian food abroad. There's no butter chicken or naan here and Kumar's epiphany came with an unlikely encounter: French escargot. \nAs a child, on days when rice was scarce, he would forage with his family for snails in the paddy fields, which would be cooked in a savoury tamarind sauce. Kumar admitted that he was ashamed of it as a boy as it \"felt like food born of poverty - until I saw the pride with which the French serve escargot\". \nToday, the dish, nathai pirattal, sits proudly on Semma's menu, reimagined not as a memory of scarcity, but as a symbol of resilience and cultural pride. \nSemma's menu - pepper rasam, tamarind crab, banana flower vadai, the ubiquitous dosa - offer an emotional connection for many diaspora diners, and a revelation for first-timers.\nKumar's intention to bring village-style Tamil food and showcase it in upscale spots and in the cut-throat New York restaurant space has won a long line of admirers. \nThere's depth, regionality and a powerful emotional connection in this food. \nThe cocktails are a nod to Tamil film stars like Rajnikanth and Silk Smitha, and the d\u00e9cor channels Chennai's warmth. Even the kitchen is a space of intention - cooks are asked to prepare food with \"gratitude and mindfulness\".\n\"I invited him to curate a black-tie gala dinner for 650 guests at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles, and he made us all proud. A year later, people still talk about how incredible the food was,\" says Lakshmi, applauding Kumar's gift for bringing regional Indian cuisine to the most glamorous platforms.\nThe awards and accolades feel like a natural progression of his journey. Semma is the first New York restaurant serving only south Indian cuisine to win a Michelin star and topped The New York Times's list for top 100 restaurants. And now the JBA for Kumar.\nIn many ways, Kumar is not just serving food - he is serving memory, pride and a quiet revolution. \nHis James Beard win is a recognition of his talent, but also an affirmation that regional Indian cuisine, with its bold spices and soulful simplicity, belongs at the centre of the global table.\nKumar's win has piqued the \"curiosity of young people from all over the Indian diaspora and instilled a greater pride in our food ways\", says Lakshmi. \"This will be his greatest legacy.\"\nAdds Mazumdar, \"This win is a signal that regionality matters, and that our stories and our roots have value on the world stage.\"",

        "article_text": "During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. \nBehind this authoritarian curtain, her Congress party government quietly began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book.\nIn Indira Gandhi and the Years That Transformed India, Prof Raghavan shows how Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system - one that would centralise executive power, sideline an \"obstructionist\" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus.\nInspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. \nIt all began, writes Prof Raghavan, in September 1975, when BK Nehru, a seasoned diplomat and a close aide of Gandhi, wrote a letter hailing the Emergency as a \"tour de force of immense courage and power produced by popular support\" and urged Gandhi to seize the moment. \nParliamentary democracy had \"not been able to provide the answer to our needs\", Nehru wrote. In this system the executive was continuously dependent on the support of an elected legislature \"which is looking for popularity and stops any unpleasant measure\".\nWhat India needed, Nehru said, was a directly elected president - freed from parliamentary dependence and capable of taking \"tough, unpleasant and unpopular decisions\" in the national interest, Prof Raghavan writes.\nThe model he pointed to was de Gaulle's France - concentrating power in a strong presidency. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. He even proposed stripping fundamental rights - right to equality or freedom of speech, for example - of their justiciability.\nNehru urged Indira Gandhi to \"make these fundamental changes in the Constitution now when you have two-thirds majority\". His ideas were \"received with rapture\" by the prime minister's secretary PN Dhar. Gandhi then gave Nehru approval to discuss these ideas with her party leaders but said \"very clearly and emphatically\" that he  should not convey the impression that they had the stamp of her approval. \nProf Raghavan writes that the ideas met with enthusiastic support from senior Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram and foreign minister Swaran Singh. The chief minister of Haryana state  was blunt: \"Get rid of this election nonsense. If you ask me just make our sister [Indira Gandhi] President for life and there's no need to do anything else\". M Karunanidhi of Tamil Nadu \u2013 one of two non-Congress chief ministers consulted - was unimpressed.\nWhen Nehru reported back to Gandhi, she remained non-committal, Prof Raghavan writes. She instructed her closest aides to explore the proposals further. \nWhat emerged was a document titled \"A Fresh Look at Our Constitution: Some suggestions\", drafted in secrecy and circulated among trusted advisors. It proposed a president with powers greater than even their American counterpart, including control over judicial appointments and legislation. A new \"Superior Council of Judiciary\", chaired by the president, would interpret \"laws and the Constitution\" - effectively neutering the Supreme Court.\nGandhi sent this document to Dhar, who recognised it \"twisted the Constitution in an ambiguously authoritarian direction\". Congress president DK Barooah tested the waters by publicly calling for a \"thorough re-examination\" of the Constitution at the party's 1975 annual session.\nThe idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal. But its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.\nThe amendment made striking down laws harder by requiring supermajorities of five or seven judges, and aimed to dilute the Constitution's 'basic structure doctrine' that limited parliament's power.\nIt also handed the federal government sweeping authority to deploy armed forces in states, declare region-specific Emergencies, and extend President's Rule - direct federal rule - from six months to a year. It also put election disputes out of the judiciary's reach.\nThis was not yet a presidential system, but it carried its genetic imprint - a powerful executive, marginalised judiciary and weakened checks and balances.  The Statesman newspaper warned that \"by one sure stroke, the amendment tilts the constitutional balance in favour of the parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, Gandhi's loyalists were going all in. Defence minister Bansi Lal urged \"lifelong power\" for her as prime minister, while Congress members in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh unanimously called for a new constituent assembly in October 1976.\n\"The prime minister was taken aback. She decided to snub these moves and hasten the passage of the amendment bill in the parliament,\" writes Prof Raghavan.\nBy December 1976, the bill had been passed by both houses of parliament and ratified by 13 state legislatures and signed into law by the president.\nAfter Gandhi's shock defeat in 1977, the short-lived Janata Party - a patchwork of anti-Gandhi forces - moved quickly to undo the damage. Through the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Amendments, it rolled back key parts of the Forty Second, scrapping authoritarian provisions and restoring democratic checks and balances.\nGandhi was swept back to power in January 1980, after the Janata Party government collapsed due to internal divisions and leadership struggles. Curiously, two years later, prominent voices in the party again mooted the idea of a presidential system.\nIn 1982, with President Sanjiva Reddy's term ending, Gandhi seriously considered stepping down as prime minister to become president of India. \nHer principal secretary later revealed she was \"very serious\" about the move. She was tired of carrying the Congress party on her back and saw the presidency as a way to deliver a \"shock treatment to her party, thereby giving it a new stimulus\".\nUltimately, she backed down. Instead, she elevated Zail Singh, her loyal home minister, to the presidency.\nDespite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system. Did Gandhi, a deeply tactical politician, hold herself back ? Or was there no national appetite for radical change and India's parliamentary system proved sticky?\nThere was a hint of presidential drift in the early 1970s, as India's parliamentary democracy - especially after 1967 - grew more competitive and unstable, marked by fragile coalitions, according to Prof Raghavan. Around this time, voices began suggesting that a presidential system might suit India better. The Emergency became the moment when these ideas crystallised into serious political thinking.\n\"The aim was to reshape the system in ways that immediately strengthened her hold on power. There was no grand long-term design - most of the lasting consequences of her [Gandhi's] rule were likely unintended,\" Prof Raghavan told the BBC.\n\"During the Emergency, her primary goal was short-term: to shield her office from any challenge. The Forty Second Amendment was crafted to ensure that even the judiciary couldn't stand in her way.\"\nThe itch for a presidential system within the Congress never quite faded. As late as April 1984, senior minister Vasant Sathe launched a nationwide debate advocating a shift to presidential governance - even while in power. \nBut six months later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in Delhi, and with her, the conversation abruptly died. India stayed a parliamentary democracy.  ",

        "article_text": "In the winter of 1956, The Times correspondent David Holden arrived on the island of Bahrain, then still a British protectorate. \nAfter a short-lived career teaching geography, Holden had looked forward to his Arabian posting, but he hadn't expected to be attending a garden durbar in honour of Queen Victoria's appointment as Empress of India. \nEverywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India. \n\"The Raj maintains here a slightly phantasmal sway,\" wrote Holden, \"a situation rich in anomaly and anachronism\u2026 The servants are all bearers, the laundryman a dhobi, and the watchman a chowkidar,\" he wrote, \"and on Sundays the guests are confronted with the ancient, and agreeable, Anglo-Indian ritual of a mountainous curry lunch.\" \nThe Sultan of Oman, educated in Rajasthan, was more fluent in Urdu than Arabic, while soldiers in the nearby state of Qu'aiti, now eastern Yemen, marched around in now-defunct Hyderabadi army uniforms.\nIn the words of the governor of Aden himself: \n\"One had an extraordinarily powerful impression that all the clocks here had stopped seventy years ago; that the Raj was at its height, Victoria on the throne, Gilbert and Sullivan a fresh and revolutionary phenomenon, and Kipling a dangerous debunker, so strong was the link from Delhi via Hyderabad to the South Arabian shore.\"\nAlthough largely forgotten today, in the early 20th Century, nearly a third of the Arabian Peninsula was ruled as part of the British Indian Empire. \nFrom Aden to Kuwait, a crescent of Arabian protectorates was governed from Delhi, overseen by the Indian Political Service, policed by Indian troops, and answerable to the Viceroy of India.\nUnder the Interpretation Act of 1889, these protectorates had all legally been considered part of India. \nThe standard list of India's semi-independent princely states like Jaipur opened alphabetically with Abu Dhabi, and the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, even suggested that Oman should be treated \"as much a Native State of the Indian Empire as Lus Beyla or Kelat [present day Balochistan]\". \nIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern Yemen, which functioned as India's westernmost port and was administered as part of Bombay Province. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1931, he found many young Arabs identifying as Indian nationalists.\nEven at the time, however, few members of the British or Indian public were aware of this Arabian extension of the British Raj. \nMaps showing the full reach of the Indian Empire were only published in top secrecy, and the Arabian territories were left off public documents to avoid provoking the Ottomans or later the Saudis. \nIndeed, as one Royal Asiatic Society lecturer quipped:\n\"As a jealous sheikh veils his favourite wife, so the British authorities shroud conditions in the Arab states in such thick mystery that ill-disposed propagandists might almost be excused for thinking that something dreadful is going on there.\"\nBut by the 1920s, politics was shifting. Indian nationalists began to imagine India not as an imperial construct but as a cultural space rooted in the geography of the Mahabharata. London saw an opportunity to redraw borders. On 1 April 1937, the first of several imperial partitions was enacted and Aden was separated from India. \nA telegram from King George VI was read aloud:\n\"Aden has been an integral part of British Indian administration for nearly 100 years. That political association with my Indian Empire will now be broken, and Aden will take its place in my Colonial Empire.\"\nThe Gulf remained under the purview of the Government of India for another decade, however. \nBritish officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India.\"\nAs Gulf resident William Hay put it, \"it would clearly have been inappropriate to hand over responsibility for dealing with the Gulf Arabs to Indians or Pakistanis\". \nThe Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.\nMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. \nFew batted an eyelid, and 75 years on, the importance of what had just happened is still not fully understood in either India or the Gulf. \nWithout this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.\nWhen British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. So Britain retained its role in the Gulf for 24 more years, with an 'Arabian Raj' now reporting to Whitehall rather than to the Viceroy of India. \nIn the words of Gulf scholar Paul Rich, this was \"the Indian Empire's last redoubt, just as Goa was Portuguese India's last solitary vestige, or Pondicherry was the tag-end of French India\".\nThe official currency was still the Indian rupee; the easiest mode of transport was still the 'British India Line' (shipping company) and the 30 Arabian princely states were still governed by 'British residents' who had made their careers in the Indian Political Service.\nThe British only finally pulled out of the Gulf in 1971 as part of its decision to abandon colonial commitments east of Suez. \nAs David Holden wrote in July: \n\"For the first time since the heyday of Britain's East India Company, all the territories around the Gulf will be at liberty to seek their own salvation without the threat of British intervention, or the comfort of British protection. This final remnant of the British Raj - for that, in effect, is what it is \u2013 has been for some years now an obvious, if in some ways charming, anachronism \u2026 But its day is over.\"\nOf all the national narratives that emerged after the Empire's collapse, the Gulf states have been most successful at erasing their ties to British India. \nFrom Bahrain to Dubai, a past relationship with Britain is remembered, but governance from Delhi is not. The myth of an ancient sovereignty is crucial to keeping the monarchies alive. Yet private memories persist, particularly of the unimaginable class reversal that the Gulf has seen. \nIn 2009, Gulf scholar Paul Rich recorded an elderly Qatari gentleman who \"still got angry when he related to me the beating he received when as a young boy of seven or eight he stole an orange, a fruit which he had never seen before, from an Indian employee of the British agent\". \n\"The Indians, he said, were a privileged caste during his youth, and it gave him immense pleasure that the tables had turned and they now came to the Gulf as servants.\"\nToday Dubai, once a minor outpost of the Indian Empire with no gun salute, is the glittering centre of the new Middle East. \nFew of the millions of Indians or Pakistanis who live there know that there was a world in which India or Pakistan might have inherited the oil-rich Gulf, just as they did Jaipur, Hyderabad or Bahawalpur. \nA quiet bureaucratic decision, made in the twilight of empire, severed that link. Today, only the echoes remain.\nSam Dalrymple is the author of Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia",

        "article_text": "It was a killing that shocked India: Punjabi hip-hop star Sidhu Moose Wala shot dead through the windscreen of his car by hired gunmen.\nWithin hours, a Punjabi gangster named Goldy Brar had used Facebook to claim responsibility for ordering the hit.\nBut three years after the murder, no-one has faced trial - and Goldy Brar is still on the run, his whereabouts unknown.\nNow, BBC Eye has managed to make contact with Brar and challenged him about how and why Sidhu Moose Wala became a target.\nHis response was coldly articulate.\n\"In his arrogance, he [Moose Wala] made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,\"  Brar told the BBC World Service.\n\"We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that.\"\nOn a warm May evening in 2022, Sidhu Moose Wala was taking his black Mahindra Thar SUV for its usual spin through dusty lanes near his village in the northern Indian state of Punjab when, within minutes, two cars began tailing him.\nCCTV footage later showed them weaving through narrow turns, sticking close. Then, at a bend in the road, one of the vehicles lurched forward, cornering Moose Wala's SUV against a wall. He was trapped. Moments later, the shooting began.\nMobile footage captured the aftermath. His SUV was riddled with bullets, the windscreen shattered, the bonnet punctured.\nIn trembling voices, bystanders expressed their shock and concern.\n\"Someone get him out of the car.\"\n\"Get some water.\"\n\"Moose Wala has been shot.\"\nBut it was too late. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital - hit by 24 bullets, a post-mortem would later reveal. The 28-year-old rapper, one of modern-day Punjab's biggest cultural icons, had been gunned down in broad daylight.\nOutside the UK, watch on YouTube, or listen on BBC.com\nA cousin and a friend who had been in the car with Moose Wala at the time of the ambush were injured, but survived.\nSix gunmen were eventually identified. They carried AK-47s and pistols. In the weeks that followed the murder, about 30 people were arrested and two of the suspected armed men were killed in what the Indian police described as \"encounters\".\nYet even with arrests piling up, the motive remained murky.\nGoldy Brar, who claims to have ordered the hit, wasn't in India at the time of the killing. He is believed to have been in Canada.\nOur conversation with him unfolded over six hours, pieced together through an exchange of voice notes. It gave us a chance to find out why Moose Wala had been killed and to interrogate the motives of the man who claimed responsibility.\nSidhu Moose Wala was born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu in a Jat-Sikh family in rural Punjab, before moving in 2016 to Canada to study engineering - a journey familiar to hundreds of thousands in the Punjabi diaspora.\nBut it was there, far from his village of Moosa - the inspiration for his rap name - that he reinvented himself as one of Punjabi music's most influential artists. In just five years, Moose Wala became the unmistakable voice of Punjabi hip-hop.\nWith his signature swagger, flashy style, and lyrical grit, Moose Wala sang openly about identity and politics, guns and revenge, pushing the boundaries of what Punjabi music had been willing to say.\nHe was fascinated by rapper Tupac Shakur, who had been murdered, aged 25, in 1996. \"In terms of personality, I want to be like him,\" Moose Wala once told an interviewer. \"The day he died, people cried for him. I want the same. When I die, people should remember that I was someone.\"\nOver a brief but explosive career, the singer spotlighted the darker undercurrents of India's Punjab region - gangster culture, unemployment, and political decay - while evoking a deep nostalgia for village life.\nMoose Wala was also a global force. With more than five billion views of his music videos on YouTube, a Top 5 spot in the UK charts, and collaborations with international hip-hop artists including Burna Boy, Moose Wala swiftly built a fan base stretching across India, Canada, the UK and beyond, powered by a diaspora that saw him as both icon and insurgent.\nBut fame came at a cost. Despite his rising star and socially conscious lyrics, Moose Wala was drifting into dangerous territory. His defiant attitude, visibility, and growing influence had drawn the attention of Punjab's most feared gangsters. These included Goldy Brar, and Brar's friend Lawrence Bishnoi, who even then was in a high-security jail in India.\nNot much is known about Brar, apart from the fact he is on the Interpol Red Notice list, and is a key operative in a network of gangsters operated by Bishnoi \u2013 orchestrating hits, issuing threats and amplifying the gang's reach. It is thought he emigrated to Canada in 2017, just a year after Moose Wala himself, and initially worked as a truck driver.\nBishnoi, once a student leader steeped in Punjab's violent campus politics, has grown into one of India's most feared criminal masterminds.\n\"The first [police] cases filed against Lawrence Bishnoi were all related to student politics and student elections\u2026 beating a rival student leader, kidnapping him, harming him,\" according to Jupinderjit Singh, deputy editor of Indian newspaper the Tribune.\nThis led to a spell in jail which hardened him further, says Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, Assistant Inspector General of the Anti-Gangster Task Force of Punjab Police.\n\"Once he was in jail, he started to get deeper into crime. Then he formed a group of his own. When it became an inter-gang thing, he needed money for survival. They need more manpower, they need more weapons. They need money for all that. So, for money, you have to get into extortion or crime.\"\nNow 31, Bishnoi runs his syndicate from behind bars - with dedicated Instagram pages and a cult-like following.\n\"So while Bishnoi sits in jail, Brar handles the gangs,\" says Assistant Inspector General Chauhan.\nSecuring BBC Eye's exchange with Brar took a year of chasing - cultivating sources, waiting for replies, gradually getting closer to the kingpin himself. But when we got through to Brar, the conversation cast new light on the question of how and why he and Bishnoi came to see Moose Wala as an enemy.\nOne of the first revelations was that Bishnoi's relationship with Moose Wala went back several years, long before the singer's killing.\n\"Lawrence [Bishnoi] was in touch with Sidhu [Moose Wala]. I don't know who introduced them, and I never asked. But they did speak,\" said Brar.\n\"Sidhu used to send 'good morning' and 'good night' messages in an effort to flatter Lawrence.\"\nA friend of Moose Wala's, who spoke anonymously, also told us that Bishnoi had been in touch with Moose Wala as early as 2018, calling him from jail and telling him he liked his music.\nBrar told us that the \"first dispute\" between them came after Moose Wala had moved back to India. It began with a seemingly innocuous match of kabbadi - a traditional South Asian contact team sport - in a Punjabi village.\nMoose Wala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang - Brar told us, in a sport where match-fixing and gangster influence are rampant.\n\"That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\nYet the dispute between Moose Wala and Bishnoi was eventually resolved by an associate of Bishnoi's called Vicky Middhukhera.\nBut when Middukhera himself was gunned down by gangsters in a parking lot in Mohali in August 2021, Brar told us Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moose Wala reached the point of no return.\nThe Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moose Wala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moose Wala denied any involvement.\nThe Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moose Wala to the killing or to any gang-related crime. But Moose Wala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang - a perception that may have cost him his life.\nAlthough he can cite no proof of Moose Wala's involvement, Brar remains convinced that the singer was somehow complicit in the killing of Middukhera. Brar repeatedly told us that Shaganpreet Singh had assisted the gunmen in the days before Middukhera's shooting - and inferred that Moose Wala himself must have been involved.\n\"Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\n\"We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea.\n\"So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard.\"\nWe put it to Brar that India has a judicial system and the rule of law - how could he justify taking the law into his own hands?\n\"Law. Justice. There's no such thing,\" he says. \"Only the powerful can... [obtain] justice, not ordinary people like us.\"\nHe went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system.\n\"He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going.\"\nHe appeared unrepentant.\n\"I did what I had to do for my brother. \u202fI have no remorse whatsoever.\"\nThe killing of Moose Wala has not just resulted in the loss of a major musical talent, it has also emboldened Punjab's gangsters.\nBefore the singer's murder, few outside Punjab had heard of Bishnoi or Brar.\nAfter the killing, their names were everywhere. They hijacked Moose Wala's fame and converted it into their own brand of notoriety - a notoriety that became a powerful tool for extortion.\n\"This is the biggest killing that has happened in the last few decades in Punjab,\" says Ritesh Lakhi, a Punjab-based journalist. \"The capacity of gangsters to extort money has gone up. [Goldy Brar]'s getting huge sums of money after killing Moose Wala.\"\nJournalist Jupinderjit Singh agrees: \"The fear factor around gangsters has risen amongst the public.\" \nExtortion has long been a problem in the Punjabi music industry, but now after Sidhu's murder, Singh says: \"It's not just people in the music and film industry who are being extorted - even local businessmen are receiving calls.\"\nWhen BBC Eye quizzed Brar on this, he denied this was the motive, but did admit - in stark terms - that extortion was central to the gang's working.\n\"To feed a family of four a man has to struggle all his life. We have to look after hundreds or even thousands of people who are like family to us. We have to extort people.\n\"To get money,\" he says, \"we have to be feared.\"",

        "article_text": "As the annual Hajj pilgrimage draws to a close, a long-settled corner of Mecca is stirring up a storm thousands of miles away in India - not for its spiritual significance, but for a 50-year-old inheritance dispute.\nAt the heart of the controversy is Keyi Rubath, a 19th-Century guest house built in the 1870s by Mayankutty Keyi, a wealthy Indian merchant from Malabar (modern-day Kerala), whose trading empire stretched from Mumbai to Paris.\nLocated near Islam's holiest site, Masjid al-Haram, the building was demolished in 1971 to make way for Mecca's expansion. Saudi authorities deposited 1.4 million riyals (about $373,000 today) in the kingdom's treasury as compensation, but said no rightful heir could be identified at the time.\nDecades later, that sum - still held in Saudi Arabia's treasury - has sparked a bitter  tussle between two sprawling branches of the Keyi family, each trying to prove its lineage and claim what they see as their rightful inheritance.\nNeither side has succeeded so far. For decades, successive Indian governments - both at the Centre and in Kerala - have tried and failed to resolve the deadlock.\nIt remains unclear if Saudi authorities are even willing to release the compensation, let alone adjust it for inflation as some family members now demand -  with some claiming it could be worth over $1bn today. \nFollowers of the case note the property was a waqf - an Islamic charitable endowment - meaning descendants can manage but not own it.\nThe Saudi department that handles Awqaf (endowed properties) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, and the government has made no public statement on the matter.\nThat hasn't stopped speculation - about both the money and who it rightfully belongs to.\nLittle is known about the guest house itself, but descendants claim it stood just steps from the Masjid al-Haram, with 22 rooms and several halls spread over 1.5 acres. \nAccording to family lore, Keyi shipped wood from Malabar to build it and appointed a Malabari manager to run it - an ambitious gesture, though not unusual for the time. \nSaudi Arabia was a relatively poor country back then - the discovery of its massive oil fields still a few decades away.\nThe Hajj pilgrimage and the city's importance in Islam meant that Indian Muslims often donated money or built infrastructure for Indian pilgrims there.\nIn his 2014 book, Mecca: The Sacred City, historian Ziauddin Sardar notes that during the second half of the 18th Century, the city had acquired a distinctively Indian character with its economy and financial well-being dependent on Indian Muslims.\n\"Almost 20% of the city's inhabitants, the largest single majority, were now of Indian origins \u2013 people from Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir and Deccan, all collectively known locally as the Hindis,\" Sardar wrote.\nAs Saudi Arabia's oil wealth surged in the 20th century, sweeping development projects reshaped Mecca. Keyi Rubath was demolished three times, the final time in the early 1970s.\nThat's when the confusion around compensation appears to have started. \nAccording to BM Jamal, former secretary of India's Central Waqf Council, the Indian consulate in Jeddah wrote to the government back then, seeking details of Mayankutty Keyi's legal heir. \n\"In my understanding, authorities were looking for the descendants to appoint a manager for the property, not to distribute the compensation money,\" Mr Jamal said.\nNonetheless, two factions stepped forward: the Keyis - Mayankutty's paternal family - and the Arakkals, a royal family from Kerala into which he had married. \nBoth families traditionally followed a matrilineal inheritance system -  a custom not recognized under Saudi law, adding further complexity.\nThe Keyis claim that Mayankutty died childless, making his sister's children his rightful heirs under matrilineal tradition. \nBut the Arakkals claim he had a son and a daughter, and therefore, under Indian law, his children would be the legal inheritors.\nAs the dispute dragged on, the story took on a life of its own. In 2011, after rumours swirled that the compensation could be worth millions, more than 2,500 people flooded a district office in Kannur, claiming to be Keyi's descendants.\n\"There were people who claimed that their forefathers had taught Mayankutty in his childhood. Others claimed that their forefathers had provided timber for the guest house,\" a senior Keyi family member, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC.\nScams followed. State officials say in 2017 fraudsters posing as Keyi descendants duped locals into handing over money, promising a share of the compensation.  \nToday, the case remains unresolved. \nSome descendants propose the best way to end the dispute would be to ask the Saudi government to use the compensation money to build another guest house for Hajj pilgrims, as Myankutti Keyi had intended.\nBut others reject this, arguing that the guest house was privately owned, and so any compensation rightfully belongs to the family.\nSome argue that even if the family proves lineage to Mayankutty Keyi, without ownership documents, they're unlikely to gain anything.\nFor Muhammed Shihad, a Kannur resident who has co-authored a book on the history of the Keyi and Arakkal families, though, the dispute is not just about the money - but about honouring the family's roots. \n\"If they don't get the compensation, it would be worth openly recognising the family's and the region's connection to this noble act.\"",

        "article_text": "Nearly three weeks after Rohit Sharma's sudden retirement from Test cricket, the Indian cricket board has ended speculation of his successor by naming Shubman Gill as India's new captain for the upcoming five-Test series against England in June.\nAt 25, Gill becomes India's 37th Test captain - and one of its youngest, after Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri.\nHis appointment marks a turning point for Indian cricket. The squad he leads is without batting greats Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, spin stalwart R Ashwin who retired six months ago, and pace spearhead Mohammed Shami, who was sidelined due to fitness concerns.\nThe team is rich in young batting talent but will miss the experience of Kohli and Sharma. Despite Jaspreet Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, and Mohammad Siraj, the bowling attack still feels a touch raw. \nAdding to Gill's challenge: India haven't won a Test series in England since 2007.\nHis appointment followed intense deliberations between chief selector Ajit Agarkar, coach Gautam Gambhir, and backchannel talks with other contenders.\nThough Bumrah seemed the natural choice after serving as vice-captain in Australia, concerns over his ability to shoulder the workload of a five-Test series tipped the scales in Gill's favour.\nA prodigy from Punjab state, Gill has long carried the weight of expectation with elegance.\nHe burst into the spotlight in 2014, not yet 15, hammering 351 in a world-record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh in the Punjab Inter-District ML Markan Trophy. It was a knock that vindicated his family's bold move from the border village of Chak Kherewala to Mohali, seeking better training and greater exposure for the young talent.\nConsistent run-getting as a junior, fast-tracked him into the under-19 ranks which is where Gill really made his first big impact.\nVice-captain of the team that played the 2017-18 U-19 World Cup, he emerged as the top run aggregator for India, highlighted by a skilful, unbeaten 102 against arch rivals Pakistan in the semi-final. In the final where India beat Australia, Gill scored a handy 31.\nAt the time, all eyes were on Prithvi Shaw - the U-19 captain whose Mumbai schoolboy feats drew comparisons with Tendulkar. His rise was meteoric: a Test debut century, another soon after. But by 2020, his career had begun to unravel.\nTemporarily sidelined, Gill made an immediate impact on his Ranji Trophy debut with a half-century, followed by a century. Under Yuvraj Singh's mentorship, he sharpened both his batting and game awareness.\nProlific runs pushed selectors to consider Gill as Shaw's replacement. He debuted in Tests in Melbourne, December 2020, during India's memorable comeback series win.\nTall and graceful, Gill's technical precision and elegant stroke play - especially front of the wicket - set him apart as a promising young talent. Nicknamed the 'Prince' by his family, the title soon became his cricketing identity. Hailed as the Next Big Thing, he's widely tipped to succeed Virat Kohli as the next generation's leading batsman.\nThat promise remains unproven. Like Kohli, Gill is an all-format player, but unlike Kohli's early dominance, Gill has yet to display the same ambition and match-winning impact - especially in Tests, where his 1,893 runs in 32 matches are solid but not outstanding.\n\nGill's first captaincy, less than five years after his Test debut, comes at a crucial point in his career.\nWith enough international experience to elevate his batting from good to great, he now faces a stern test against England's Bazball style of play in challenging conditions. Success here would be a major boost to his standing as a top Test player.\nBut it is as captain that Gill probably faces tougher challenges.\nThe England series kicked off India's new World Test Championship cycle, following two finals appearances but a disappointing early exit in the last one. India's recent Test form has been poor, with back-to-back series losses to New Zealand and Australia.\nTo pull India out of the current rut, Gill will have to lead the way as batter as well as captain in charge of a new-look team, whose dressing-room and dynamics he will have to understand and, perhaps, reshape.\n\"Gill is a young man we are investing in not just for one series, but for the next five-six years to take Indian cricket ahead,'' said chief selector Ajit Agarkar.\nThat should be a tremendous reassurance for the new captain. While his appointment brings its share of pressure, it also carries immense hope - and an opportunity to carve his own legacy in Indian cricket history.",

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition at the British Museum in London showcases the rich journey of India's spiritual art. Titled Ancient India: Living Traditions, it brings together 189 remarkable objects spanning centuries.\nVisitors can explore everything from 2,000-year-old sculptures and paintings to intricate narrative panels and manuscripts, revealing the stunning evolution of spiritual expression in India.\nArt from the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound transformation between 200BC and AD600. The imagery which depicted gods, goddesses, supreme preachers and enlightened souls of three ancient religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - was reimagined from symbolic to more recognisably deriving from human form.\nWhile the three religions shared common cultural roots - worshipping ancient nature spirits such as potent serpents or the feisty peafowl - they negotiated dramatic shifts in religious iconography during this pivotal period which continues to have contemporary relevance two millennia apart.\n\"Today we can't imagine the veneration of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divine spirits or deities without a human form, can we? Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "It was a balmy Thursday afternoon at the residential hostel of the BJ Medical College and the canteen was teeming with students getting lunch.\nThe room buzzed with the sound of jokes, banter between friends, and the odd bit of academic discussion.\nBy 13:39 local time, there were at least 35 people in the cafeteria. Some had already collected their food and were lounging around, while others were in the queue waiting for their turn.\nThe students mixed with doctors and family members. Then, everything changed. \nThe general hum of the canteen was pierced by the sound of approaching jet engines - and then the room exploded.\nLess than a minute earlier, Flight AI171 had taken off from the runway at Ahmedabad's airport, just 1.5km (4,800ft) away.\nThe Air India 787 Dreamliner was bound for London, carrying 242 people.\nBut something had gone catastrophically wrong, and mere seconds after its wheels left the ground, the plane was in trouble. A mayday call was sent before it came crashing down into a busy residential area - on top of the doctors' hostel - sending a massive fireball into the sky and killing all but one person on board.\nThe BBC has spoken to eyewitnesses, including students who were in the hostel, along with friends of the trainee doctors who died and their teachers, to piece together what happened in those terrifying few seconds - and the aftermath that followed.\nPeople on the ground nearby couldn't immediately work out what had happened.\nA doctor, who works with the college's kidney sciences department, says he and his colleagues were in their building, about 500 metres away, when they heard a \"deafening sound\" outside.\n\"At first, we thought it was lightning. But then we wondered, could that be possible in 40C dry heat?\"\nThe doctors ran outside.\nThat's when they heard a few people screaming: \"Look, come here, a plane has crashed into our building.\"\nThe next few minutes were a blur. Scenes of chaos descended on the campus as people ran around trying to escape - or find out what had happened.\nBrothers Prince and Krish Patni were on their bikes just a few metres from the hostel when they heard the noise.\n\"Within seconds we could see something that resembled a wing of a plane,\" Prince, 18, told the BBC.\n\"We rushed to the scene, but the heat from the explosion was intense and we couldn't enter the hostel. There was a lot of debris.\"\nThe brothers, along with a few other volunteers from the local area, waited for the heat to subside before attempting to physically enter the building. They worked together with the police to move some of the debris from the entrance.\nWhen they finally reached the canteen, they couldn't see anyone.\nDark, dense clouds of smoke had engulfed the room. The air smelled of burned metal. The brothers, who just minutes before had been heading to play cricket, began removing cooking gas cylinders to avoid any further explosions, Krish, 20, explained.\nThe brothers and other volunteers then spotted a pile of suitcases and went to move them. What unfolded next, they said, was gut wrenching.\nBehind them, they began to make out the shapes of people.\nMost were alive. Some had spoons full of food in their hand, some had plates of food in front of them, and some had glasses in their hand.\nThey were all badly injured.\nThey were also silent, in shock. Just minutes before they were having their usual afternoon. Now, they were surrounded by charred metal pieces of aircraft.\n\"They didn't even get a chance to react,\" another doctor, who was in a nearby building, said.\nA second year student, who lives in the hostel, was among those who managed to escape.\nHe was sitting at his usual spot - a large table at the corner of the mess, next to one of the walls - with nine others when the plane crashed.\n\"There was a huge bang and a horrible screeching sound. Next thing we knew, we were under huge boulders, stuck without anywhere to go,\" he says. \"The fire and smoke of the crashed plane was close to our face and it was hard to breathe.\"\nHe received severe chest wounds in the accident and is still undergoing treatment at a local hospital. And he doesn't know what happened to his friends.\nMultiple eyewitnesses told the BBC the massive wing of the plane first pierced through the roof followed by parts of the fuselage. The damage was most severe where the wing fell.\nIn the chaos, students began to jump from as high as the second and third floors to escape. Students later told how one of the only staircases out was blocked by debris.\nIt is not known how many people were killed on the ground.\nDr Minakshi Parikh, dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, told the BBC that four of their students had died, as well as four students' relatives.\nBut exactly how many and who was killed may take days to establish: investigators need to rely on DNA to formally identify the bodies found in the wreckage.\nAnd it was not just people in the canteen at that moment who were killed.\nJust a few kilometres away was Ravi Thakur, who worked in the hostel kitchen. He had gone out to deliver lunch boxes in other hostels around the city. His mother and two-year-old son stayed behind as usual.\nWhen he heard the news, he rushed back but found utter chaos. Around 45 minutes had passed and the place was full of locals, firefighters, ambulance workers and Air India staff.\nHe tried to look for his mother but couldn't find her.\nBack at the main hospital block, teachers are still trying make sense of the chaos.\n\"I used to teach these students and knew them personally. The injured students are still being treated in the hospital, and they are our priority at the moment,\" one professor at the college told the BBC.\nMeanwhile, Ravi Thakur is still searching for his loved one, even as his hopes fade fast.",

Her relatives and supporters say they have raised $1m (\u00a3735,000) and offered it to Mahdi's family.\n\"We are still trying to save her. But ultimately the family has to agree for pardon,\" Babu John, a member of the Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, told the BBC last week after the date for her execution was set.\nMahdi's family, however, have made clear that they will settle for nothing less than her being put to death.\n\"Our stance on the attempts at reconciliation is clear; we insist on implementing God's Law in Qisas [retaliation in kind], nothing else,\" his brother, Abdelfattah Mahdi, told BBC Arabic on Monday, before the execution was postponed.\nHe added that his family had suffered \"not only from the brutal crime but also the long, exhausting litigation process in a horrible and heinous but obvious crime case\".\n\"We feel sorry to see the attempts to distort the truth, especially from the Indian media that portrays the convicted as a victim, to justify the crime. And we say it clearly that they are aiming to influence public opinion,\" he said.\n\"Any dispute, whatever its reasons and however big, can never justify a murder - let alone dismembering, mutilating and hiding the body.\"\n\nThe Indian foreign ministry sources said on Tuesday that its officials had been in touch regularly with jail authorities and the prosecutor's office in Yemen, where there has been a civil war since 2011.\nThe government \"made concerted efforts in recent days to seek more time for the family of Ms Nimisha Priya to reach a mutually agreeable solution with the other party\", they said.\nNimisha Priya left Kerala for Yemen in 2008 to work as a nurse. She was arrested in 2017 after Mahdi's body was discovered. The 34-year-old is presently lodged in the central jail in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital.\nIn 2020, a local court sentenced her to death. Her family challenged the decision in Yemen's Supreme Court, but their appeal was rejected in 2023.\nIn early January, Mahdi al-Mashat, president of the rebel Houthis' Supreme Political Council, approved her execution.\nNimisha's mother, a poor domestic helper from Kerala, has been in Yemen since April 2024 in a last-ditch effort to save her. \nShe has nominated Samuel Jerome, a Yemen-based social worker, to negotiate with Mahdi's family.  \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Tesla - we are not expecting from them,\" Kumaraswamy said. \nAnother official told the Press Trust of India news agency that a Tesla representative had participated in the first round of stakeholder discussions for the manufacturing scheme but  \"was not part of the second and third round\".\nThe comments come on the back of US President Donald Trump saying in February that it would be \"unfair\" for the US if Tesla built a factory in India. \nOver the years Tesla has had several rounds of negotiations to enter India.\nThe company's original plans to open a base were shelved in 2022 after the Indian government insisted that Tesla make cars locally.

This came after Musk complained that high import duties were preventing the carmaker from entering India. \nBut analysts say the Indian EV market may not be mature enough yet for Tesla to invest locally - EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India, and locally made alternatives can cost half of what consumers will have to shell out for Tesla's base model. \nCharging infrastructure and local road conditions could be further deterrents. \nIndia's Tata Motors currently leads India's EV market with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. \nGlobally, Tesla has been facing growing competition from Chinese players such as BYD. \nIts sales plummeted to their lowest level in three years in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk and his role in the Trump administration. \nMusk announced his departure from his government role last week.

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Fuel to the engines of the Air India plane involved in a deadly crash was cut off moments after takeoff, a preliminary report has found.\nIn recovered cockpit voice recordings, the report said one of the pilots can be heard asking \"why did you cut off?\" - to which the other pilot replied he \"did not do so\".\nThe London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed less than a minute after taking off on 12 June from Ahmedabad airport in western India, killing 260 people, most of them passengers. One British national miraculously survived the crash. \nAn investigation led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is ongoing, with a final, more detailed report expected in 12 months.\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, both of the plane's fuel control switches moved from the run to the cutoff position in the space of a second, shortly after takeoff.\nThe switches are usually only cut off to turn off the engines after landing, or during emergency situations such as an engine fire - rather than during takeoff.\nThe cutoff caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report said.\nThere is then confusion heard in the cockpit, with one pilot asking the other why they had switched off the fuel, which the other denied. The Gatwick-bound plane was being piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar. The report does not specify which voice is which.\nThe fuel switches then moved back into their normal inflight position, automatically starting the process of relighting the engines. One engine, the report said, was able to regain thrust - but could not reverse the plane's deceleration. \nOne of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane plummeted and crashed into a building used as doctors' accommodation, causing an explosion.\nBoth pilots had an \"adequate rest period prior\" to the flight, the report said.\nExperts had previously speculated that birds could have caused the crash, but the report said that \"no significant bird activity\" was observed in the vicinity of the plane's flight path.\nThe report said: \"At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers\".\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin in 2019 highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged, the report said.\nThe issue was not deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation.\nThe same switch design is used in Air India's VT-ANB aircraft which crashed. As the bulletin was advisory, Air India did not perform inspections. \nThere had been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB, the report said.\nExperts who spoke to the BBC offered differing opinions on whether this could have played a factor.\nAn Air India spokesperson said the airline acknowledged receipt of the preliminary report.\n\"We continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses. Given the active nature of the investigation, we are unable to comment on specific details and refer all such enquiries to the AAIB,\" the Air India spokesperson added.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it would defer to AAIB to provide information about the crashed plane, in adherence with protocol under the UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It also said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board in a statement thanked Indian officials for their cooperation and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing-787 jets or the GE engines.\nWhile no conclusions are drawn and the report notes that investigations are ongoing, the focus appears to be on the actions of the pilots.\nThe preliminary investigation into the crash - one of the worst in recent aviation history - was led by the AAIB, with inputs from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India, and aviation regulators from India, the UK and the US.\nUnder ICAO rules, preliminary reports should be filed within 30 days of a crash, although it isn't mandatory to make them public. \nThe accident marked the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner suffered a fatal crash since entering service in 2011.\nIn the days following the crash, the aircraft's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or \"black boxes\" - were recovered from the debris, a crucial breakthrough for investigators looking to reconstruct the flight's final moments.\nThese devices capture extensive flight data and cockpit audio - from pilot radio calls to ambient cockpit sounds.\nThe crash is a major setback for Air India, which is in the middle of a business turnaround following its privatisation. It was bought out by the Tata Group from the Indian government in 2022.\nThe airline has announced a cut in international operations on its wide-body aircraft as it grapples with several disruptions in the aftermath of the crash.\nThe tragedy has also put the spotlight on aviation safety in India.\nEarlier this month, India's civil aviation regulator completed enhanced safety checks on 26 out of Air India's 33 Dreamliners without finding major concerns.\nSpeaking to the BBC this week, the chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) - India's aviation safety regulator - defended the country's record, saying that between 2010 and 2024 it consistently performed better than the world average when it came to the number of accidents annually, except for in two years in which major accidents happened.\nHowever, there have been a number of disquieting reports in recent weeks, highlighting maintenance oversights and training shortfalls.",

One of the pilots submitted a mayday call just before the plane plummeted and crashed into a building used as doctors' accommodation, causing an explosion.Both pilots had an \"adequate rest period prior\" to the flight, the report said.Experts had previously speculated that birds could have caused the crash, but the report said that \"no significant bird activity\" was observed in the vicinity of the plane's flight path.The report said: \"At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers\".The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin in 2019 highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged, the report said.The issue was not deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive - a legally enforceable regulation.The same switch design is used in Air India's VT-ANB aircraft which crashed. It also said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India.The US National Transportation Safety Board in a statement thanked Indian officials for their cooperation and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing-787 jets or the GE engines.While no conclusions are drawn and the report notes that investigations are ongoing, the focus appears to be on the actions of the pilots.The preliminary investigation into the crash - one of the worst in recent aviation history - was led by the AAIB, with inputs from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India, and aviation regulators from India, the UK and the US.Under ICAO rules, preliminary reports should be filed within 30 days of a crash, although it isn't mandatory to make them public.

The left engine was last serviced in 2023 and due for its next maintenance check in December 2025,\" he told Times Now channel. \nAt least 270 people, most of them passengers, were killed last Thursday when AI171, a London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed less than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad airport in western India.\nInvestigators are now sifting through debris and decoding recorded flight data and cockpit audio - from the aircraft's black boxes which have been found - to reconstruct the flight's final moments and determine the cause of the incident.\n\"There are a lot of speculations and a lot of theories. But the fact that I know so far is this particular aircraft, this specific tail, AI171, has a clean history,\" Mr Chandrasekaran said, cautioning people against jumping to conclusions.\n\"I am told by all the experts that the black box and recorders will definitely tell the story. So, we just have to wait for that,\" he added.\nKishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, told the BBC that the condition of an aircraft engine is not necessarily linked to its age - particularly in the case of the Genx-1B engines used on the Boeing 787-8.\n\"The age of the engine has no bearing on the health of the engine, especially for the Genx-1B engines,\" Mr Chinta said. In other words just because an engine is new, does not necessarily mean it is healthy, or vice versa. \nUnlike older models, the Genx-1B engines, which are made by GE Aerospace, don't follow a fixed overhaul or maintenance schedule. Instead, they are equipped with a system called the Full Authority Digital Engine Control or FADEC that continuously monitors engine health and performance. The decision to service or replace the engine is based on this data and physical inspections.\nHowever, Mr Chinta pointed out that certain components of the engine, known as Life Limited Parts (LLPs), still have a fixed lifespan typically between 15,000 and 20,000 cycles.\n\"Every start and switch-off of the engine counts as one cycle,\" he explained.\nWhile the investigation continues, Air India has also announced a 15% cut in its international operations on wide-body aircraft until mid-July as it grapples with the fallout from the crash.\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the decision was driven by \"compounding circumstances\" - including enhanced safety checks, increased caution by crew and ground staff and tensions in the Middle East.\nSeparately, the airline said that inspections have been completed on 26 of its 33 Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft, all of which have been \"cleared for service\". \nIndia's aviation regulator had ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet after the deadly crash as a \"preventive measure\".\nThe remaining aircraft are expected to be examined in the coming days, Air India said, adding that the airline's Boeing 777 fleet would also \"undertake enhanced safety checks\".\n\"The curtailments are a painful measure to take, but are necessary following a devastating event which we are still working through and an unusual combination of external events,\" it said. \nMeanwhile some experts say the crash will likely have an impact on Air India as it tries to transform from a troubled state-owned carrier to a privately-owned company. \nTata Sons, a conglomerate which also owns big brands like Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover, bought the airline - formerly India's national carrier - from the Indian government in 2022. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "\"Who is responsible for this mess?\"\nThe question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated.\nHeavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours. \nEven a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral. \nThe pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\nFollowing criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late.\nThe crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai.\nFrom Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt.\nExperts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem. \n\"The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,\" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi.\n\"Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,\" he adds.\nExperts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses.\nIndia receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September.\nThe monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent.\nBut experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people.\nThis year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared. \n\"A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,\" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. \nIn Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding.\nThis year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department. \nMany residents reported damage to their property. \nAt least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports.\nMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same. \nOnce known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding.\n\"Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,\" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist.\nThese valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says. \n\"When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.\" \nMr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made.\nViolations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides.\nBut experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain.\n\"The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,\" Mr Kukerja says. \"Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience.\"\nThis isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more. \nOver the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way. \nSo, can anything be done to prevent this?\n\"Yes,\" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy.\nHe suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses.\n\"But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,\" he said.\nFor India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

It is expected to splash down in just under 24 hours. \nLed by former Nasa veteran Peggy Whitson and piloted by Group Captain Shukla, Ax-4 had arrived at ISS on 26 June. Its crew included Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.\nGroup Captain Shukla is only the second Indian to have gone to space. His trip came 41 years after cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma flew aboard a Russian Soyuz in 1984.\nAx-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private firm Axiom Space - is a collaboration between Nasa, India's space agency Isro, European Space Agency (Esa) and SpaceX. \nOn Monday, ISS posted on X that the Ax-4 crew had taken their places in the spacecraft and its hatches had been closed. The undocking of the craft - when it separated from the ISS - was broadcast live. \nAxiom Space said the craft would splash down in the ocean off the coast of California and a vessel would then pick it up.\nIndian Science Minister Jitendra Singh has said the splash down is scheduled for 15 July at approximately 15:00 India time (09:30 GMT).\nIn his farewell address from aboard the ISS on Sunday, the Indian astronaut said India's journey in space exploration may be tough, but it has begun.\n\"It has been an incredible journey. Even though now it is coming to an end, for you and me there is a long way to go. The journey of our human space mission is very long and difficult. But if we are determined, even the stars are attainable.\"\nHe referred to India's first man in space cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma famously quoting from a 1924 Urdu song \"Sare jahan se achcha\" to say \"India looked better than the rest of the world\".\n\"Even today we want to know how it looks from space. I'll tell you. From space, today's India looks ambitious. It looks fearless. It looks confident. It looks proud. And so, I can once again say that today's India still looks better than the rest of the world,\" Group Captain Shukla said. \nAx-4, which was originally expected to spend two weeks on the ISS, ended up staying a few days longer. During their stay, Axiom Space said the crew conducted 60 scientific experiments, including seven designed by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).\nIsro, which had paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla on Ax-4 and his training, has said the hands-on experience he gains during his trip to the ISS will help India in its human space flights.\nIsro has announced plans to launch Gaganyaan - the country's first-ever human space flight in 2027 - and has ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nGroup Captain Shukla is among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on Gaganyaan.\nBorn on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the air force as a fighter pilot in 2006.\nHe has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks and has more than 2,000 hours of flying experience.\nBefore flying into space, Group Captain Shukla described the past year as \"nothing short of transformative\".\n\"It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Long before India gained independence, one defiant voice inside the British Empire dared to call out a colonial massacre - and paid a price for it.\nSir Chettur Sankaran Nair, a lawyer, was one of the few Indians to be appointed to top government posts when the British ruled the country.   \nIn 1919, he resigned from the Viceroy's Council after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in the northern Indian city of Amritsar in Punjab, in which hundreds of civilians attending a public meeting were shot dead by British troops. On the 100th anniversary of the massacre, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May described the tragedy as a \"shameful scar\" on Britain's history in India.\nNair's criticism of Punjab's then Lieutenant Governor, Michael O'Dwyer, led to a libel case against him, which helped spotlight the massacre and the actions of British officials.\nIn a biography of Nair, KPS Menon, independent India's first foreign secretary, described him as \"a very controversial figure of his time\". \nNair was known for his independent views and distaste for extremist politics, and spoke critically of colonial rule and even of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian independence hero who is now regarded as the father of the nation. \nMenon, who married Nair's daughter Saraswathy, wrote: \"Only [Nair] could have insulted the all powerful British Viceroy on his face and opposed Mahatma Gandhi openly.\"\nNair was not a familiar name in India in recent decades, but earlier this year, a Bollywood film based on the court case, Kesari Chapter 2- starring superstar Akshay Kumar - helped bring attention to his life.\nNair was born in 1857 into a wealthy family in what is now Palakkad district in Kerala state. He studied at the Presidency College in Madras, acquiring a bachelor's degree before studying law and beginning his career as an apprentice with a Madras High Court judge.\nIn 1887, he joined the social reform movement in the Madras presidency. Throughout his career, he fought to reform Hindu laws of the time on marriage and women's rights and to abolish the caste system.\nFor some years, he was a delegate to the Indian National Congress and presided over its 1897 session in Amraoti (Amravati). In his address, he held the British-run government \"morally responsible for the extreme poverty of the masses\", saying the annual famines \"claimed more victims and created more distress than under any civilised government anywhere else in the world\". \nHe was appointed public prosecutor in 1899 and writes in his autobiography about advising the government on seditious articles in newspapers, including those by his close friend G Subramania Iyer, the first editor of The Hindu newspaper. \"On many occasions\u2026 I was able to persuade them not to take any step against him.\"\nHe became a high court judge in 1908 and was knighted four years later.\nNair moved to Delhi in 1915 when he was appointed a member of the Viceroy's Council, only the third Indian to hold the position. \nHe was a fierce proponent of India's right to govern itself and pushed for constitutional reforms during his time on the council. Through 1918 and 1919, his dissent and negotiations with Edwin Montagu, then secretary of state for India, helped expand provisions of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms which laid out how India would gradually achieve self-governance.\nMontagu wrote in his diary that he had been warned \"that it was absolutely necessary to get him on my side, for Sankaran Nair wielded more influence than any other Indian\".\nA pivotal moment in Nair's career as a statesman was the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh, when hundreds of unarmed Indians were shot dead in a public garden on the day of the Baisakhi festival. Official estimates said nearly 400 people were killed and more than 1,500 wounded by the soldiers, who fired under the orders of Brigadier General REH Dyer. Indian sources put the death toll closer to 1,000.\nNair writes in his 1922 book Gandhi and Anarchy about following the events in Punjab with increasing concern. The shooting at Jallianwala Bagh was part of a larger crackdown in the province, where martial law had been introduced - the region was cut off from the rest of the country and no newspapers were allowed into it.\n\"If to govern the country, it is necessary that innocent persons should be slaughtered at Jallianwala Bagh and that any Civilian Officer may, at any time, call in the military and the two together may butcher the people as at Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in,\" he wrote.\nA month later, he resigned from the council and left for Britain, where he hoped to rouse public opinion on the massacre.\nIn his memoir, Nair writes of speaking to the editor of The Westminster Gazette which soon published an article called the Amritsar Massacre. Other papers including The Times also followed suit.\n\"Worse things had happened under British rule, but I am glad I was able to obtain publicity for this one at least,\" Nair wrote.\nNair's book Gandhi and Anarchy drew the ire of several Indian nationalists of the time after he criticised Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, calling it a \"weapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our purpose\".\nBut it was the few passages condemning Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, that became the basis for the libel suit against him in 1924. \nNair accused O'Dwyer of terrorism, holding him responsible for the atrocities committed by the civil government before the imposition of martial law. \nA five-week trial in the Court of King's Bench in London ruled 11:1 in favour of O'Dwyer, awarding damages of \u00a3500 and \u00a37,000 in costs to him.\nO'Dwyer offered to forgo this for an apology but Nair refused and paid instead.\nReports of the depositions in the hearing were published daily in The Times. Nair's family says despite losing, the case achieved his purpose of having the atrocities brought to public attention. \nNair's great-grandson Raghu Palat, who co-wrote the book The Case That Shook the Empire, with his wife Pushpa, says the case helped spark \"an uproar for the freedom movement\".\nIt also showed that \"there was no point in having a dominion status under the empire when the British cannot be expected to deal with their subjects fairly\", adds Pushpa.\nEven Gandhi referred to the case several times, writing once that Nair had showed pluck in fighting without hope of victory, historian PC Roy Chaudhury later pointed out.\nAfter losing the case, Nair continued with his career in India. He was chairman of the Indian Committee of the Simon Commission, which reviewed the working of constitutional reforms in India in 1928.\nHe died in 1934 at the age of 77.\nThrough his career, Menon notes, Nair \"bent all his thoughts and energies on the emancipation of his country from the bondage of foreign domination and native custom. In this task, he achieved as much success as any man, wedded to constitutional methods\".",

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Days after the devastating Air India-171 crash killed at least 270 people, investigators from across the world are putting their heads together to find out what exactly went wrong. So far, there is no indication of where the fault lies, and it could take months before we have an answer. \nBut as the waiting game begins, the Tata Group - which owns the airline along with other iconic brands such as Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley Tea \u2013 confronts a litany of unprecedented challenges at a critical juncture of the carrier's ambitious turnaround.\nThe narrative was just beginning to change for Air India in the lead-up to the tragedy.\nIn the hands of a new private owner - the Tatas bought the airline from the government in 2022 \u2013 Air India showed an operating profit, better revenues and fewer customer complaints.\nAlthough disgruntlement about poor service standards, dysfunctional in-house entertainment and flight delays hadn't entirely gone away, there was an understanding that these were niggling transition troubles as the airline undertook multiple complex mergers to streamline its operations.\nCosmetically the improvements were beginning to show too; slick new livery and retrofitted interiors on some aircraft, brand-new A-350s in the fleet deployed on key routes and a record-breaking order for new planes to retire old ones and service India's booming aviation market.\nAfter years of neglect when Air India was under state ownership, the Tatas said earlier this year that they'd embarked on the \"final climb phrase\" of the carrier's transformation journey towards becoming a \"world class\" airline.\nLast week's horrific crash has now cast a shadow on these plans.\n\"I'll never fly Air India again\" was a common refrain heard among people gripped by panic and fear last week. While Air India, and particularly the Dreamliners it flew, have a strong safety record, this knee-jerk reaction was to be expected, say experts, when a crash on this scale happens. This loss of passenger confidence could derail the turnaround efforts that were already under way. \nA spate of other reported incidents this month \u2013 including engines developing suspected technical snags and a hoax bomb threat aboard a plane carrying 156 passengers from Phuket to Delhi \u2013 could worsen matters.\n\"There will definitely be a short-term impact where people may be wary of flying Air India. The disaster was very tragic, many lives have been lost and the event will stay in people's memories for long,\" said Jitendra Bhargava, a former executive director with the airline.\n\"We are already hearing of cancelled bookings,\" Shukor Yusof, founder and analyst at Malaysia-based Endau Analytics, told the BBC.\n\"Air India was a difficult flag carrier to turn around, to begin with, bogged down by legacy and financial issues. There will be a need to pause as they grapple with the aftermath of the tragedy and this [the turnaround] will likely take more time than management had envisaged.\"\nA lot of resources will now have to be redirected to non-operational issues dealing with the crash, such as insurance, legal and reputation damage in the coming weeks, months and even years, says Mr Yusof.\nDrawing parallels with the unprecedented twin tragedies that Malaysia Airlines suffered in 2014, he said it took a full decade for the airline to turn a profit after those crashes.\nAir India will require time to \"heal\" too, he said, whereas the advantage of the exceptional growth in air travel in India \"may now go to its rivals\".\nThe strain on operations is already beginning to show. Air India has said it is cancelling international services on its wide body aircraft by 15% until mid-July amid enhanced safety inspections and rising airspace restrictions.\nMeanwhile, the investigation - and what it potentially throws up - will continue to hang over the airline.\nWith authorities from the UK, US and India overseeing various safety inspections and regulatory aspects of the investigation, the airline will be under intense global scrutiny, according to Mark Martin, an aviation expert.\n\"Questions will be raised about operational and aircraft maintenance issues, and about what Air India has done to fix its old fleet,\" he said.\nThe most critical step after any crisis is the recovery action and consistent communication around it, says Mitu Samar Jha, whose firm offers risk and reputation advice to companies and corporate leaders in Mumbai. And Air India will need to make sure it doesn't get this wrong.\nIn a sense it is a triple whammy for the Tatas, who have the tough job of fielding questions on the fleet they inherited after acquiring Air India from the government, for Boeing's continuing troubles and their own maintenance and safety standards, she says.\n\"Investigations to identify the cause, corrective measures, and enhanced safety standards will follow soon but from the reputation lens, I hope they consistently communicate and that too authentically,\" says Ms Jha.\nOften, companies focus a lot on action post crisis but \"fail to regularly update the larger world on the progress. This results in the formation of incorrect perspectives and loss of control over the narrative, aggravating the reputation loss\", she adds.\nBut Air India hopes it can navigate this crisis from a position of strength.\nThe carrier's CEO Campbell Wilson has highlighted the airline's commitment to co-operating with investigators and supporting the families of the victims.\nEarlier this week, Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran held a town hall meeting with employees asking them to stay resolute amid any criticism, Reuters reported. He said last week's plane crash was the \"most heartbreaking\" crisis of his career and the airline should use it as a catalyst to build a safer airline.\nThe airline has some of the world's \"best pilots and engineers\" Sanjay Lazar, an aviation consultant told the BBC. Additionally, enhanced safety inspections ordered by India's regulator on all the carrier's 787 Dreamliners should be a morale booster for worried passengers.\n\"History indicates that post accidents and emergencies, airlines become ultra cautious, that is the human tendency. It's like a homeowner after a burglary, adds tons of locks. The airline will follow every comma and full stop in SOP [standard operating procedure],\" said Mr Lazar.\nThe Tatas may also take comfort from having Singapore Airlines (SIA) as a shareholder and partner - widely regarded as one of the world's best airlines. \nSIA could be instrumental in \"helping nurse Air India back to health\", said Mr Yusof.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Air India has said it is cancelling international services on its wide body aircraft by 15% until mid-July amid enhanced safety inspections and rising airspace restrictions.AFP via Getty ImagesThe crash means the turnaround will likely take more time than earlier envisaged, experts sayMeanwhile, the investigation - and what it potentially throws up - will continue to hang over the airline.With authorities from the UK, US and India overseeing various safety inspections and regulatory aspects of the investigation, the airline will be under intense global scrutiny, according to Mark Martin, an aviation expert. And Air India will need to make sure it doesn't get this wrong.In a sense it is a triple whammy for the Tatas, who have the tough job of fielding questions on the fleet they inherited after acquiring Air India from the government, for Boeing's continuing troubles and their own maintenance and safety standards, she says.",

        "article_text": "Investigators have made a chilling discovery in the preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash which killed 260 people in June.\nJust seconds after take-off, both of the 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner's fuel-control switches abruptly moved to the \"cut-off\" position, starving the engines of fuel and triggering total power loss. Switching to \"cut-off\" is a move typically done only after landing.\nThe cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\nThe switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power.\nAir India Flight 171 was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a crowded neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad, marking one of India's most baffling aviation disasters. \nInvestigators are probing the wreckage and cockpit recorders to understand what went wrong just after take-off. The Air India flight climbed to 625 feet in clear weather before losing location data about 50 seconds in, according to the FlightRadar24 website.\nThe preliminary report from the investigation - led by Indian authorities with experts from Boeing, General Electric, Air India, Indian regulators, and participants from the US and UK - raises several questions.\nInvestigators say the lever-lock fuel switches are designed to prevent accidental activation - they must be pulled up to unlock before flipping, a safety feature dating back to the 1950s. Built to exacting standards, they're highly reliable. Protective guard brackets further shield them from accidental bumps. \n\"It would be almost impossible to pull both switches with a single movement of one hand, and this makes accidental deployment unlikely,\" a Canada-based air accidents investigator, who wanted to remain unnamed, told the BBC.\nThat's what makes the Air India case stand out.\nIf one of the pilots was responsible for shutting down the switches, intentionally or not, it \"does beg the question: why\", said Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University.\n\"Was it intentional, or the result of confusion? That seems unlikely, as the pilots reported nothing unusual. \n\"In many cockpit emergencies, pilots may press the wrong buttons or make incorrect selections - but there was no indication of such a situation here, nor any discussion suggesting that the fuel switches were selected by mistake,\" he said.\n\"This kind of error doesn't typically happen without some evident issue.\"\nPeter Goelz, a former managing director of the US's NTSB, said: \"The finding is very disturbing - that a pilot has shut off the fuel switch within seconds of flying.\"\n\"There's likely much more on the cockpit voice recorder than what's been shared. A lone remark like 'why did you cut off the switches' isn't enough,\" he said.\n\"The new details suggest someone in the cockpit shut those valves. The question is, who, and why? Both switches were turned off and then restarted within seconds. \n\"The voice recorder will reveal more: was the flying pilot trying to restart the engines, or the monitoring one?\"\nInvestigators believe the cockpit voice recorder - with audio from pilot mics, radio calls and ambient cockpit sounds - holds the key to this puzzle.\n\"They haven't identified the voices yet, which is crucial. Typically, when the voice recorder is reviewed, people familiar with the pilots are present to help match voices. As of now, we still don't know which pilot turned the switches off and back on,\" said Mr Goelz.\nIn short, investigators say what's needed is clear voice identification, a full cockpit transcript with labelled speakers, and a thorough review of all communications from the moment the plane was pushed back from the gate to the time it crashed.\nThey also say this underscores the need for cockpit video recorders, as recommended by the NTSB. An over-the-shoulder view would show whose hand was on the cut-off switch. \nBefore boarding Flight 171, both pilots and crew had passed breathalyser tests and had been cleared fit to fly, the report says. The pilots, based in Mumbai, had arrived in Ahmedabad the day before the flight and had adequate rest.\nBut investigators are also zeroing in on what they describe is an interesting point in the report.\nIt says in December 2018, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) highlighting that some Boeing 737 fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.\nWhile the issue was noted, it wasn't deemed an unsafe condition requiring an Airworthiness Directive (AD) - a legally enforceable regulation to correct unsafe conditions in a product.\nThe same switch design is used in Boeing 787-8 aircraft, including Air India's VT-ANB which crashed. As the SAIB was advisory, Air India did not perform the recommended inspections. \nMr Pruchnicki said he's wondering whether there was a problem with the fuel control switches.\n\"What does this [bit in the report] exactly mean? Does it mean that with a single flip, that switch could shut the engine off and cut the fuel supply? When the locking feature is disengaged, what exactly happens? Could the switch just flip itself to off and shut down the engine? If that's the case, it's a really serious issue. If not, that also needs to be explained,\" he said.\nOthers, however, aren't convinced this is a key issue.\n\"I haven't heard of this which appears to be a low-profile FAA issuance. Nor have I heard any complaints [about the fuel switches] from pilots - who are usually quick to speak up. It's worth examining since it's mentioned, but it may just be a distraction,\" said Mr Goelz.\nCapt Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), wonders whether the switches tripped because of a problem with the plane's electronic control unit.\n\"Can the fuel cut-off switches be triggered electronically by the plane's electronic control unit without movement by the pilot? If the fuel cut-off switches tripped electronically, then it's a cause for concern,\" he told the BBC.\nThe report says fuel samples from the refuelling tanks were \"satisfactory\". Experts had earlier suggested fuel contamination as a possible cause of the dual engine failure. Notably, no advisory has been issued for the Boeing 787 or its GE GEnx-1B engines, with mechanical failure ruled out for now pending further investigation.\nIt also said that the aircraft's Ram Air Turbine (RAT) had deployed - a clear sign of a major systems failure - and the landing gear was found in \"down position\" or not retracted.\nThe RAT, a small propeller that extends from the underside of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, acts as an emergency backup generator. It automatically deploys in flight when both engines lose power or if all three hydraulic systems register critically low pressure, supplying limited power to keep essential flight systems operational.\n\"The deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) strongly supports the conclusion that both engines had failed,\" Mr Pruchnicki said.\nA Boeing 787 pilot explained why he thought the landing gear was not retracted.\n\"These days, every time I take off in a 787, I notice the landing gear retraction process closely. By the time the gear handle is pulled, we're already at about 200ft (60.9m), and the entire gear retraction process completes by around 400ft - roughly eight seconds in total, thanks to the aircraft's high-pressure hydraulic system.\" \nThe pilot believes the one flying had no time to think.\n\"When both engines fail and the aircraft starts going down, the reaction goes beyond just being startled - you go numb. In that moment, landing gear isn't your focus. Your mind is on one thing: the flight path. Where can I put this aircraft down safely? And in this case, there simply wasn't enough altitude to work with.\"\nInvestigators say the crew tried to recover, but it happened too fast.\n\"The engines were switched off and then back on. The pilots realised the engines were losing thrust - likely restarting the left one first, followed by the right,\" said Mr  Pruchnicki.\n\"But the right engine didn't have enough time to spool back up, and the thrust was insufficient. Both were eventually set to \"run\", but with the left shut down first and the right too late to recover, it was simply too little, too late.\"\nFamilies and friends of the crash victims had been anxiously awaiting the findings of the preliminary report.\nWhen the report was finally released early on Saturday in India, Imtiyaz Ali, who lost his brother, sister-in-law, and their two young children - read it carefully, only to be disappointed by what he said \"reads like a product description\".\n\"Other than the pilots' final conversation, there's nothing in it that really points to what caused the crash.\"\nHe said he hoped more details would be made public in the months to come.\n\"This matters to us. We want to know exactly what happened. It won't change anything for us now, we continue grieving - just as we have since that day. \n\"But at least we'll have some answers,\" Ali said.",

        "article_text": "Parents in several Indian cities, including capital Delhi, are protesting against what they call \"unsustainable\" fee raises by private schools. These increases, they say, are stretching household budgets to a breaking point and taking a toll on their children.\nAaditya Mattey, 14, woke up on 9 May feeling confident about his English exam.\nHis father dropped him off at his school in Indian capital Delhi, but Aaditya never got to write his exam.\n\"Two or three minutes after I entered the class, guards and bouncers asked me to leave the room,\" Aaditya recalls.\nHis father was still standing outside the school gates when Aaditya and a few other students were asked to get on the school bus, which dropped them off at their homes.\nAaditya's name was removed from Delhi Public School Dwarka's rolls after his father refused to pay a recent fee hike which he alleges was arbitrary and unauthorised.\nThe BBC reached out to DPS Dwarka and the Delhi Public School Society - which runs the DPS chain of schools - for comment, but did not receive a response.\nAaditya's case is not an isolated one and DPS is not the only school which is facing allegations of arbitrary fee increase.\nOver the past two months, protests have erupted across Indian cities - from Delhi to Pune to Hyderabad -  as a growing number of parents accuse private schools of imposing steep fee raises. \nIn Delhi, which has emerged as the epicentre of the protests, the issue recently made headlines after DPS Dwarka allegedly confined students in the library, hired security guards to stop them from entering classes and expelled them over unpaid dues. Parents have accused the school of punishing children for financial decisions made by their families.\nGovernment-run schools operate nationwide but often suffer from poor, inconsistent quality, prompting even many low-income families to choose private schools for better opportunities.\nIn Delhi, rules say that private schools on government-leased land must get Directorate of Education (DoE) approval before raising fees and must admit 25% economically weaker or disadvantaged students - a condition tied to their subsidised leases.\nThe BBC has contacted the DoE for comment on the fee rises, which parents have reported to us, but has not received a response.\nSchools, on the other hand, have argued in court and told parents that they are struggling. They cite inflation, rising staff salaries, delayed reimbursements from the government for economically weaker students and the need for infrastructure upgrades as reasons for raising fees.\nDivya Mattey says his son Aaditya's annual fee in 2020 was 93,400 rupees ($1,077; \u00a3802). This, he says, has more than doubled to 189,096 rupees in 2025-26.\nMr Mattey is among dozens of parents who have taken the school to court, alleging it has unlawfully removed students from rolls and harassed families over the fee issue.\n\"We never thought a school of this stature would treat children like this - bar them from classrooms, assign bouncers and make them sit in the library for days,\" he says.\nThe school did not answer the BBC's questions over email and on a phone call. But in court, it reportedly argued that there was no legal obligation to retain students whose fees haven't been paid. According to a report in The Indian Express newspaper, DPS claimed it suffered losses of 490m rupees last year and had to raise fees.\nA notice on the school's website meanwhile accuses \"a small group of parents\" of spreading \"false and malicious information regarding the school fee structure\" in an attempt to \"mislead and create confusion\".\nBut the controversy reflects a broader problem.\nA recent survey by online community platform LocalCircles found that more than 80% of parents with children in private schools said fees had increased by over 10% this academic year. In cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, the rise in some schools was as high as 30%.\nIndia has no centralised regulation for private schools; each state sets its own rules.\nFor example, Maharashtra allows a 15% fee rise every two years - subject to review if 25% of parents object - while Karnataka permits a 10% annual increase with audit justification. Enforcement, however, is weak, and legal disputes over fees often drag on for years, providing little timely relief to families.\nGagandeep Singh, whose son attends Mira Model School in West Delhi, says fees rose 45% last year and over 10% this year.\nSingh is willing to pay the earlier DoE-approved fee, but says the school has refused his cheque for the current term, which began nearly three months ago.\nThe BBC reached out to Mira Model School but received no response.\n\"It's not our job to regulate schools,\" Mr Singh says. \"That's what the government is supposed to do.\"\nMeanwhile, many parents fear that the DPS case has set a troubling precedent.\n\"We don't want our children to be thrown out of their classes, like what happened there,\" says Pankaj Gupta, whose son studies at Delhi's Maharaja Agarsain Public School.\nMr Gupta said the school increased fees by 25% this year without advance notice.\n\"We had no choice. We had to pay,\" he added.\nMr Gupta runs a small convenience store but has faced declining sales since the pandemic. The rise of online shopping has further squeezed physical stores. Now, rising school fees are pushing his family to the brink.\nThe BBC has reached out to Maharaja Agarsain Public School for comment.\nAnother parent, who wanted to remain anonymous, said she's considering withdrawing her son from the school he attended since childhood due to an \"unsustainable\" 30% fee hike this year.\n\"Both my husband and I work, but our salaries haven't gone up significantly. As a parent, you try to give your child the best but sometimes that comes at great personal cost,\" she said.\nBut she admits that switching schools also feels risky - what if the next one also increases fees?\n\"It's the same situation everywhere,\" she said.\nThe uproar has prompted the Delhi government to act.\nOn 10 June the state cabinet approved the Delhi School Education (Transparency in Fixation and Regulation of Fees) Ordinance, 2025, pending the Lieutenant Governor's approval - necessary for it to become a law.\nThough not yet public, Education Minister Ashish Sood says it will tighten private school fee regulations.\nBut parents are demanding greater transparency. Last weekend, hundreds protested in Delhi, urging the government to consider their feedback when drafting the bill.\nShikha Sharma Bagga, Supreme Court lawyer and secretary of a group called Justice for All, urges timely audits: \"Schools' finances must be audited before each academic year so parents know what they're paying for.\"\nBack in Dwarka, Aaditya is still trying to get back to class.\nMedia reports say DPS Dwarka has agreed to reinstate students expelled for not paying fees. But Mr Mattey says they are still waiting.\n\"The school has shown some reciprocation, but to this date my child's name is not back on the register,\" he says, adding that he hasn't received any assignments for the current academic session.\n\"My son is only 14. He should be focusing on his studies, not worrying about whether he'll be allowed to sit in class tomorrow.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "After years of border tensions, India and China appear to be gradually moving towards resetting ties - but larger challenges and suspicions remain.\nThe visit of two senior Indian officials to China late last month was seen as a sign of a thaw in bilateral relations.\nIn June, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also made separate visits as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings. \nThe SCO is a 10-member Eurasian security grouping that also includes China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. Singh's visit was the first by a senior Indian official to China in five years.\nAt the heart of India-China tensions is an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long disputed border. Rivers, lakes and snow-caps along the frontier mean the line often shifts, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes sparking skirmishes. \nThe crisis escalated in June 2020 when the two forces clashed in the Galwan valley in Ladakh in what was the first fatal confrontation between them since 1975. At least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. Stand-offs between the militaries have since taken place in several places.\nBut geopolitical uncertainty and ground realities appear to have nudged the two sides to find common ground on several issues. \nLate last year, they reached an agreement on the main friction points in Ladakh. \nIn January, Delhi and Beijing agreed to restore direct flights and relax visa curbs that were imposed after the 2020 clash. \nThe same month, Indian pilgrims were allowed to visit a sacred mountain, the Kailash, and a holy lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region after a gap of six years.\nBut experts point out there are other hurdles. \nFor India, China is the second-largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching more than $127bn (\u00a393.4bn) last year. It relies heavily on Chinese imports, particularly rare earth minerals. \nPeace in border areas, therefore, is essential to boost economic ties. \nWith its increasing focus on Taiwan, Beijing also wants peace in its Himalayan border with India - for now. \nBut at a strategic level, China suspects that Western nations are using India to counterbalance its rise and growing influence. \nSo, in addition to solving the border dispute, Beijing would want improvements in other areas as well, as it hopes to counter Delh's increasing dependence on the US and its allies for security. \nThis includes more Chinese exports; increasing investments in India, and the removal of visa restrictions for Chinese engineers and workers. (India had banned dozens of Chinese apps and imposed restrictions on Chinese investments in the aftermath of the 2020 clash, citing security concerns). \nFast-changing geopolitics - particularly in the US since President Trump assumed a second term in power - has also compelled Delhi to reach out to China, experts say. \n\"India thought it would be a very close strategic ally [of the US] but they were not getting the support they were expecting from Washington,\" Professor Christopher Clary of University of Albany in New York tells the BBC.\nDuring recent border tensions with arch-rival Pakistan in May, Delhi also witnessed the growing military co-operation between Beijing and Islamabad. Pakistan used Chinese made fighter jets, air defence systems and air-to-air missiles in the four-day conflict.\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, Trump repeatedly asserted that he had mediated between the two sides for a ceasefire.\nThis embarrassed Delhi which insists that it directly spoke with Pakistani officials to stop the fighting, and vehemently denies any third-party mediation.\nWeeks later, Trump also hosted Pakistani army chief Asim Munir for lunch at the White House, much to the dismay of Delhi. \nAt the same time, the US and India are also engaged in frantic talks to reach a trade agreement. Trump has already threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, if a deal is not reached by 1 August .\n\"Given President Trump's statements about the mediation between India and Pakistan and about the trade talks, there's a feeling in Delhi that this is the time to reach out to countries like China,\" Clary says.\nStrategic experts argue that Washington views Delhi as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But given the US president's unpredictability, there are now doubts in Delhi about how far the US will go to support India in any future conflict with China.\nThe Quadrilateral Security Dialogue \u2013 known as the Quad \u2013 involving the US, Japan, Australia and India has taken a back seat during the Trump administration's second term. \n\"In recent years, China has also significantly increased its influence in other multilateral organisations like the SCO and the Brics grouping of emerging economies,\" says Phunchok Stobdan, a former senior Indian diplomat.\nSo, India is taking a pragmatic approach, he says. \n\"At the same time, it does not want to be seen yielding too much to the Chinese demands for domestic reasons,\" he adds. \nAnd it's not just the US - India is also keenly watching how its long-time ally and major weapons supplier Russia leaned towards Beijing due to the war with Ukraine.\nWestern sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased Moscow's reliance on China for energy exports. \nMoscow also depends on Beijing for critical imports and investments, all of which has made Delhi wary of the Kremlin's position in any future confrontation with China. \nChina is also using its industrial might to squeeze many nations that depend on its imports - and countries like India feel the restrictions might impact their economic growth.\n\"China has lately been utilising trade as a weapon against India, suspending crucial exports such as rare earth magnets and fertilisers. These actions could affect India's manufacturing and agricultural sectors,\" Mr Stobdan says.\nRare earth magnets are especially crucial for automobile, home appliance and clean energy sectors. China imposed restrictions on its imports starting from April, requiring companies to obtain permits. \nAn Indian automobile industry association has warned that production could be severely impacted if the restrictions are not eased soon. Following these apprehensions, the Indian government said it was holding talks with Beijing.\nThough China is keen on boosting business, it hasn't shown any signs of compromise on its other territorial disputes with India.\nIn recent years, it has increasingly asserted its claim over the entire north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Southern Tibet.\nDelhi asserts that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country and points out that people of the state regularly vote in elections to choose their state government and there's no room for any compromise.\n\"If China and India would not abandon the concept of sovereignty, then they will continue to fight forever. If they can reach a deal on Southern Tibet [or Arunachal Pradesh], then the two countries would have eternal peace,\" Prof Shen Dingli from the Fudan University in Shanghai tells the BBC.\nFor now, both Delhi and Beijing are aware that their territorial dispute cannot be solved in the near future.\nThey seem willing to strike a working relationship that's mutually beneficial, and would want to avoid tensions altogether, rather than relying on any global power bloc for support.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) from the crashed Air India flight, a key step in uncovering what caused last week's deadly accident.\nThe London-bound Air India aircraft, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, crashed soon after taking off on Thursday from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad. At least 270 people have been killed, most of them passengers.\nThe CVR captures audio from the cockpit, including pilot conversations, alarms and ambient sounds.\nThe flight data recorder (FDR), which logs crucial flight parameters like altitude, speed and engine performance, had been recovered from the debris on Friday.\nBoth the CVR and FDR collectively form what is commonly known as the \"black box\" of a plane. It is a vital tool in air crash investigations, helping experts reconstruct the flight's final moments and determine the cause of the incident.\nThe black box, unlike the name suggests, is actually two bright orange devices - one for the CVR and the other for the FDR - painted with reflective strips for easier recovery after a crash. Both these devices are designed to survive a crash.\nIndia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and the UK. \nOn Sunday, officials from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) surveyed the site of the plane crash.\n\"The AAIB has launched a detailed investigation, and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols, since the aircraft is American-made,\" a statement released  on Sunday said.\nIndian media outlets have reported, citing sources, that officials from Boeing and  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) - the US aviation safety agency - also visited the site.\nSeparately, a high-level committee set up by the Indian government to examine the reasons behind the crash is expected to hold its first meeting on Monday.\nThe committee will submit a preliminary report within three months, the All India Radio said, and will propose new standard operating procedures (SOPs) to help prevent similar incidents in future.\nAs the investigation continues, families on the ground are still grappling with disbelief and trauma.\nLess than a minute after taking off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, the AI171 flight crashed into a doctors' accommodation building at the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital. \nAll but one of the 242 passengers and crew members were killed.

He added that 47 of the identified bodies have been sent to their families.\nAmong the identified victims is Vijay Rupani, the former chief minister of Gujarat, whose funeral will be held on Monday. Rupani, whose political career spanned more than 50 years, will be laid to rest with full state honours in Rajkot city.\nFor many other families, the agonising wait continues.  \nOfficials told the BBC that the identification process has been slow and painstaking, as many of the bodies were badly burned in the crash and are being processed in small batches.\nMistry Jignesh, waiting outside the hospital for updates on his niece, told the BBC on Saturday that officials told him that it might take longer for them to hand over his niece's remains as the search for bodies is still ongoing.

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture.

        "article_text": "It was a killing that shocked India: Punjabi hip-hop star Sidhu Moose Wala shot dead through the windscreen of his car by hired gunmen.\nWithin hours, a Punjabi gangster named Goldy Brar had used Facebook to claim responsibility for ordering the hit.\nBut three years after the murder, no-one has faced trial - and Goldy Brar is still on the run, his whereabouts unknown.\nNow, BBC Eye has managed to make contact with Brar and challenged him about how and why Sidhu Moose Wala became a target.\nHis response was coldly articulate.\n\"In his arrogance, he [Moose Wala] made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,\"  Brar told the BBC World Service.\n\"We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that.\"\nOn a warm May evening in 2022, Sidhu Moose Wala was taking his black Mahindra Thar SUV for its usual spin through dusty lanes near his village in the northern Indian state of Punjab when, within minutes, two cars began tailing him.\nCCTV footage later showed them weaving through narrow turns, sticking close. Then, at a bend in the road, one of the vehicles lurched forward, cornering Moose Wala's SUV against a wall. He was trapped. Moments later, the shooting began.\nMobile footage captured the aftermath. His SUV was riddled with bullets, the windscreen shattered, the bonnet punctured.\nIn trembling voices, bystanders expressed their shock and concern.\n\"Someone get him out of the car.\"\n\"Get some water.\"\n\"Moose Wala has been shot.\"\nBut it was too late. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital - hit by 24 bullets, a post-mortem would later reveal. The 28-year-old rapper, one of modern-day Punjab's biggest cultural icons, had been gunned down in broad daylight.\nOutside the UK, watch on YouTube, or listen on BBC.com\nA cousin and a friend who had been in the car with Moose Wala at the time of the ambush were injured, but survived.\nSix gunmen were eventually identified. They carried AK-47s and pistols. In the weeks that followed the murder, about 30 people were arrested and two of the suspected armed men were killed in what the Indian police described as \"encounters\".\nYet even with arrests piling up, the motive remained murky.\nGoldy Brar, who claims to have ordered the hit, wasn't in India at the time of the killing. He is believed to have been in Canada.\nOur conversation with him unfolded over six hours, pieced together through an exchange of voice notes. It gave us a chance to find out why Moose Wala had been killed and to interrogate the motives of the man who claimed responsibility.\nSidhu Moose Wala was born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu in a Jat-Sikh family in rural Punjab, before moving in 2016 to Canada to study engineering - a journey familiar to hundreds of thousands in the Punjabi diaspora.\nBut it was there, far from his village of Moosa - the inspiration for his rap name - that he reinvented himself as one of Punjabi music's most influential artists. In just five years, Moose Wala became the unmistakable voice of Punjabi hip-hop.\nWith his signature swagger, flashy style, and lyrical grit, Moose Wala sang openly about identity and politics, guns and revenge, pushing the boundaries of what Punjabi music had been willing to say.\nHe was fascinated by rapper Tupac Shakur, who had been murdered, aged 25, in 1996. \"In terms of personality, I want to be like him,\" Moose Wala once told an interviewer. \"The day he died, people cried for him. I want the same. When I die, people should remember that I was someone.\"\nOver a brief but explosive career, the singer spotlighted the darker undercurrents of India's Punjab region - gangster culture, unemployment, and political decay - while evoking a deep nostalgia for village life.\nMoose Wala was also a global force. With more than five billion views of his music videos on YouTube, a Top 5 spot in the UK charts, and collaborations with international hip-hop artists including Burna Boy, Moose Wala swiftly built a fan base stretching across India, Canada, the UK and beyond, powered by a diaspora that saw him as both icon and insurgent.\nBut fame came at a cost. Despite his rising star and socially conscious lyrics, Moose Wala was drifting into dangerous territory. His defiant attitude, visibility, and growing influence had drawn the attention of Punjab's most feared gangsters. These included Goldy Brar, and Brar's friend Lawrence Bishnoi, who even then was in a high-security jail in India.\nNot much is known about Brar, apart from the fact he is on the Interpol Red Notice list, and is a key operative in a network of gangsters operated by Bishnoi \u2013 orchestrating hits, issuing threats and amplifying the gang's reach. It is thought he emigrated to Canada in 2017, just a year after Moose Wala himself, and initially worked as a truck driver.\nBishnoi, once a student leader steeped in Punjab's violent campus politics, has grown into one of India's most feared criminal masterminds.\n\"The first [police] cases filed against Lawrence Bishnoi were all related to student politics and student elections\u2026 beating a rival student leader, kidnapping him, harming him,\" according to Jupinderjit Singh, deputy editor of Indian newspaper the Tribune.\nThis led to a spell in jail which hardened him further, says Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, Assistant Inspector General of the Anti-Gangster Task Force of Punjab Police.\n\"Once he was in jail, he started to get deeper into crime. Then he formed a group of his own. When it became an inter-gang thing, he needed money for survival. They need more manpower, they need more weapons. They need money for all that. So, for money, you have to get into extortion or crime.\"\nNow 31, Bishnoi runs his syndicate from behind bars - with dedicated Instagram pages and a cult-like following.\n\"So while Bishnoi sits in jail, Brar handles the gangs,\" says Assistant Inspector General Chauhan.\nSecuring BBC Eye's exchange with Brar took a year of chasing - cultivating sources, waiting for replies, gradually getting closer to the kingpin himself. But when we got through to Brar, the conversation cast new light on the question of how and why he and Bishnoi came to see Moose Wala as an enemy.\nOne of the first revelations was that Bishnoi's relationship with Moose Wala went back several years, long before the singer's killing.\n\"Lawrence [Bishnoi] was in touch with Sidhu [Moose Wala]. I don't know who introduced them, and I never asked. But they did speak,\" said Brar.\n\"Sidhu used to send 'good morning' and 'good night' messages in an effort to flatter Lawrence.\"\nA friend of Moose Wala's, who spoke anonymously, also told us that Bishnoi had been in touch with Moose Wala as early as 2018, calling him from jail and telling him he liked his music.\nBrar told us that the \"first dispute\" between them came after Moose Wala had moved back to India. It began with a seemingly innocuous match of kabbadi - a traditional South Asian contact team sport - in a Punjabi village.\nMoose Wala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang - Brar told us, in a sport where match-fixing and gangster influence are rampant.\n\"That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\nYet the dispute between Moose Wala and Bishnoi was eventually resolved by an associate of Bishnoi's called Vicky Middhukhera.\nBut when Middukhera himself was gunned down by gangsters in a parking lot in Mohali in August 2021, Brar told us Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moose Wala reached the point of no return.\nThe Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moose Wala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moose Wala denied any involvement.\nThe Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moose Wala to the killing or to any gang-related crime. But Moose Wala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang - a perception that may have cost him his life.\nAlthough he can cite no proof of Moose Wala's involvement, Brar remains convinced that the singer was somehow complicit in the killing of Middukhera. Brar repeatedly told us that Shaganpreet Singh had assisted the gunmen in the days before Middukhera's shooting - and inferred that Moose Wala himself must have been involved.\n\"Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\n\"We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea.\n\"So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard.\"\nWe put it to Brar that India has a judicial system and the rule of law - how could he justify taking the law into his own hands?\n\"Law. Justice. There's no such thing,\" he says. \"Only the powerful can... [obtain] justice, not ordinary people like us.\"\nHe went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system.\n\"He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going.\"\nHe appeared unrepentant.\n\"I did what I had to do for my brother. \u202fI have no remorse whatsoever.\"\nThe killing of Moose Wala has not just resulted in the loss of a major musical talent, it has also emboldened Punjab's gangsters.\nBefore the singer's murder, few outside Punjab had heard of Bishnoi or Brar.\nAfter the killing, their names were everywhere. They hijacked Moose Wala's fame and converted it into their own brand of notoriety - a notoriety that became a powerful tool for extortion.\n\"This is the biggest killing that has happened in the last few decades in Punjab,\" says Ritesh Lakhi, a Punjab-based journalist. \"The capacity of gangsters to extort money has gone up. [Goldy Brar]'s getting huge sums of money after killing Moose Wala.\"\nJournalist Jupinderjit Singh agrees: \"The fear factor around gangsters has risen amongst the public.\" \nExtortion has long been a problem in the Punjabi music industry, but now after Sidhu's murder, Singh says: \"It's not just people in the music and film industry who are being extorted - even local businessmen are receiving calls.\"\nWhen BBC Eye quizzed Brar on this, he denied this was the motive, but did admit - in stark terms - that extortion was central to the gang's working.\n\"To feed a family of four a man has to struggle all his life. We have to look after hundreds or even thousands of people who are like family to us. We have to extort people.\n\"To get money,\" he says, \"we have to be feared.\"",

        "article_text": "For weeks, a battle over language and identity has been raging in India's richest state, Maharashtra.\nThe row began in April after the Maharashtra government made it compulsory for state-run primary schools to teach Hindi as a third language, apart from English and Marathi (the state's dominant language). This, it said, was in line with a federal policy which mandates that children be taught three languages in school.\nThe National Education Policy (NEP), introduced in 1968, aims to promote and regulate education in India and the government updates it occasionally. The latest iteration of the policy, introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government five years ago, is being implemented in stages and has run into controversy earlier. \nThe Maharashtra government's decision met fierce opposition from civil society groups, language activists and opposition leaders who accused it of trying to impose Hindi - predominantly spoken in northern and central Indian states - in the state.\nLanguage is a sensitive issue in India where many states, including Maharashtra, were formed on linguistic lines after independence. The local language is often intrinsically linked to regional pride and identity, and any change to the status quo can be perceived as a threat. For instance, last year, Kannada-language activists in Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley, held protests demanding that billboards be written in the local language and not just English.\nBut the uneasiness is especially high when it comes to Hindi, the most-spoken language in India. Over the years, steps by various federal governments to promote Hindi have fuelled fears within non-Hindi speaking states that the local culture will be diluted. These worries have been exacerbated by high migration from less-developed Hindi-speaking states to other parts of India, especially the south, in search of jobs.\nAbhay Deshpande, a political analyst, says that these anxieties have increased after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. Top leaders of the BJP - the party is stronger in Hindi-speaking states - have often courted controversy by making remarks about privileging Hindi.\nAs tensions rose in Maharashtra, the state government - ruled by a BJP-led coalition - revoked its decision and appointed a committee to re-examine the three-language policy. But the controversy refuses to die down.\nThe row comes months ahead of the long-overdue municipal polls which are set to be held in the state, including in Mumbai city, home to India's richest municipal corporation. It has sparked a political slugfest between the ruling coalition and opposition parties, with each side accusing the other of playing political games. \nThere have also been reports of violence against non-Marathi speakers in the state.\nIn April, two women in Thane district were allegedly assaulted in their residential complex after they said \"excuse me\" to a man who insisted they speak to him in Marathi.\nThe same month, a security guard in Mumbai was allegedly beaten up by workers from the opposition Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) - a nativist party known for its aggressive brand of politics - after he said that he did not know Marathi.\nIn May, a couple in Mumbai reportedly refused to pay a delivery agent after he declined to speak in Marathi. Last week, a shocking video showing a shop owner being assaulted, allegedly by MNS workers, for not speaking Marathi went viral on social media, sparking outrage.\nWhile the issue seems to have increased societal divisions, it has also brought together two political rivals almost two decades after they parted ways.\nLast week, Uddhav Thackeray, chief of the local opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party and Raj Thackeray, leader of the MNS - the son and nephew, respectively, of Bal Thackeray, patriarch of the erstwhile Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party that gained popularity in Maharashtra in the 1960s with its nativist politics - held a joint rally to oppose alleged Hindi imposition.\nWhile the strength of the truce remains to be seen, experts say that the optics of the cousins putting aside differences to \"protect Marathi pride\" could help their prospects in the upcoming municipal elections.\n\"The issue of Marathi language and culture is close to peoples' hearts,\" says Prashant Dixit, a former political journalist who has reported on the state for over two decades. \"It is an emotive issue, especially for people living in Mumbai, and it has been so since the 1960s,\" he adds.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the erstwhile Shiv Sena, under the leadership of Bal Thackeray, conducted aggressive campaigns against people who had migrated to Mumbai from southern states, accusing them of taking up jobs that should have gone to locals.\nIn the decades after that, migration patterns changed and the party turned its ire towards people from northern states who were migrating to the city in search of economic opportunities. The party blamed migrants from states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for taking away jobs. \nThese tensions look set to continue. According to data from India's last census, there was a 40% increase in Mumbai city's Hindi-speaking population between 2001 and 2011.\nThese Marathi-centric agitations have earlier resonated with voters, especially in Mumbai, and some believe that it could help the Thackeray cousins in the municipal elections as well.  \nHowever, many have criticised this approach.\nAn editorial in the Indian Express newspaper titled 'Slap In Mumbai's Face' argued that politics centred around linguistic identity was \"deeply troubling\" and that its parochialism lent itself to violence, something that \"should have no place in India's most industrialised state\". \nMr Dixit agrees - he thinks that any support garnered by aggressive language agitations is likely to be short-lived. \n\"People want their leaders to deliver on their promises and focus on real progress, in the form of better jobs and policies, so that life is better for everyone,\" he says.",

        "article_text": "At midnight on 25 June 1975, India - a young democracy and the world's largest - froze.\nThen prime minister Indira Gandhi had just declared a nationwide Emergency. Civil liberties were suspended, opposition leaders jailed, the press gagged, and the constitution turned into a tool of absolute executive power. For the next 21 months, India was technically still a democracy but functioned like anything but.\nThe trigger? A bombshell verdict by the Allahabad High Court had found Gandhi guilty of electoral malpractice and invalidated her 1971 election win. Facing political disqualification and a rising wave of street protests led by veteran socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan, Gandhi chose to declare an \"internal emergency\" under Article 352 of the constitution, citing threats to national stability.\nAs historian Srinath Raghavan notes in his new book on Indira Gandhi, the constitution did allow wide-ranging powers during an Emergency. But what followed was \"extraordinary and unprecedented strengthening of executive power... untrammelled by judicial scrutiny\".\nOver 110,000 people were arrested, including major opposition political figures such as Morarji Desai, Jyoti Basu and LK Advani. Bans were slapped on groups from the right-wing to the far-left. Prisons were overcrowded and torture was routine.\nThe courts, stripped of independence, offered little resistance. In Uttar Pradesh, which jailed the highest number of detainees, not a single detention order was overturned. \"No citizen could move the courts for enforcement of their fundamental rights,\" writes Raghavan.\nDuring a controversial family planning campaign, an estimated 11 million Indians were sterilised - many by coercion. Though officially state-run, the programme was widely believed to be orchestrated by Sanjay Gandhi, the unelected son of Indira Gandhi. Many believe a shadowy second government, led by Sanjay, wielded unchecked power behind the scenes.\nThe poor were hit hardest. Cash incentives for surgery often equalled a month's income or more. In one Delhi neighbourhood near the Uttar Pradesh border -  derisively dubbed \"Castration Colony\" (places where forced sterilisation programmes took place) - women reportedly said they'd been made bewas (widows) by the state as \"our men are no longer men\". Police in Uttar Pradesh alone recorded over 240 violent incidents tied to the programme.\nIn their book on Delhi under Emergency, civil-rights activist John Dayal and journalist Ajoy Bose wrote that officials were under intense pressure to meet sterilisation quotas. Junior officers enforced the order ruthlessly - contract labourers were told, \"No advances, no jobs, unless you get vasectomies.\" \nParallel to this, a massive urban \"clean-up\" demolished nearly 120,000 slums, displacing some 700,000 people in Delhi alone, as part of a gentrification campaign described by critics as social cleansing. These people were dumped into new \"resettlement colonies\" far away from their workplaces. \nOne of the worst episodes of slum demolitions occurred in Delhi's Turkman Gate, a Muslim-majority neighbourhood, where police fired on protesters resisting demolition, killing at least six and displacing thousands.\nThe press was silenced overnight. On the eve of the Emergency, power to newspaper presses in Delhi was cut. By morning, censorship was law. \nWhen The Indian Express newspaper finally published its 28 June edition - delayed by a power outage - it left a blank space where its editorial should have been. The Statesman followed suit, printing blank columns to signal censorship. Even The National Herald, founded by India's first prime minister and Indira Gandhi's father Jawaharlal Nehru, quietly dropped its masthead slogan: \"Freedom is in peril, defend it with all your might.\" Shankar's Weekly, a satirical magazine known for its cartoons, shut down entirely.\nIn her book - a personal history of the Emergency - journalist Coomi Kapoor reveals the extent of media censorship through detailed examples of blackout orders. \nThese included bans on reporting or photographing slum demolitions in Delhi, conditions in a maximum-security Tihar Jail, and developments in opposition-ruled states like Tamil Nadu. Coverage of the family planning drive was tightly controlled - no \"adverse comments or editorials\" were permitted. Even stories deemed trivial or embarrassing were scrubbed: no \"sensational\" reporting on a notorious bandit and no mention of a Bollywood actress caught shoplifting in London.\nKapoor also notes that BBC's Mark Tully, along with journalists from The Times, Newsweek and The Daily Telegraph, were given 24 hours to leave India for refusing to sign a \"censorship agreement\". (Years after the Emergency, when Gandhi was back in power, Tully introduced her to the BBC's chief. He asked how it felt to lose public support. She smiled and said, \"I never lost the support of the people, only the people were misled by rumours, many of which were spread by the BBC.\")\nSome judges pushed back. The Bombay and Gujarat high courts warned that censorship couldn't be used to \"brainwash the public\". But that resistance was quickly drowned out. \nThat wasn't all. In July 1976, Sanjay Gandhi pushed the Youth Congress - the governing Congress party's youth wing - to adopt his personal five-point programme, including family planning, tree plantation, refusal of dowry, promotion of adult literacy and abolition of caste. \nCongress president DK Barooah instructed all state and local committees to implement Sanjay's five points alongside the government's official 20-point programme, effectively merging state policy with Sanjay's personal crusade.\nAnthropologist Emma Tarlo, author of a richly detailed ethnographic work of the period, wrote that during the Emergency, the poor were subjected to \"forced choices\". It was also a turning point for industrial relations. \n\"The last vestiges of working-class politics were imperiously wiped out,\" wrote Christophe Jaffrelot and Pratinav Anil in their book on the period they call \"India's first dictatorship\".  Around 2,000 trade union leaders and members were jailed, strikes were banned and worker benefits were slashed. \nThe number of man-days lost to stoppages plunged - from 33.6 million in 1974 to just 2.8 million in 1976. Strikers dropped from 2.7 million to half a million. The government also loosened its grip on the private sector, helping the economy rebound after years of stagnation. Industrialist JRD Tata praised the regime's \"refreshingly pragmatic and result-oriented approach\".\nDespite its heavy-handedness, the Emergency was seen by some as a period of order and efficiency. Inder Malhotra, a journalist, wrote that in \"its initial months at least, the Emergency restored to India a kind of calm it had not known for years\".\nTrains ran on time, strikes vanished, production rose, crime fell, and prices dropped after a good 1975 monsoon - bringing much-needed stability. \"One fact is conclusive proof of the quiescence of the middle class - that hardly any officials resigned in protest against the Emergency,\" writes historian Ramachandra Guha in his book India After Gandhi. \nScholars believe the Emergency's harshest measures were largely confined to northern India because southern states had stronger regional parties and more resilient civil societies that limited central overreach. Gandhi's Congress party, which ruled federally, had weaker control in the south, giving regional leaders greater autonomy to resist or moderate draconian policies. \nThe Emergency formally ended in March 1977 after Gandhi called elections - and lost. The new Janata government - a rag-tag coalition of parties - rolled back many of the laws she'd passed. But the deeper damage was done. As many historians have written, the Emergency revealed how easily democratic structures could be hollowed out from within - even legally.\n\"It is no wonder that the Emergency is remembered emotively in India... Indira's suspension of constitutional rights appears as an abrupt disavowal of the liberal-democratic spirit that animated Nehru and other nationalist leaders who founded India as a constitutional republic in 1950,\" historian Gyan Prakash wrote in his book on the Emergency.\nToday, the Emergency is remembered in India as a brief authoritarian interlude - an aberration. But that framing, warns Prakash, breeds \"a smug confidence in the present\". \n\"It tells us that the past is really past, it is over, it is history. The present is free from its burdens. India's democracy, we are told, heroically recovered from Indira's brief misadventure with no lasting damage and with no enduring, unaddressed problems in its functioning,\" Prakash writes.\n\"Underlying it is an impoverished conception of democracy, one that regards it only in terms of certain forms and procedures.\"\nIn other words, this perception ignores how fragile democracy can be when institutions fail to hold power to account. \nThe Emergency was also a stark warning against the perils of hero worship - something embodied in the towering political persona of Indira Gandhi. \nBack in 1949, BR Ambedkar, architect of the constitution, cautioned Indians against surrendering their freedoms to a \"great leader\".\nBhakti (devotion), he said, was acceptable in religion - but in politics, it was \"a sure road to degradation and eventual dictatorship\".",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A state-of-the-art British fighter jet stuck at an airport in India for nearly three weeks now has sparked curiosity and raised questions about how such a modern aircraft could get stranded for days in a foreign country.\nThe F-35B landed at Thiruvananthapuram airport in the southern state of Kerala on 14 June.\nThe aircraft was diverted there after it ran into bad weather during a sortie in the Indian ocean and was unable to return to HMS Prince of Wales, the Royal Navy's flagship carrier.\nIt landed safely but it has since developed a technical snag and is unable to return to the carrier.\nSince the jet's landing, engineers from HMS Prince of Wales have assessed the aircraft, but the visiting teams have been unable to fix it so far.\nOn Thursday, the British High Commission said in a statement to the BBC: \"The UK has accepted an offer to move the aircraft to the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul facility at the airport. It will be moved to the hangar once UK engineering teams arrive with specialist equipment, thereby ensuring there is minimal disruption to scheduled maintenance of other aircraft.\n\"The aircraft will return to active service once repairs and safety checks have been completed,\" it added. \"Ground teams continue to work closely with Indian authorities to ensure safety and security precautions are observed.\" \nAuthorities at Thiruvananthapuram airport told the BBC they were expecting technicians from the UK to arrive on Saturday.\nThe $110m (\u00a380m) jet is being guarded around the clock by six officers from the RAF.\nDr Sameer Patil, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai, told the BBC the Royal Navy had only two options: \"They can repair it and make it fly-worthy or they can fly it out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.\"\nThe case of the stranded jet has also been raised in the House of Commons. \nOn Monday, opposition Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty asked the government to clarify what was being done to secure it and return it to operational service, the UK Defence Journal reported. \n\"What steps are the government taking to recover the plane, how much longer will that take, and how will the government ensure the security of protected technologies on the jet while it is in the hangar and out of view?\" he was quoted as saying.\nThe British armed forces minister, Luke Pollard, confirmed the aircraft remained under close UK control.\n\"We continue to work with our Indian friends who provided first-class support when the F-35B was unable to return to the carrier,\" he said. \"I am certain that the security of the jet is in good hands because Royal Air Force crew are with it at all times.\"\nF-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability. \nSo images of the \"lonely F-35B\", parked on the tarmac and soaked by the Kerala monsoon rains, have spawned memes on social media.\nOne viral post joked that the jet had been put up for sale at an online site at a hugely competitive price of $4m. The listing claimed the jet included features like \"automatic parking, brand-new tyres, a new battery and an automatic gun to destroy traffic violators\".\nOne user on X said the jet deserved Indian citizenship as it had been in the country long enough, while another suggested that India should start charging rent and that the Kohinoor diamond would be the most appropriate payment.\nOn Wednesday, Kerala government's tourism department also joined in the fun with a post on X that said \"Kerala, the destination you'll never want to leave.\"\nThe post included an AI-generated photograph of an F-35B standing on the runway with coconut palm trees in the background. The text suggested that, like most visitors to the state described in tourism brochures as \"God's own country\" for its scenic beauty, the jet too was finding it hard to leave.\nDr Patil says that each passing day that the jet remains stranded, \"it adversely affects the image of the F-35Bs and the Royal Navy\".\n\"The jokes and memes and rumours and conspiracy theories are affecting the image and credibility of the British Royal Navy. The longer the jet stays stranded, the more disinformation will come out.\" \nThe engineering issues \"seem of a much more serious nature\" than it was originally thought, he says.\nBut most militaries, he adds, prepare for \"a worst-case scenario\" - and it is one since a jet is stranded on foreign soil. \n\"Most militaries would have a standard operating procedure [SOP] on how to respond when something like this happens. So does the Royal Navy not have an SOP?\"\nThe optics of this, he says, are really bad. \n\"If such a thing had happened in enemy territory, would they have taken this much time? This makes for very bad PR for a professional navy.\"\nAdditional reporting by Ashraf Padanna in Thiruvananthapuram",

        "article_text": "Less than 40 seconds.\nThat's how long Air India Flight 171 was airborne before it plunged into a densely populated neighbourhood in Ahmedabad in one of India's most baffling aviation disasters in recent memory.\nInvestigators now face the grim task of sifting through the wreckage and decoding the cockpit voice and flight data recorders of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to piece together what went catastrophically wrong in the seconds after take-off. Under international rules set by the UN aviation body ICAO, a preliminary investigation report should be released within 30 days, with the final report ideally completed within 12 months.\nThe London Gatwick-bound aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar, lifted off from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT) on Thursday, with 242 people and nearly 100 tonnes of fuel on board. Within moments, a mayday call crackled from the cockpit. It would be the last transmission. This was followed by a loss of altitude and a crash engulfed in flames.\nCaptain Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), calls this \"the rarest of the rare\" crashes - a controlled flight into terrain just 30 seconds after take-off. \"To my knowledge, nothing quite like this has ever happened,\" he told the BBC.\nDid both engines fail due to bird strikes or fuel contamination? Were the flaps improperly extended, reducing lift on a heavily loaded jet in extreme heat? Was there a maintenance error during engine servicing? Or did an inadvertent crew action cut off fuel to both engines?\nInvestigators will be probing all these possibilities - and more. Air crash investigations rely on triangulation and elimination - matching physical evidence from the wreckage with recorded aircraft performance data to build a coherent picture of what went wrong.\nEvery scorched cable, damaged turbine blade, aeroplane maintenance log, and signals and sounds from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders - the so-called \"black box\" - will be examined. The BBC spoke to accident experts to understand how the investigation will proceed.\nCritically, the first clues on the ground may come from the wreckage of the two engines, at least three investigators said.\n\"You can tell from the damage whether the engines were generating power at impact - turbines fracture differently when spinning at high speed,\" says Peter Goelz, a former managing director of US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). \"That's the first clue to what went wrong.\" \nTurbines are crucial rotating components that play a key role in extracting energy to generate thrust.\n\"If the engines weren't producing power, investigators have a serious case on their hands - and the focus will shift sharply to the cockpit.\"\nWhat happened in the cockpit will be revealed by the Boeing 787's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or the \"black boxes\" - which, investigators say, will help tell the story. (Indian officials say the recorders have been recovered from the crash site.)\nThese devices capture extensive flight data and cockpit audio - from pilot radio calls to ambient cockpit sounds. Voice recordings come from individual pilot mics, radio transmissions and an area microphone that picks up background noise in the cockpit.\nData recorders track with high precision the position of gear and flap levers, thrust settings, engine performance, fuel flow and even fire handle activation. \n\"If the flight data recorder shows the engines were making full power, then the attention will move to the flaps and slats. If they are found to be extended as needed, then it becomes a very difficult investigation,\" says Mr Goelz. \nFlaps and slats increase lift at lower speeds, helping an aircraft take off and land safely by allowing it to fly slower without stalling.\n\"If [the trail leads] to a problem in the flight management control system, that would raise serious concerns - not just for Boeing, but for the entire aviation industry.\"\nThe Boeing 787's flight management control system is a highly automated suite that manages navigation, performance and guidance. It integrates data from a number of sensors to optimise the aircraft's flight path and fuel efficiency.\nWith over 1,100 Boeing 787s flying worldwide since 2011, investigators must determine whether this was a systemic issue that could affect the global fleet - or a one-off failure unique to this flight, experts say. \"If it points to a system problem, then the regulatory bodies have to make some tough decisions very quickly,\" says Mr Goelz.\nSo far, there is no indication of fault on anyone's part. India's civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday that a recent inspection of Air India's Boeing 787 fleet - 24 of 33 aircraft have been checked so far - \"did not reveal any major safety concern,\" adding that the planes and maintenance systems complied with existing standards.\nBoeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said on 12 June:  \"Boeing will defer to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) for information on Air India Flight 171, in line with UN ICAO protocol.\"\nDecoding of the data at the AAIB lab in Delhi will be led by Indian investigators, with experts from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India and Indian regulators. Investigators from the NTSB and UK will also be participating.\n\"In my experience, teams can usually determine what happened fairly quickly,\" Mr Goelz says. \"But understanding why it happened can take much longer.\"\nThe wreckage may yield other clues. \"Every part - wire, nut, bolt - will be meticulously collected,\" says Mr Chinta. \nTypically, wreckage is moved to a nearby hangar or secure facility, laid out to identify the nose, tail and wingtips, and then pieced together. In this case, depending on what the flight data and voice recorders reveal, a full reconstruction may not be necessary, investigators say.\nThe importance of wreckage varies by accident, say investigators. For Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, it was crucial -  reconstruction of the nose revealed clear shrapnel damage from a Russia-made missile.\nIn the wreckage, investigators will also examine fuel filters, lines, valves and residual fuel to check for contamination - something that's easy to detect or rule out, a crash investigator who preferred to remain unnamed, said. Also, he believed that the refuelling equipment used before departure \"has likely been quarantined and already inspected\".\nThat's not all. Investigators will gather maintenance and fault history records from the airline and Boeing's ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting system) which transmits data via radio or satellite to both Boeing and Air India, says Mr Chinta.\nThey will review all flights operated by the aircraft and the crew over recent months, along with the technical log of pilot-reported faults and corrective actions taken before release of aircraft to service.\nInvestigators will also examine pilot licences, training records, simulator performance and instructor remarks - including how pilots handled scenarios like engine failures in advanced flight simulators. \"I reckon Air India would have already provided these records to the investigation team,\" says Mr Chinta.\nInvestigators will review the service history of all components of the aircraft that were removed and replaced, examining reported defects for any recurring issues - or signs of problems that could have affected this flight.\n\"These investigations are extraordinarily complex. They take time, but there will be early indicators of what likely went wrong,\" says Mr Goelz.\nA big reason is how far technology has come. \"One of the first accidents I investigated in 1994 had a flight data recorder tracking just four parameters,\" he says.\n\"Today's recorders capture hundreds - if not thousands - every second. That alone has transformed the way we investigate crashes.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "\"When I heard the attack happened, the ground fell from beneath my feet. All the parents started running towards the bus, no-one could understand what was going on,\" Nasir Mehmood, a sergeant in Pakistan's army tells us.\nNasir and I are in the city of Quetta, sitting in the waiting room of the largest military hospital in the province of Balochistan.  His 14-year-old son Mohammad Ahmad told him he was flung across the army school bus in a bombing in Khuzdar, a few hours' drive away.\nThe bus was carrying around 40 schoolchildren when it exploded at about 07:40 local time (02:40 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\"I reached the hospital, and there were screams of children everywhere, it was the only thing you could hear,\" Nasir said. \"My eyes just kept searching for my son.\"\nOnly the most serious cases were airlifted to the Combined Military Hospital. The military have said the death toll has now risen to eight, with six children killed and dozens injured. No group has admitted carrying out the attack.\nIt is rare for foreign journalists to be allowed to enter the province, south-west of Pakistan, let alone a hospital on the army's compound. The military said they wanted international media to witness the impact of the attack themselves.\nPakistan alleges India is linked to the attack, though there is no independent evidence - and it is a claim Delhi firmly denies.\nIndia and Pakistan are in the midst of a fragile ceasefire, after a two-week conflict that was their most significant one in decades. It saw them exchange drone attacks, missiles and artillery fire, and left dozens of casualties. \nThis attack in Balochistan is now in the middle of the tensions, with news channels broadcasting pictures of the children who were killed, most of them girls between the ages of 12 and 16, alongside accusations of an \"Indian terror campaign\". Images of scrapped metal, children's shoes and abandoned backpacks strewn along the scene highlight the tragedy.\n\nAs we walked through the intensive care unit, some children lay unconscious on their beds, others thrashed in pain. One young girl kept calling out for her mother as nurses tried to calm her. Doctors told us several children were in critical condition, having suffered extensive trauma, burns and fractured bones. The night before we arrived, another child had died. \nPakistan's Minister of Information, Attaullah Tarar, says there is a history of Indian proxies operating in Balochistan. In turn, India says that Pakistan has been harbouring militants who wage attacks on Indian-administered Kashmir for years. \nThe killing of 26 people in April, most of them tourists in Pahalgam, sparked the most recent conflict. Pakistan has called for an open investigation led by an independent party.\nHowever, Tarar denied that such an investigation was necessary in Balochistan.\n\"Pahalgam was a one-off incident,\" he told us. \"We are the victims in this case. We have been suffering. There is a history. We have evidence. So what can I say?\"\nWhen we asked him what that evidence was, he once again pointed to claims of a history of attacks.  He gave us no other details of India's alleged involvement in this attack.\nLater, an officer drove us through Quetta's roads in a bus flanked by soldiers carrying rifles and ammunition hanging from their pockets.\nBalochistan has experienced decades of militant attacks linked to a nationalist insurgency. It is home to several groups which accuse the government of exploiting its natural resources.\nIn March, some 21 people, most of them off-duty security personnel, were killed during a train siege in Balochistan's remote Sibi district.\nThat attack was carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). \nPakistan, as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation.\nAs the military responds to the insurgency, activists in Balochistan accuse Pakistan's security forces of human rights violations. They say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared in the last two decades, and are allegedly detained without due legal process.\nThe minister of information told us the government believed \"faceless courts\" might be needed in the province, hiding the identities of the judges and prosecutors in terror cases. Tarar said the courts often fail to convict the accused, because of a fear of retribution from militant groups.\nIn a press conference, the military spokesperson, Lt Gen Chaudhry, said the school bus attack  \"had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India's provocation\".\nThe government says it is raising the issue \"across diplomatic channels\" around the world. \nThe impact on the ceasefire and on the prospect of talks between India and Pakistan remains to be seen.\nAdditional reporting by Malik Mudassir",

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.\nA new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.\nIndia bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  \nCommon in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. \nThey can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.\n\"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups,\" says Dr Abdul Ghafur, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. \"We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die.\"\nThe irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.\n\"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need,\" says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.\nThe study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. \nResearchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. \nFor example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. \nWhat prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? \nPhysicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.\n\"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all,\" says Dr Ghafur. \"We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do.\"\nTo improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. \n\"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist,\" says Dr Ghafur. \"Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice.\"\nTo fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.\nIndia bears one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.\n\"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics,\" says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from promising new antibiotics to advanced diagnostics.\nDr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. \nThis would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. \nInnovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a \"hub-and-spoke approach\" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programmes, researchers say.\nWithout access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. \n\"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access,\" says Dr Ghafur. \"When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients.\" \nClearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of meters into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture. That's what makes them special,\" explains chef Alka Jena, who chronicles the history and recipes of Odia dishes on her food blog Culinary Xpress. \"The fish provides protein, saga bhaja adds fibre and badi chura adds crunch and umami.\"\n\"On a scorching hot day, there's nothing quite like relishing a bowl of pakhala with a variety of sides and washing it down with some sour torani,\" Jena adds. \"It not only cools your tummy but also provides a glimpse into Odisha's rich culture and heritage.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo reading this article\nThe Air India tragedy, in which at least 270 people died, involved one of Boeing's most innovative and popular planes. Until now, it was considered one of its safest too. \nWe still do not know why flight 171 crashed just 30 seconds after take-off. Investigators have now recovered flight recorder data and are working hard to find out. But the incident has drawn attention to the aircraft involved: the 787 Dreamliner, the first of a modern generation of radical, fuel-efficient planes.\nPrior to the accident, the 787 had operated for nearly a decade and a half without any major accidents and without a single fatality. During that period, according to Boeing, it carried more than a billion passengers. There are currently more than 1,100 in service worldwide.\nHowever, it has also suffered from a series of quality control problems. \nWhistleblowers who worked on the aircraft have raised numerous concerns about production standards. Some have claimed that potentially dangerously flawed aircraft have been allowed into service \u2013 allegations the company has consistently denied.\nIt was on a chilly December morning in 2009 that a brand-new aircraft edged out onto the runway at Paine Field airport near Seattle and, as a cheering crowd looked on, accelerated into a cloudy sky.\nThe flight was the culmination of years of development and billions of dollars worth of investment.\nThe 787 was conceived in the early 2000s, at a time of rising oil prices, when the increasing cost of fuel had become a major preoccupation for airlines. Boeing decided to build a long-haul plane for them that would set new standards in efficiency.\n\"In the late 1990s, Boeing was working on a design called the Sonic Cruiser,\" explains aviation historian Shea Oakley. \nThis was firstly conceived as a plane that would use advanced materials and the latest technology to carry up to 250 passengers at just under the speed of sound. The initial emphasis was on speed and cutting journey times, rather than fuel economy.\n\"But then the effects of 9/11 hit the world airline industry quite hard,\" says Mr Oakley.\n\"The airlines told Boeing what they really needed was the most fuel-efficient, economical long-range jetliner ever produced. They now wanted an aeroplane with a similar capacity to the Sonic Cruiser, minus the high speed.\"\nBoeing abandoned its initial concept, and began work on what became the 787. In doing so, it helped create a new business model for airlines.\nInstead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between \"hub\" airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, they could now fly smaller aircraft on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable.\nAt the time Boeing's great rival, the European giant Airbus, was taking precisely the opposite approach. It was developing the gargantuan A380 superjumbo \u2013 a machine tailor-made for carrying as many passengers as possible on busy routes between the world's biggest and busiest airports.\nIn hindsight, Boeing's approach was wiser. The fuel-thirsty A380 went out of production in 2021, after only 251 had been built. \n\"Airbus thought the future was giant hubs where people would always want to change planes in Frankfurt or Heathrow or Narita,\" explains aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, who is a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \n\"Boeing said 'no, people want to fly point to point'. And Boeing was extremely right.\"\nThe 787 was a truly radical aircraft. It was the first commercial plane to be built primarily of composites such as carbon fibre, rather than aluminium, in order to reduce weight. It had advanced aerodynamics to reduce drag. \nIt also used highly efficient modern engines from General Electric and Rolls Royce, and it replaced many mechanical and pneumatic systems with lighter electrical ones.\nAll of this, Boeing said, would make it 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. It was also significantly quieter, with a noise footprint (the area on the ground affected by significant noise from the aircraft) that the manufacturer said was up to 60% smaller.\nNot long after the aircraft entered service, however, there were serious problems. In January 2013, lithium-ion batteries caught fire aboard a 787 as it waited at a gate at Boston's Logan International Airport. \nA week later, overheating batteries forced another 787 to make an emergency landing during an internal flight in Japan.\nThe design was grounded worldwide for several months, while Boeing came up with a solution.\nSince then, day to day operations have been smoother, but production has been deeply problematic. Analysts say this may, in part, have been due to Boeing's decision to set up a new assembly line for the 787 in North Charleston, South Carolina \u2013 more than 2000 miles from its Seattle heartlands.\nThis was done to take advantage of the region's low rates of union membership, as well as generous support from the state.\n\"There were serious development issues,\" says Mr Aboulafia. \"Some notable production issues, related especially to the decision to create Boeing's first ever production line outside of the Puget Sound area.\"\nIn 2019, Boeing discovered the first of a series of manufacturing defects that affected the way in which different parts of the aircraft fitted together. As more problems were found, the company widened its investigations \u2013 and uncovered further issues.\nDeliveries were heavily disrupted, and halted altogether between May 2021 and July 2022, before being paused again the following year.\nHowever, potentially the most damaging allegations about the 787 programme have come from the company's own current and former employees. \nAmong the most prominent was the late John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the 787 factory in South Carolina. He claimed that pressure to produce planes as quickly as possible had seriously undermined safety.\nIn 2019, he told the BBC that workers at the plant had failed to follow strict procedures intended to track components through the factory, potentially allowing defective parts to go missing. In some cases, he said, workers had even deliberately fitted substandard parts from scrap bins to aircraft in order to avoid delays on the production line.\nHe also maintained that defective fixings were used to secure aircraft decks. Screwing them into place produced razor-sharp slivers of metal, which in some cases accumulated beneath the deck in areas containing large amounts of aircraft wiring.\nHis claims had previously been passed to the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, which partially upheld them. After investigating, it concluded that at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts had gone missing in the factory.\nAn audit by the FAA also confirmed that metal shavings were present beneath the floors of a number of aircraft.\nBoeing said its board analysed the problem and decided it did not \"present a safety of flight issue\", though the fixings were subsequently redesigned. The company later said it had \"fully resolved the FAA's findings regarding part traceability and implemented corrective actions to prevent recurrence\".\nMr Barnett remained concerned that aircraft that had already gone into service could be carrying hidden defects serious enough to cause a major accident. \"I believe it's just a matter of time before something big happens with a 787,\" he told me in 2019. \"I pray that I am wrong.\"\nIn early 2024, Mr Barnett took his own life. At the time he had been giving evidence in a long-running whistleblower lawsuit against the company \u2013 which he maintained had victimised him as a result of his allegations. Boeing denied this.\nMuch of what he had alleged echoed previous claims by another former quality manager at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens. \nIn 2011, she had complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving.\nMs Kitchens, who left Boeing in 2016, also claimed employees had been told to overlook substandard work, and said defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, had been deliberately installed on planes \u2013 creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits.\nBoeing has not responded to these specific allegations but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 \"after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan\". It says that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, \"alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues\", which was dismissed.\nMore recently, a third whistleblower made headlines when testifying before a senate committee last year. \nSam Salehpour, a current Boeing employee, told US lawmakers he had come forward because \"the safety problems I have observed at Boeing, if not addressed could result in a catastrophic failure of a commercial aeroplane that would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives\".\nThe quality engineer said that while working on the 787 in late 2020, he had seen the company introduce shortcuts in assembly processes, in order to speed up production and delivery of the aircraft. These, he said, \"had allowed potentially defective parts and defective installations in 787 fleets\".\nHe also noted that on the majority of aircraft he looked at, tiny gaps in the joints between sections of fuselage had not been properly rectified. This, he said, meant those joints would be prone to \"premature fatigue failure over time\" and created \"extremely unsafe conditions for the aircraft\" with \"potentially catastrophic\" consequences.\nHe suggested that more than 1,000 aircraft \u2013 the bulk of the 787 fleet \u2013 could be affected.\nBoeing insists that \"claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate\". It says: \"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous examination under US Federal Aviation Administration oversight. This analysis has validated that the aircraft will maintain its durability and service life over several decades, and these issues do not present any safety concerns.\"\nThere is no question that Boeing has come under huge pressure in recent years over its corporate culture and production standards. In the wake of two fatal accidents involving its bestselling 737 Max, and a further serious incident last year, it has been repeatedly accused of putting the pursuit of profit over passenger safety.\nIt is a perception that chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who joined the company last year, has been working hard to overturn - overhauling its internal processes and working with regulators on a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.\nBut has the 787 already been compromised by past failures, that may have created ongoing safety risks?\nRichard Aboulafia believes not. \"You know. It's been 16 years of operations, 1,200 jets and over a billion passengers flown, but no crashes until now,\" he says. \"It's a stellar safety record.\"\nHe thinks that any major issues would already have become apparent.\n\"I really think production problems are more of a short-term concern,\" he says. \"For the past few years, there's been far greater oversight of 787 production.\n\"For older planes, I think any serious problems would have shown up by now.\"\nThe Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was more than 11 years old, having first flown in 2013.\nBut the Foundation for Aviation Safety, a US organisation established by the former Boeing whistleblower Ed Pierson that has previously been highly critical of the company, says it did have concerns about 787s prior to the recent crash.\n\"Yes, it was a possible safety risk,\" claims Mr Pierson. \"We monitor incident reports, we monitor regulatory documents. Airworthiness directives come out that describe various issues, and it does make you wonder.\"\nOne such issue, he argues, is water potentially leaking from washroom taps into electrical equipment bays. Last year, the FAA instructed airlines to carry out regular inspections, following reports that leaks were going undetected on certain 787 models.\nHowever, he stresses that the cause of the recent tragedy is still unknown \u2013 and that it is vital the investigation moves forward quickly, so that any problems, whether they lie with the aircraft, the airline or elsewhere, can be resolved.\nFor the moment, however, the 787's safety record remains strong.\n\"We don't know at this point what caused the Air India crash,\" says Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consulting firm Leeham Company.\n\"But based on what we do know about the plane, I would not hesitate to get on board a 787.\"\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

One British national miraculously survived the crash. \nThe investigation led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is expected to produce a more detailed report in 12 months.\nAccording to data from the flight recorder, both of the plane's fuel control switches moved from the run to the cut-off position in the space of a second, shortly after take-off.\nThe switches are usually only cut off to turn off the engines after landing, or during emergency situations such as an engine fire - rather than during take-off.\nThe cut-off caused both engines to lose thrust, the AAIB report said.\nThere is then confusion heard in the cockpit, with one pilot asking the other why he had switched off the fuel, which the other denied. The Gatwick-bound plane was being piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar. The report does not specify which voice is which.\nThe fuel switches then moved back into their normal in-flight position, automatically starting the process of relighting the engines.

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

A recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.This is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThermal plants are a major contributor of carbon emissions in the countryBut there are challenges.The common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.That's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.Experts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.Even at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.Getty ImagesIndia's been developing renewable sources of energy like wind power - but more needs to be done What's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources. \"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). But the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.Estimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.The country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations.",

        "article_text": "\"Who is responsible for this mess?\"\nThe question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated.\nHeavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours. \nEven a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral. \nThe pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\nFollowing criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late.\nThe crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai.\nFrom Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt.\nExperts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem. \n\"The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,\" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi.\n\"Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,\" he adds.\nExperts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses.\nIndia receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September.\nThe monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent.\nBut experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people.\nThis year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared. \n\"A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,\" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. \nIn Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding.\nThis year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department. \nMany residents reported damage to their property. \nAt least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports.\nMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same. \nOnce known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding.\n\"Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,\" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist.\nThese valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says. \n\"When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.\" \nMr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made.\nViolations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides.\nBut experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain.\n\"The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,\" Mr Kukerja says. \"Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience.\"\nThis isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more. \nOver the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way. \nSo, can anything be done to prevent this?\n\"Yes,\" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy.\nHe suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses.\n\"But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,\" he said.\nFor India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. \nSpeaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while reducing reliance on China.\nTrump also said that $14bn would be invested in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he later told reporters he had yet to see or approve the final deal.\nThe announcement is the latest turn in Trump's rollercoaster approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January. \n\"There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever, and every US steelworker will soon receive a well deserved $5,000 bonus,\" Trump told the crowd, filled with steelworkers, to raucous applause. \nOne of the major concerns from steelworkers about the US-Japan trade deal was how Japan would honour the workers' union contract which regulates pay and hiring. \nTrump began his remarks by saying he had \"saved\" US Steel, America's biggest steel manufacturer, located in Pittsburgh, with the 25% tariffs he implemented during his first term as president in 2018. \nBoth sales and profits at US Steel have been falling in recent years.  \nTrump touted the increase to 50% as a way to ensure US Steel's survival. \n\"At 50%, they can no longer get over the fence,\" he said. \"We are once again going to put Pennsylvania steel into the backbone of America, like never before.\"\nUS steel manufacturing has been declining in recent years, and China, India and Japan have pulled ahead as the world's top producers. Roughly a quarter of all steel used in the US is imported, and the country's reliance on Mexican and Canadian steel has angered Trump.\nThe announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue after the Court of International Trade ordered the administration to halt the taxes. \nHis tariffs on steel and aluminium were untouched by the lawsuit.\n\"It is a good day for steelworkers,\" JoJo Burgess, a member of the local United Steelworkers union who was at Trump's rally, told the BBC. \nMr Burgess, who is also the city mayor of nearby Washington, Pennsylvania, expressed optimism over the reported details of the partnership with Nippon Steel, saying he hoped it would help breed a new generation of steel workers in the area. \nHe recalled \"making a lot of money\" in the years after Trump instituted steel tariffs in his first term.\nAlthough Burgess would not label himself a Trump supporter, and says he has only voted for Democratic nominees for president in the last two decades, he said: \"I'm never going to disagree with something that's going to level the playing field for American manufacturing.\" \nBut so far the impacts of Trump's tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos. Global trade and markets have been upended and cracks have formed - or widened - in relations between the US and other countries, including some of its closest partners. \nThe levies have strained relations between China and the US, the world's two biggest global economies, and launched the countries into a tit-for-tat trade battle.\nOn Friday, without providing details, Trump accused China of violating a truce they had reached over tariffs earlier this month over talks in Geneva.\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later clarified that China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed under the deal.\nChina then shot back with its own accusations of US wrongdoing. Beijing's response on Friday did not address the US claims directly but urged the US to \"cease discriminatory restrictions against China\".\nChina is the world's largest manufacturer of steel, responsible for more than half of global steel production, according to World Steel Association statistics from 2022.\n\"If you don't have steel, you don't have a country. You don't have a country, you can't make a military. What are we going to do? Say, 'Let's go to China to get our steel from the army tanks,'\" Trump quipped at the Pittsburgh rally on Friday.\nTrump's roughly hour-long, wide-ranging rally speech hinted at the deal he said he had made with Japan's Nippon Steel but he did not offer any new details. Both companies have not confirmed any deal was completed.\nUS Steel agreed in December 2023 to be taken over by Nippon in a deal valued at $15bn before it was eventually blocked by President Joe Biden on national security grounds. \nWhile campaigning for president, Trump had said he was \"totally against\" US Steel being taken over by a \"foreign company\". \nHe also said he would \"block it instantaneously\", describing the takeover by Nippon as \"so terrible\".\nUnder the reported new \"partnership\", it is not clear who would own US Steel or who would operate the 124-year-old American business.\nWhite House officials said Trump had convinced Nippon to boost its investment in the US and give the government key say over the operations of the US factories. \nAccording to US media, Japan plans to invest $14bn over 14 months. \nOther reported details include that the companies had said they would maintain ownership of US steel in the US, with US citizens on the board and in leadership positions; pledged not to cut production for 10 years; and agreed to give the government the right to veto potential production cuts after that period.",

        "article_text": "A black box has been found at the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India's civil aviation minister said on Friday. \nThe flight data recorder was recovered within 28 hours by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu confirmed. \nAll but one of the 242 people on the London-bound flight died when it crashed into a residential area less than 60 seconds after take-off on Thursday. An official told the BBC that at least eight people on the ground were also killed.\n\"The [recovery of the black box] marks an important step forward in the investigation\" and will \"significantly aid the inquiry\" into the disaster, Mr Kinjarapu said.\nPlanes usually carry two black boxes - small but tough electronic data recorders. \nOne records flight data, such as altitude and speed. The other records sound from the cockpit, so investigators can hear what the pilots are saying and listen for any unusual noises.\nAAIB is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and UK. Boeing's chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said the company was supporting the investigation. \nAir India said there were 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft when it crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT).\nFlight AI171 was scheduled to land at London's Gatwick Airport at 18:25 BST.\nOn Friday, the wreckage was still scattered across the crash site, including the blackened wing of the plane, with large pieces of the aircraft stuck in buildings.\nInvestigators arrived at the scene and crowds were moved further away from the wreckage. \nA doctor told the BBC that they are relying on DNA from relatives to identify the victims. A police official at the post-mortem room told the BBC that the remains of six people had been released to families so far, as their relatives were able to identify them based on facial features.\nThe sole survivor of the crash, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A on the flight, is still recovering in hospital. \n\"I still cannot believe how I made it out alive,\" he told India's state broadcaster DD News on Thursday.\n\"At first, I thought I was going to die. I managed to open my eyes, unfastened my seat belt and tried to exit the plane.\"\nMr Ramesh, 40, who sustained burn injuries on his left hand, said he saw the aircraft crew and its passengers die in front of his eyes.\nMeanwhile, desperate families are still waiting for news of their relatives. \nImtiaz Ali, whose brother Javed and his family were on the flight, said that until he sees his brother's body, he will not believe he has died.\n\"If I get sad and start crying, then I'll be uncontrollable,\" he told the BBC. \n\"No-one will be able to stop me... my heart might burst.\" \nThe plane crashed in a residential area called Meghani Nagar and, even though it had just taken off, the impact was severe. Wreckage spread over 200m (656ft), according to responders. \nIt is still unclear exactly how many were killed on the ground, but the BBC has been told that at least eight people, who were not on the aircraft, have died. \nDr Minakshi Parikh, the dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, said four of their students died as the plane crashed into buildings on the campus.\n\"There were also four relatives of our doctors who were on the campus when the aircraft crashed - they too were killed,\" Dr Parikh said.\n\"We are relying only on DNA matching to identify them and it is something where we simply cannot rush or afford mistakes. \n\"We are working with sincerity. We want relatives to understand, and be a bit patient. We want to hand over [the bodies] as soon as possible.\" \nOn Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent around 20 minutes at the site of the plane crash. \nHe did not speak to reporters afterwards but a video posted on his YouTube channel showed him walking around the site and inspecting the debris.\nModi also visited the location of a now-viral image that shows the tail of the crashed plane lodged in a building. \nEarlier on Friday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson also went to the crash site, later describing the visit as \"deeply moving\".\nAccording to data by tracking website, Flightradar24, the Boeing Dreamliner 787-8 had completed more than 700 flights in the year leading up to the Thursday's disaster. \nThe Air India plane was 11 years old and its most common routes included flights between Mumbai and Dubai, as well as the capital New Delhi and European destinations such as Milan, Paris and Amsterdam.\nThe plane had operated 25 flights from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick in the past two years.\nIndia's aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 fleet, describing it as a \"preventive measure\".",

        "article_text": "Could India's decades-long jungle insurgency finally be approaching its end?\nLast week, the country's most-wanted Maoist, Nambala Keshava Rao - popularly known as Basavaraju - was killed along with 26 others in a major security operation in the central state of Chhattisgarh. Home Minister Amit Shah called it \"the most decisive strike\" against the insurgency in three decades. One police officer also died in the encounter.\nBasavaraju's death marks more than a tactical victory - it signals a breach in the Maoists' last line of defence in Bastar, the forested heartland where the group carved out its fiercest stronghold since the 1980s.\nMaoists, also known as \"Naxalites\" after the 1967 uprising in Naxalbari village in West Bengal, have regrouped over the decades to carve out a \"red corridor\" across central and eastern India - stretching from Jharkhand in the east to Maharashtra in the west and spanning more than a third of the country's districts. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh had described the insurgency as India's \"greatest internal security threat\".\nThe armed struggle for Communist rule has claimed nearly 12,000 lives since 2000, according to the South Asian Terrorism Portal. The rebels say they fight for the rights of indigenous tribes and the rural poor, citing decades of state neglect and land dispossession.\nThe Maoist movement - officially known as Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) - took formal shape in 2004 with the merger of key Marxist-Leninist groups into the CPI (Maoist). This party traces its ideological roots to a 1946 peasant uprising in the southern state of Telangana.\nNow, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government pledging to end Maoism by March 2026, the battle-hardened rebellion stands at a crossroads: could this truly be the end - or just another pause in its long, bloody arc?\n\"There will be a lull. But Marxist-Leninist movements have transcended such challenges when the top leadership of the Naxalites were killed in the 70s and yet we are talking about Naxalism,\" said N Venugopal, a  journalist, social scientist and long-time observer of the movement, who is both a critic and sympathiser of the Maoists. \nOne of the senior-most officials in India's home ministry who oversaw anti-Maoist operations, MA Ganapathy, holds a different view.\n\"At its core, the Maoist movement was an ideological struggle - but that ideology has lost traction, especially among the younger generation. Educated youth aren't interested anymore,\" says Mr Ganapathy.\n\"With Basavaraju neutralised, morale is low. They're on their last leg.\"\nThe federal home ministry's latest report notes a 48% drop in violent incidents in Maoist-related violence - from 1,136 in 2013 to 594 in 2023 - and a 65% decline in related deaths, from 397 to 138. \nHowever, it acknowledges a slight rise in security force casualties in 2023 compared to 2022, attributed to intensified operations in core Maoist areas.\nThe report says Chhattisgarh remained the worst-affected state in 2023, accounting for 63% of all Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) incidents and 66% of the related deaths. \nJharkhand followed, with 27% of the violence and 23% of the deaths. The remaining incidents were reported from Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.\nThe collapse of Maoism in Chhattisgarh, a stronghold of the insurgency, offers key clues to the movement's broader decline.\nA decade ago, the state's police were seen as weak, according to Mr Ganapathy.\n\"Today, precise state-led strikes, backed by central paramilitary forces, have changed the game. While paramilitary held the ground, state forces gathered intelligence and launched targeted operations. It was clear role delineation and coordination,\" he said.\nMr Ganapathy adds that access to mobile phones, social media, roads and connectivity have made people more aware and less inclined to support an armed underground movement.\n\"People have become aspirational, mobile phones and social media have become widespread and people are exposed to the outside world. Maoists also cannot operate in hiding in remote jungles while being out of sync with new social realities. \n\"Without mass support, no insurgency can survive,\" he says.\nA former Maoist sympathiser, who did not want to be named, pointed to a deeper flaw behind the movement's collapse: a political disconnect.\n\"They delivered real change - social justice in Telangana, uniting tribespeople in Chhattisgarh - but failed to forge it into a cohesive political force,\" he said.\nAt the heart of the failure, he argued, was a dated revolutionary vision: building isolated \"liberated zones\" beyond the state's reach and \"a theory to strike the state through a protracted people's war\".\n\"These pockets work only until the state pushes back. Then the zones collapse, and thousands die. It's time to ask - can a revolution really be led from cut-off forestlands in today's India?\"\nThe CPI (Maoist)'s 2007 political document clings to a Mao-era strategy: of creating a \"liberated zone\" and \"encircling the cities from the countryside.\" But the sympathiser was blunt: \"That doesn't work anymore.\"\nThe party still retains some popular support in a few isolated pockets, primarily in the tribal regions of eastern Maharashtra, southern Chhattisgarh and parts of Odisha and Jharkhand - but without a strong military base.\nOngoing operations by state forces have significantly weakened the Maoist military infrastructure in their strongholds in southern Chhattisgarh. Cadres and leaders are now being killed regularly, reflecting the rebels' growing inability to defend themselves.\nMr Venugopal believes the strategy needs rethinking - not abandonment.\nThe underground struggle has its place, he said, but \"the real challenge is blending it with electoral politics\".\nIn contrast, Mr Ganapathy sees little hope for the Maoists to mount a meaningful fightback in the near future and argues that the time has come for a different approach - dialogue.\n\"It would be wise for them to go for talks now and perhaps unconditionally or even lay down the conditions and let the government consider them. This is the time to approach the government instead of unnecessarily sacrificing their own cadres, without a purpose,\" he said.\nMaoists enjoy support in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from mainstream political parties. In Telangana, both the ruling Congress and the main opposition Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) have backed calls for a ceasefire, along with 10 smaller Left parties - an effort widely seen as aimed at protecting the group's remaining leaders and cadres. \nThe Maoist movement, rooted in past struggles against caste oppression, still carries social legitimacy in parts of these states. Civil society activists have also joined the push for a truce.\n\"We, along with other civil rights groups, demanded a two-step process - an immediate ceasefire followed by peace talks,\" said Ranjit Sur, general secretary of the Kolkata-based group Association for Protection of Democratic Rights.\nMaoist-affected states remain resilient strongholds in part because they are rich in minerals - making them sites of intense resource battles. Mr Venugopal believes this is key to the CPI (Maoist's) enduring presence.\nChhattisgarh, for instance, is India's sole producer of tin concentrates and moulding sand, and a leading source of coal, dolomite, bauxite and high-grade iron ore, according to the ministry of mines. \nIt accounts for 36% of the country's tin, 20% iron ore, 18% coal, 11% dolomite and 4% of diamond and marble reserves. Yet, despite strong interest, mining companies - both global and national - have long struggled to access these resources.\n\"Multinational companies couldn't enter because the Maoist movement, built on the slogan 'Jal, Jangal, Jameen (Water, Forest, Land),' asserted that forests belong to tribespeople - not corporations,\" Mr Venugopal said.\nBut with the Maoists now weakened, at least four Chhattisgarh mines are set to go to \"preferred bidders\" after successful auctions in May, according to an official notification. \nMr Venugopal believes that the resistance won't die with the death of Maoist leaders.\n\"Leaders may fall, but the anger remains. Wherever injustice exists, there will be movements. We may not call them Maoism anymore - but they'll be there.\"",

In Poland, the swan stands for purity, loyalty and resilience, while in Hungary, it epitomises loyalty, grace and the beauty of nature.\"\nGroup Captain Shukla added that in Indian culture, a swan is also the vehicle of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning and wisdom.\n\"To carry the swan to space is to carry the pursuit of knowledge, clarity of purpose and grace under pressure,\" he said.\nAxiom Space says Joy was chosen after the crew considered a number of animals, including dinosaurs and lions.

        "article_text": "Warning: The story contains distressing details \nA BBC Hindi investigation reveals that Indian officials quietly paid compensation to the families of more people than they admit died in a deadly crowd crush at the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival which is the world's largest religious gathering.\nThe official death toll is 37, but the BBC found 26 additional cases where families received partial compensation in cash, and 18 more deaths where no payment was made.\nOn 25 March, a team of plain-clothed police officers from India's northern Uttar Pradesh (UP) state arrived in neighbouring Bihar with bundles of cash.\nThe team visited Gopalganj city, where they met the family of 62-year-old Tara Devi. They handed over 500,000 rupees ($5,758; \u00a34,291) in cash to her son, Dhananjay Gond, and asked him to record a statement on video.\nIn the video, Dhananjay introduces himself, saying: \"My mother Tara Devi and I went to the Kumbh Mela for a holy dip. My mother died. Officers from UP came and gave us 500,000 rupees. We have received it.\"\nDhananjay says his mother was killed in the crowd crush in the city of Prayagraj in UP on 29 January.\nThe UP government has not yet released an official list of the crush victims. Tara Devi's son says police told him the money he got was the first instalment of the 2.5m rupees officially promised to victims' families. Dhananjay says he hasn't received the remaining 2m rupees.\nThe UP government says it has paid 2.5m rupees each to the families of 35 victims (of the 37 deaths, one victim remains unidentified, and another does not have a legal heir). A three-member judicial commission set up to investigate the incident and submit a report within a month has had its tenure extended.\nThe BBC, however, found one more family which was given a cheque of 2.5m rupees. For the other 35 victims, the compensation was transferred to relatives' bank accounts.\nApart from this, the BBC found 26 cases - including that of Tara Devi - where police paid 500,000 rupees in cash at people's homes.\nIn many instances, officials had families sign documents blaming health issues for the deaths, despite them insisting that their relatives died in the crush. (The UP government typically does not compensate for natural deaths during the Kumbh, held every 12 years.)\nThe BBC also confirmed 18 deaths where no compensation was given (excluding the case mentioned above where there was no legal heir).\nIt also found evidence of four separate crush incidents in Prayagraj on 29 January, despite Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's claim that only one occurred at what is called the Sangam nose - the point of confluence of three sacred rivers, Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati.\nIn the weeks after the Kumbh crush, the BBC met over 100 families across 11 states in India, who claimed their relatives died in the tragedy. It verified 82 deaths in total with concrete evidence, excluding cases lacking proof.\nSome families hold post-mortems, morgue slips, death certificates, or photos and videos as proof. The BBC cross-checked local newspaper reports and spoke to district reporters to trace where bodies were received, mapped these locations, and then visited the victims' families.\nThe BBC interviewed families and eyewitnesses to reconstruct timelines for each case - when the victims left for the holy dip, the time of the crush, nearby landmarks, the distance from the bathing site and the immediate aftermath.\nFrom these detailed accounts, clear patterns emerged, leading to the identification of four crush locations: Sangam Nose, Jhusi side of Samudrakup Chauraha, Airavat Marg, and Mukti Marg Chauraha near Kalpavriksha Gate.\nMost of the full 2.5m-rupee compensation cases list the death location as \"Ward No. 7, Fort Cantt, Prayagraj\", about 1.5km (0.9 miles) from Sangam Nose.\nIn contrast, the cases that received 500,000 rupees mostly mention \"Sector-20 or Sector-21, Kumbh Mela area, Jhusi\". Some of these families claim their relatives also died near Sangam Nose, but that their certificates wrongly cite Jhusi - possibly to downplay the scale of the tragedy there.\nAs for the 18 families which did not receive any compensation, there does not seem to be a common thread binding them.\nFor instance, at one crush location, the BBC identified five bodies through photos and the numbers issued during post-death formalities. Of these, the families of three victims received 500,000 rupees in cash, while the other two received nothing. Some other families have photographs from the day of the crush which show bodies of their relatives, but these deaths have not been acknowledged by the government.\nThe BBC repeatedly tried to contact UP government officials, emailing the information department and district magistrate. Despite promises by the district magistrate's office, no call was arranged. Attempts to reach the UP police chief went unanswered, while Prayagraj's police commissioner at the time of the incident, Tarun Gaba, and Mela officer Vijay Kiran Anand refused to answer questions.\nThe BBC has also found evidence of deaths in crushes that took place at locations other than the Sangam Nose, which the government has acknowledged through giving some compensation.\nIn UP's Jaunpur, Dharmraj Rajbhar received 500,000 rupees each for the deaths of his wife and daughter-in-law in the Airavat Marg crush.\nA video shot by the BBC on 29 January shows the family sitting with both bodies at the site. Back home, Rajbhar displayed the cash bundles and said, \"The government promised 2.5m rupees, but the police gave only 500,000 rupees each and left.\"\nThe UP police also travelled hundreds of kilometres to Paschim Bardhaman in West Bengal, where they handed over 500,000 rupees to the family of Vinod Ruidas.\nNot all families accepted the amount, though. In Bihar, the relatives of Sunaina Devi rejected it. They told the BBC that they refused to \"sign false documents\".\nThe BBC also identified at least\u202ffive families\u202fwho lost their relatives near Kalpavriksha Gate, about 3-4km from Sangam Nose.\nKusum Devi, the wife of Panne Lal Sahni, says that her husband died around 8am on 29 January. \"People were stepping over his body. I sat in the sun with his corpse until 4pm. No-one even gave us water,\" she says. The family received 500,000 rupees in cash.\nRelatives of all five people who died near the Kalpavriksha Gate, had similar stories to narrate - they sat with the bodies from\u202fmorning till evening.\nOver time, 18 more families came forward claiming their relatives died in the crush but they haven't received compensation yet.\nAmong the 18 is Meena Pandey from Sultanpur, UP, who travelled to the Kumbh with her husband, and neighbour Archana Singh. Archana recalls sitting with Meena's body at the crush site until 3pm - seven hours after the crush.\nDespite claims of 2,750 AI-enabled CCTVs, 50,000 security personnel, drones and ambulances, no help arrived, relatives said.\nBy afternoon the body had begun to decay, says Archana.\n\"We had no choice but to carry it home in our vehicle.\"\nLike Meena Pandey's family, relatives of Shyamlal Gond from UP's Deoria are still waiting for compensation.\nHis son, Bhagirathi Gond, works as a daily wage labourer in Bengaluru. After the crush, he travelled to Prayagraj looking for his father, and reached the hospital on 3 February.\nAccording to a slip from the hospital, Shyamlal Gond was brought in dead at 10.02 local time on 29 January.\n\"My father was listed as unidentified. To maintain records, they [hospital staff] had kept a file. They took a photo of the body in the condition it was found and pasted it into a register.\"\nHe adds, \"It was difficult to identify him through the photo. After the fall, his head was bent down, chest pushed upward, and his face had slightly turned.\"\nBhagirathi says the hospital staff would not give him a death certificate or any other papers.\n\"They told me to take the body, but I said I would only do so if some official procedure was followed,\" he said.\nIt took four months before he got the death certificate. But he is still waiting for compensation for his loss.\n\"The government has still not acknowledged that my father died in the crush.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "India has always taken a hard position on coal, arguing that it is crucial for its energy security and developmental needs.\nBut energy experts and environment campaigners are increasingly saying it should at least try to decarbonise or curtail emissions from coal-fired power plants, if it can't be phased out altogether. \n\"You can't wish away coal,\" Ashok Lavasa, a former secretary of union ministries of finance, and environment, forest and climate change, said at an event on 1 July.\n\"The question is, if coal is king, then can it be a benevolent king?\"\nThis signals to the fact that, realistically speaking, coal - albeit cleaner coal - may remain the primary power source of energy in India, despite years of international climate talks asking for the highly polluting fossil fuel to be phased out entirely. \nBut why has India - the world's third largest carbon emitter - decided to stick to coal in the first place? After all, the country has international obligations to significantly cut its carbon emissions, along with its own target to bring down the levels to net zero by 2070.\nA part of the answer lies in the rising power demands of the country.\nIndia's electricity demand has grown by more than 9% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing a previous prediction of 6.6% - and it is now forecasted to double by 2030.\nCoal-fired power plants have generated more than 70% of the total electricity supply every year since the early 2000s - a figure that remains unchanged. \nBut the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.\nEstimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.\nThe country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations. They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.\nEven at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.\nWhat's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources.\n\"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). \nExperts say constant supply from thermal plants is crucial for the stability of the grid, or the network of towers and transmission lines that carries electricity from power plants to consumers.\n\"Any large mismatch of demand and supply will destabilise the grid and that can mean power-cuts and blackouts, similar to what we recently saw in Spain,\" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, an independent power sector expert.\nWith all these factors at play, India is looking to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, instead of phasing out coal completely. \nA recent report by the CSE said that decarbonisation from coal-based thermal plants alone can cut down the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.\nThis is particularly significant given the country's commitment to reduce emissions intensity (carbon emissions produced per unit of a country's economic output) by 45% by 2030 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nBut there are challenges.\nThe common problem thermal plants face is that they must keep running at least at 55% capacity even at daytime, despite having alternate renewable sources like wind and solar power to rely on.\nThat's because operators cannot ramp up capacity to the fullest at short notice, particularly during the peak hours of evening when supply from renewables is down.\nExperts say there is an urgent need to make thermal plants more efficient so they can run at a lower capacity.\n\"How low can we go [to bring down the minimum running level threshold] is the question,\" said Ramesh Veeravalli, a member with India's Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, speaking at the event. \"Technically it is possible.\"\nAnother way to improve efficiency of plants is to adapt technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from escaping into the atmosphere\nBut some say this has produced limited results, with one estimate by the World Resources Institute saying the technology at present captures only about 0.1% of the global emissions.\nA third suggestion is to burn agricultural residue in the place of coal in thermal plants.\n\"This idea has led to a substantial reduction in coal usage in thermal power plants in Delhi and surrounding cities,\" said Parth Kumar, a programme manager with CSE that has suggested methods of reducing emissions in its recent report.\n\"But other parts of the country are yet to adopt this seriously, even though regulation requires them to,\" he added.\nExperts say that reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants would need larger systemic changes, involving huge costs.\nBut how much that cost would come down to - and who would bear it - are tough questions with no immediate answers.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

They generate electricity when the sun is up and the wind is blowing.Even at daytime, experts say, supply from renewables can fluctuate, whereas thermal plants remain a constant source of electricity and are able to cater to peak demand in the evenings and at nighttime.Getty ImagesIndia's been developing renewable sources of energy like wind power - but more needs to be done What's more, India's energy storage capacity - or the ability to store excess electricity from renewables at daytime - has not been able to keep pace with the expansion of resources. \"This means that there is no other option [other than thermal energy for constant supply] unless and until we have large-scale storage quantities in the system,\" said Rajiv Porwal, director with Grid India, the grid controller of India under the ministry of power, speaking at the 1July event, organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). But the environmental cost of this reliance on coal is huge.Estimates suggest that India's electricity generation alone accounts for more than 40% of the annual carbon emissions \u2013 and nearly three-quarters of that electricity comes from coal-burning.The country has made progress in meeting its renewable energy targets - it contributes 46% of India's total installed capacity - but renewable sources have limitations.",

        "article_text": "Shubman Gill poses with his newest Test bat, inscribed with his 'Prince' nickname\nShubman Gill is not short on confidence.\nNicknamed 'Prince' by India cricket supporters, he is regarded as the next big thing to follow the 'Little Master' Sachin Tendulkar and 'King' Virat Kohli.\nIndia's prince is now a ruler, though, with the fresh-faced batter taking over the Test captaincy reins from Rohit Sharma for this summer's tour of England.\nThe fact Gill has leaned into the 'Prince' moniker by having it inscribed on his bat - to the annoyance of some fans - underlines the unwavering belief in his talents.\nBut is Gill as good as those who came before him? Is he a smart choice as captain? And how can England get the better of him this summer?\nLet's start with the most impressive of all Gill stats: he has the second-best one-day international batting average of all time (59), sandwiched between the Netherlands' Ryan ten Doeschate (67), who is on the India coaching staff for this tour, and Kohli (58) himself.\nMaybe it's unfair to draw comparisons in Test cricket just yet, but there's no denying 25-year-old Gill is following in a rich lineage of Indian cricket batting greats.\nAnd this is where he doesn't quite live up to his lofty billing. His Test batting average of 35 lags behind Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rohit Sharma and Kohli at the same stage of their career.\nIn fact, it's significantly behind Dravid and Tendulkar, who were both averaging the widely accepted world-class mark of 50 by their 32nd Test.\nBut while Tendulkar - the most prolific international batter of all time -, external was just 16 when he made his Test debut, Gill was younger than both Kohli and Dravid when given his chance in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG in 2020.\nThe signs were good for Gill when he averaged almost 52 in three Tests in Australia as India lifted the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\nDips in form and an injury in England in the summer of 2021 followed, but Gill's trajectory was heading only one way.\nHis first Test century came in Bangladesh in 2022, before a career-best 128 against Australia in Ahmedabad in 2023 preceded two centuries against England on their tour of India in early 2024.\n\"There was a phase where I got 40s or 50s,\" said Gill, speaking in 2023. \"So I felt that I was being overly defensive after getting set. That isn't my game. When I get set, I catch my rhythm.\n\"I'd rather accept being dismissed while going for a shot. It wasn't acceptable to me that I got out while trying to adapt to a style which didn't come naturally to me. All of my dismissals in this period were off defensive shots.\"\nSo has Gill been more positive in recent years?\nYes: in short, he's playing more attacking shots and leaving the ball less.\nKohli, in particular, was desperate to do well in England after previous failures and Gill will surely be no different.\nCuriously, he has played three Tests in England against three different opponents.\nThat happened by virtue of appearing in India's two World Test Championship final appearances against New Zealand and Australia, plus one Test against England in 2022.\nA top score of 28 in six innings will surely be improved upon this summer, but England will be more than aware that four of Gill's dismissals in the UK have been either caught behind by the keeper or in the slip cordon.\nWhat is interesting about Gill is how significantly better he is against spin (averaging 42) compared to pace (31).\nDespite this, however, he is not a prolific sweeper. When he does use that shot he strikes at 212 per 100 balls.\nHe loves to latch on to anything short, striking at 190 on the pull shot which has brought him 29 fours and three sixes in Test cricket for the price of just one dismissal.\nThe shot which has brought him the most runs is the drive, but his strength is also a weakness, with that accounting for five dismissals.\nPerhaps typical of any opener, some 21 of his dismissals in Test cricket have come playing a forward defensive shot. This is another reason why England will be packing the slip cordon with the new ball.\nInterestingly, he averages 40 against fast bowling of 87mph upwards and 22 against the slower seam bowlers.\nThe retired James Anderson has got him out more than anyone else in Test cricket, while Gill has also struggled against Australia's Scott Boland.\nCould Chris Woakes be England's man to make the opposition captain his bunny this summer?\nThis graphic shows Shubman Gill's interception points when being dismissed playing a forward defensive shot. England will surely try to get the India skipper playing this shot while reaching in front of himself\nGill has some leadership experience, having captained India in five T20 internationals and taking charge of Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League.\nGujarat finished third in the 2025 IPL, having been eighth the year before - Gill's first in charge. He has a win percentage of 52%, which is nothing spectacular compared to Hardik Pandya's 71% in more games in charge of the Titans.\nAustralia great Ricky Ponting believes \"leadership sits really well\" with Gill, while the player himself says he is embracing the challenge.\nIf his desire to be more positive with the bat sounds very similar to the mantra within the England camp - Gill played under England head coach Brendon McCullum in the IPL - so is his leadership philosophy.\n\"What I like is communication with the players, making the players feel secure, talking to them, giving them comfort around their weaknesses and strengths,\" Gill said when unveiled as skipper.\n\"If you are a captain of any team or a leader of any team, if your players feel very secure, only then they can give their 100%.\"\nWhat is for sure is that he will be more Kohli than Rohit in the field.\nNever one to take a backward step, Gill sledged James Anderson and Jonny Bairstow in a Test in India, while umpires have felt his presence when in charge at the IPL.\nIndia's 'Prince' may have chiselled, film star-like good looks, but he will be prepared to fight if the crown slips.\nEngland vs India Series Preview\nFrom prodigy to leader: Can Shubman Gill shape the future of Indian Test cricket?\nKohli & Rohit showed blueprint for future - Gill",

        "article_text": "For centuries, the people of Odisha have turned to pakhala \u2013 a fermented rice dish \u2013 to beat the heat. Now it's gaining global attention.\nIt was a scorching hot day in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha in eastern India. As the temperature soared, my university friends and I rushed to the cafeteria for the meal we looked forward to most in summer: a bowl of pakhala (water rice). Light and tangy, the dish gave us immediate relief from the oppressive heat. Two decades later, as I sit in my apartment in the dry heat of Riyadh, it remains my go-to comfort food in summer, especially after a long day in the sun.\u00a0\nPakhala is Odisha's unique summertime ritual. Also known as \"poor man's gruel\", the simple dish is made from leftover cooked rice soaked in water and fermented overnight in an earthen pot. It is usually mixed with yoghurt, tempered with mustard seeds, dried red chillies and curry leaves and served with a variety of sides such as mashed potatoes, saut\u00e9ed green leafy vegetables and fried fish.\nOdias (people of Odisha) have consumed pakhala since ancient times since it's affordable and easy to prepare, yet nutritionally rich. \"The earliest documented use of pakhala dates back to the 12th Century, when the dish was offered to Lord Jagannath (a Hindu deity worshipped in Odisha) at the Jagannath Temple in Puri,\" says Ritu Pattanaik, food historian and the author of the cookbook 259 Inherited Recipes of Odisha. \"Even today, pakhala is one of the best foods to have when temperatures rise.\"\nOdisha has always been an agrarian society, and rice is a staple. \"In the olden days, it was typical for women in the house to add water to leftover rice from lunch. There was no refrigerator at the time, so this prevented the rice from spoiling. In the morning, men ate this fermented rice and water before heading out to work in the fields. Pakhala gave them energy and helped them beat the afternoon heat.\"\nCentral to pakhala's benefits is the slightly sour, probiotic-rich fermented water known as torani, which hydrates and protects the body against heat stroke. Once water and rice have undergone fermentation, torani becomes a\u00a0rich source of lactic acid bacteria, which protect the stomach and intestines from infection and aid digestion.\n\"However, the benefits of torani don't end there,\" adds Dr Balamurugan Ramadass, professor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Bhubaneswar. \"In addition to probiotics, torani is a rich source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains vitamin K, which [helps] heals wounds faster.\"\nHe notes that torani delivers instant energy to an exhausted body, \"which is why farmers consume one to two litres of it before going to work every day. An average person with a desk job can have two to three cups of torani daily and still benefit from this healing beverage.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo trusted are torani's health benefits that India's\u00a0National Disaster Management Authority advises people to drink it during heatwaves. In a country where extended summer heatwaves are becoming the norm, drinks like torani are increasingly seen as functional superfoods that both cool and nourish the body.\u00a0\n\"One of the simplest ways to increase your torani intake is to consume pakhala instead of plain rice or bread for lunch,\" says chef Abinas Nayak, winner of MasterChef India Season 6. He notes that pakhala is straightforward to prepare. \"Take leftover cooked rice, pour water over it and leave it in an earthen pot to ferment overnight. Pakhala will be ready in the morning.\"\nBecause of the humble ingredients and simple cooking method, a bowl of pakhala costs less than a dollar to buy \u2013 and significantly less to prepare at home. \"In some ways, pakhala is the great equaliser in our society. It's accessible to and loved by everyone, regardless of class, income or background,\" says Nayak.\nPakhala is deeply ingrained in Odisha's sociocultural fabric. It is common to eat a bowl before each new beginning, be it a new job, house or relationship. \"At the end of every Odia wedding, the bride's mother feeds pakhala to her newlywed daughter and son-in-law to ensure that the marriage runs smoothly,\" says Pattanaik. Flask back to 2009 and my own wedding rituals: the fact that I had two pakhala kansas (bronze bowls) in my bridal trousseau suddenly makes sense. \"Yes, your mother put those bowls to make sure your relationship with your husband was cool like pakhala,\" Pattanaik adds with a smile.\nFor many Odias, pakhala is a nostalgic trip back to childhood. \"In summertime, my mother would always have a bowl of pakhala and some mashed potatoes waiting for me when I got home from school,\" Nayak reminisces. \"That was the meal I always cherished and still do now. It is the taste of home and comfort for me.\"\nWhere to try it:\nTraditional Odia restaurants, such as Kaka Hotel and Odisha Hotel in Bhubaneswar, Odisha Bhavan in Mumbai and Dalma in Bengaluru offer hearty bowls of pakhala with delicious sides. This dish is traditionally eaten with your hand \u2013 one scoop of water rice followed by a bit of any side \u2013 though you can use a spoon if you prefer. Don't forget to drink the tangy torani after your meal.\nThough once considered too basic or old-fashioned to feature on modern menus, pakhala is enjoying a revival. With the mercury rising year after year and Indians becoming more receptive to native foods, pakhala is becoming increasingly popular, especially during the hot spells of April and May. Every year, the pakhala craze begins in early March peaks on Pakhala Dibasa (Pakhala Day) on 20 March and continues until the last monsoon arrives in mid-June. This is when restaurants across Odisha begin serving elaborate pakhala platters with a variety of sides.\u00a0\nThe trend is spreading across India and the world, with home cooks and food bloggers regularly sharing pakhala images and videos on social media, and cooking contests featuring inventive twists on the dish. Pakhala gatherings have become commonplace across the globe, including the US, UK and the Middle East, where Odias like me congregate to savour this nostalgic meal that's inextricably linked to our identity. Nayak has helped popularise the dish on social media and by preparing sumptuous pakhala platters at national events.\n\"By promoting Indigenous foods like pakhala, we are not only tapping into our rich culinary history but also rediscovering lost superfoods,\" he says. \"People are now seeing value in how our forefathers ate and that makes me happy.\"\nRestaurants are capitalising on this growing trend by offering elaborate pakhala platters with side dishes such as alu bharta (spiced mashed potatoes), baigana bharta (mashed aubergine), tomato poda (smoked tomato), sukhua (dried salted fish), saga bhaja (sauteed greens) and badi chura (crushed sundried lentil dumplings served with a dash of mustard oil and garlic).\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A local chef's favourite street food picks in Kolkata\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0Everyday Healing Broth: A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"These sides, however, are more than just add-ons; they are carefully selected for nutritional balance and texture.

        "article_text": "India's Smriti Mandhana is the number one ranked batter in ODIs, with Nat Sciver-Brunt third\nEngland's new era under head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt started with a ruthless clean sweep against the West Indies, but their first real challenge begins on Saturday, with the first of five T20s against India taking place at Trent Bridge. \nThey are followed by three one-day internationals, which will be hugely important in preparation for the World Cup which is being hosted by India in the autumn. \nSuch is the anticipation for the series, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) commissioned 'Bend it Like Beckham' director Gurinder Chadha to direct a promotional trailer for the ongoing men's, women's and mixed disability series in which India face England in all three.\nIndia are ranked third in the world in both white-ball formats with England in second, and the introduction of the Women's Premier League (WPL) has significantly improved their strength in depth and experience of playing in front of packed crowds under pressure. \nBBC Sport looks at the players to watch and the storylines to keep an eye out for.\nSciver-Brunt and India batter Smriti Mandhana are two of the game's biggest icons - at the first auction for the WPL in 2023, the England all-rounder sold for about \u00a3320,000 and the elegant India left-hander was the most expensive pick at \u00a3340,000.\nMandhana is the world's top-ranked batter in ODIs with Sciver-Brunt in third, while they are fourth and ninth in T20s respectively. \nTheir individual successes could go a long way in defining the series. England win 79% of their ODIs if Sciver-Brunt passes 50, and that figure rises to 82% in T20s.\nIndia rely a little more on Mandhana in the longer format with a win percentage of 76% if she scores a half-century, compared to 60% in T20s. \nIn general, India are likely to present a bigger challenge to England with the bat as their bowling looks depleted without the experience and prolific swing of the injured Renuka Singh Thakur.\nIn their warm-ups, they have conceded 353-5 to England's Select XI in a 50-over match and 194-8 in the T20, eventually losing both.\nMandhana, named Wisden's leading women's cricketer in the world for 2024, has an excellent record against England, averaging 51.68 in ODIs and a fraction over 38 in T20s, but there are areas of weakness for the bowlers to target.\nIn T20s, England's seamers should target Mandhana on the stumps early in her innings with movement into the left-hander - she averages 23 against in-swing compared to 40 against balls that swing away from her. \nCharlie Dean and Alice Capsey should also take note as off-spin is the best match-up to Mandhana. Since 2022, she averages 24 with a strike-rate of 108 - her lowest average and strike-rate against any type of bowling. \nSophie Ecclestone took 4-12 as Lancashire won the T20 Women's County Cup final\nThe return of Ecclestone, the world's number one bowler in ODIs and ranked fourth in T20s, has dominated the build-up to the series as she returns to the England fold for the first time since the Ashes. \nThe left-arm spinner made headlines for her off-field behaviour in Australia when she refused a TV interview with former team-mate turned pundit Alex Hartley, who had criticised the team's fitness after the T20 World Cup.\nShe was then left out of Edwards' first squads for the West Indies series, having missed the start of Lancashire's season with a knee injury. England insisted her absence was due to a lack of game time and to recover from the niggle, though Ecclestone played for her county on the same day the squad was announced.\nIt was confirmed at the beginning of this month that Ecclestone would take a break from county cricket to \"prioritise her wellbeing\" and to manage a quad problem, before Edwards named her in the squad to face India. \n\"This is the best preparation for Sophie, to be ready for India,\" Edwards said after the final ODI against West Indies, when asked about her previous statements that she wanted to pick players based on form in domestic cricket. \n\"She has been playing, she has performed really well, including winning the T20 Cup with Lancashire, so I'm happy with how she is tracking.\" \nDespite a difficult period for England, Ecclestone's numbers have never dropped - in 2024 she took 24 wickets in T20s, averaging 14.87 with an economy rate of just 5.59, and 13 scalps in ODIs at a remarkable average of 7.23.\nBut with fellow left-armer Smith impressing against West Indies, including a five-for on ODI debut - alongside Edwards' insistence that nobody's place in the side is guaranteed - it is unlikely Ecclestone has ever been under pressure like this before.\nOne of England's most significant weaknesses over the past couple of years has been their ability against spin, and an apparent lack of strategy against it. \nThough West Indies' bowling line-up was unthreatening and England's batters dominated throughout, there were some suggestions this is still a concern and will be tested both in this upcoming series, and more significantly in the World Cup where conditions will suit the spinners.\nIn the T20s, West Indies opened with Zaida James' spin and she removed Danni Wyatt-Hodge twice with the first ball of the match, while Hayley Matthews took 3-32 in the third T20 and 2-49 in the first ODI. \nThough England drew the 2023 Ashes at home, 23 wickets fell to off-spinner Ash Gardner and a surprise T20 series defeat by Sri Lanka followed as the tourists wisely packed their side with slow bowlers. \nLeg-spinner Alana King then matched Gardner's tally at the start of this year as England lost 40 wickets to spin in the series at an average of just 12.3. \nThere is no doubt India will be aware of this and it works to their advantage, too - since 2023, 58% of their deliveries bowled in both white-ball formats have been from spinners, and they have accounted for 62% of their wickets in T20s and 65% in ODIs.\nDeepti Sharma's run out of Charlie Dean sealed a 3-0 ODI series win for India in 2022\nIndia's last tour of England in 2022 saw the visitors claim a 3-0 clean sweep in the ODIs, with Sciver-Brunt and then-captain Heather Knight's absences sorely felt, but it was the final act of the series at Lord's which saw it end in controversy. \nIn a thrilling finale, England needed 17 runs to win while India required just one wicket when spinner Deepti Sharma ran out Dean on 47 at the non-striker's end - often referred to as a 'Mankad'. \nDean was in tears, stand-in captain Amy Jones said she was \"not a fan\" while India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur backed her bowler. \nDean jokingly re-enacted the dismissal in a game for Southern Vipers the following day and the pair have since played together for London Spirit, winning The Hundred last year.\nBut at Lord's on 19 July, their reunion will inevitably take the spotlight. \n\"It's in the laws, it happens, so unless the laws change and become a little bit more obvious in terms of what counts and what doesn't, then it's going to keep happening,\" said England batter Tammy Beaumont. \n\"We have to get on board with that unfortunately. I'm sure externally there will be plenty of replays but we'll be keeping our bats behind the line for sure.\n\"We'll play in a competitive spirit as we always do against India, but definitely we will be respectful to all their players too.\"\nFollow ball by ball commentary of every match of India's tour of England on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app. TV highlights will be available on iPlayer and the Red Button.",

        "article_text": "Is the \"big, beautiful\" India-US trade deal slipping out of reach?\nWith just days to go before a 9 July deadline set by US President Donald Trump's administration, hopes of clinching an interim trade pact between Delhi and Washington remain alive but increasingly entangled in hard bargaining.\nDespite White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt hinting that the deal was imminent, and Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's upbeat assertion that Delhi would welcome \"a big, good, beautiful\" agreement - in response to Trump's claim that a trade deal with Delhi is coming and would \"open up\" the Indian market - negotiators remain locked in tough discussions. \nKey sticking points persist, particularly over agricultural access, auto components and tariffs on Indian steel.\nIndian trade officials have extended their stay in Washington for another round of talks, even as Delhi signals \"very big red lines\" on farm and dairy protections, and the US presses for wider market openings. The tone remains optimistic - but the window to strike a deal appears to be narrowing.\n\"The next seven days could determine whether India and the US settle for a limited 'mini-deal' or walk away from the negotiating table  - at least for now,\" says Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who runs Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\nThat uncertainty hinges on a few key flashpoints - none more contentious than agriculture.\n\"There are two real challenges to concluding an initial agreement. First on the list is US access to the Indian market for basic agriculture products. India will need to protect its basic agriculture sector for economic and political reasons,\" Richard Rossow, who tracks India's economy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\nMr Rossow says the \"second issue is India's non-tariff barriers. Issues like India's growing set of 'Quality Control Orders' (QCO) are significant obstacles to US market access and may prove tricky to meaningfully handle in a trade deal\".\nThe US has raised concerns over what it calls India's growing and burdensome import-quality rules. Over 700 QCOs - part of the \"self-reliant India\" push - aim to curb low-quality imports and promote domestic manufacturing. Suman Berry, a senior member of a government think tank Niti Aayog, has also called these rules a \"malign intervention\" that restrict imports and raise costs for domestic medium and small scale industries.\nThe elephant in the room is farm exports. India-US farm trade remains modest at $8bn, with India exporting rice, shrimp and spices, and the US sending nuts, apples and lentils. But as trade talks progress, Washington is eyeing bigger farm exports -  maize, soya bean, cotton and corn - to help narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.\nExperts fear tariff concessions could pressure India to weaken its minimum support prices (MSP) and public procurement - key protections that shield farmers from price crashes by guaranteeing fair prices and stable crop purchases.\n\"No tariff cuts are expected for dairy products or key food grains like rice and wheat, where farm livelihoods are at stake. These categories are politically and economically sensitive, affecting over 700 million people in India's rural economy,\" says Mr Srivastava.\nCuriously, a recent Niti Aayog paper recommends tariff cuts on US farm imports -  including rice, dairy, poultry, corn, apples, almonds and GM soya - under a proposed India-US trade pact. It's unclear, however, whether the proposal reflects official government thinking or remains a policy suggestion on paper.\n\"If the US were to say 'no deal' if India does not include access on basic agriculture, then clearly American expectations were not set correctly. Any democratically-elected government will have political limits to commercial policy choices,\" says Mr Rossow.\nSo what could happen with the deal now?\nExperts like Mr Srivastava believe that the \"more likely outcome is a limited trade pact\" - styled after the US-UK mini trade deal announced on 8 May.\nUnder the proposed deal, India may cut tariffs on a range of industrial goods - including automobiles, a long-standing US demand - and offer limited agricultural access via tariff cuts and quotas on select products like ethanol, almonds, walnuts, apples, raisins, avocados, olive oil, spirits and wine.\nBeyond tariff cuts, the US is likely to push India for large-scale commercial buys -  from oil and LNG to Boeing aircraft, helicopters and nuclear reactors. Washington may also seek FDI easing in multi-brand retail, benefiting firms like Amazon and Walmart, and relaxed rules on re-manufactured goods.\n\"This 'mini-deal', if concluded, would therefore focus on tariff reductions and strategic commitments, leaving broader FTA issues - including services trade, intellectual property (IP) rights and digital regulations - for a future negotiation,\"  says Mr Srivastava.\nAt the start, the India-US trade talks appeared to be grounded in a clear and fair vision.\n\"The two leaders [Trump and Modi] laid out a simple concept in their first summit this year. The US would focus on manufactured goods that are capital-intensive, while India would focus on items that are labour-intensive,\" says Mr Rossow. But things appear to have changed since.\nIf talks collapse, experts believe Trump is unlikely to reinstate the steep 26% tariff rate on India. Instead, a 10% baseline tariff may apply to most Indian imports, on top of existing MFN rates (MFN or Most Favoured Nation rate is the lowest tariff rate that a World Trade Organisation member country levies on another WTO member).\nWhile 57 countries faced these levies in April, only the UK has secured a deal so far. Targeting India specifically could seem unfair. \"Still, with Trump, surprises can't be ruled out,\" says Mr Srivastava.",

        "article_text": "Is the \"big, beautiful\" India-US trade deal slipping out of reach?\nWith just days to go before a 9 July deadline set by US President Donald Trump's administration, hopes of clinching an interim trade pact between Delhi and Washington remain alive but increasingly entangled in hard bargaining.\nDespite White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt hinting that the deal was imminent, and Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's upbeat assertion that Delhi would welcome \"a big, good, beautiful\" agreement - in response to Trump's claim that a trade deal with Delhi is coming and would \"open up\" the Indian market - negotiators remain locked in tough discussions. \nKey sticking points persist, particularly over agricultural access, auto components and tariffs on Indian steel.\nIndian trade officials have extended their stay in Washington for another round of talks, even as Delhi signals \"very big red lines\" on farm and dairy protections, and the US presses for wider market openings. The tone remains optimistic - but the window to strike a deal appears to be narrowing.\n\"The next seven days could determine whether India and the US settle for a limited 'mini-deal' or walk away from the negotiating table  - at least for now,\" says Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official who runs Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\nThat uncertainty hinges on a few key flashpoints - none more contentious than agriculture.\n\"There are two real challenges to concluding an initial agreement. First on the list is US access to the Indian market for basic agriculture products. India will need to protect its basic agriculture sector for economic and political reasons,\" Richard Rossow, who tracks India's economy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\nMr Rossow says the \"second issue is India's non-tariff barriers. Issues like India's growing set of 'Quality Control Orders' (QCO) are significant obstacles to US market access and may prove tricky to meaningfully handle in a trade deal\".\nThe US has raised concerns over what it calls India's growing and burdensome import-quality rules. Over 700 QCOs - part of the \"self-reliant India\" push - aim to curb low-quality imports and promote domestic manufacturing. Suman Berry, a senior member of a government think tank Niti Aayog, has also called these rules a \"malign intervention\" that restrict imports and raise costs for domestic medium and small scale industries.\nThe elephant in the room is farm exports. India-US farm trade remains modest at $8bn, with India exporting rice, shrimp and spices, and the US sending nuts, apples and lentils. But as trade talks progress, Washington is eyeing bigger farm exports -  maize, soya bean, cotton and corn - to help narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.\nExperts fear tariff concessions could pressure India to weaken its minimum support prices (MSP) and public procurement - key protections that shield farmers from price crashes by guaranteeing fair prices and stable crop purchases.\n\"No tariff cuts are expected for dairy products or key food grains like rice and wheat, where farm livelihoods are at stake. These categories are politically and economically sensitive, affecting over 700 million people in India's rural economy,\" says Mr Srivastava.\nCuriously, a recent Niti Aayog paper recommends tariff cuts on US farm imports -  including rice, dairy, poultry, corn, apples, almonds and GM soya - under a proposed India-US trade pact. It's unclear, however, whether the proposal reflects official government thinking or remains a policy suggestion on paper.\n\"If the US were to say 'no deal' if India does not include access on basic agriculture, then clearly American expectations were not set correctly. Any democratically-elected government will have political limits to commercial policy choices,\" says Mr Rossow.\nSo what could happen with the deal now?\nExperts like Mr Srivastava believe that the \"more likely outcome is a limited trade pact\" - styled after the US-UK mini trade deal announced on 8 May.\nUnder the proposed deal, India may cut tariffs on a range of industrial goods - including automobiles, a long-standing US demand - and offer limited agricultural access via tariff cuts and quotas on select products like ethanol, almonds, walnuts, apples, raisins, avocados, olive oil, spirits and wine.\nBeyond tariff cuts, the US is likely to push India for large-scale commercial buys -  from oil and LNG to Boeing aircraft, helicopters and nuclear reactors. Washington may also seek FDI easing in multi-brand retail, benefiting firms like Amazon and Walmart, and relaxed rules on re-manufactured goods.\n\"This 'mini-deal', if concluded, would therefore focus on tariff reductions and strategic commitments, leaving broader FTA issues - including services trade, intellectual property (IP) rights and digital regulations - for a future negotiation,\"  says Mr Srivastava.\nAt the start, the India-US trade talks appeared to be grounded in a clear and fair vision.\n\"The two leaders [Trump and Modi] laid out a simple concept in their first summit this year. The US would focus on manufactured goods that are capital-intensive, while India would focus on items that are labour-intensive,\" says Mr Rossow. But things appear to have changed since.\nIf talks collapse, experts believe Trump is unlikely to reinstate the steep 26% tariff rate on India. Instead, a 10% baseline tariff may apply to most Indian imports, on top of existing MFN rates (MFN or Most Favoured Nation rate is the lowest tariff rate that a World Trade Organisation member country levies on another WTO member).\nWhile 57 countries faced these levies in April, only the UK has secured a deal so far. Targeting India specifically could seem unfair. \"Still, with Trump, surprises can't be ruled out,\" says Mr Srivastava.",

        "article_text": "\"Who is responsible for this mess?\"\nThe question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated.\nHeavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours. \nEven a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral. \nThe pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\nFollowing criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late.\nThe crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai.\nFrom Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt.\nExperts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem. \n\"The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,\" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi.\n\"Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,\" he adds.\nExperts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses.\nIndia receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September.\nThe monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent.\nBut experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people.\nThis year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared. \n\"A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,\" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. \nIn Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding.\nThis year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department. \nMany residents reported damage to their property. \nAt least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports.\nMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same. \nOnce known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding.\n\"Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,\" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist.\nThese valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says. \n\"When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.\" \nMr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made.\nViolations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides.\nBut experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain.\n\"The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,\" Mr Kukerja says. \"Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience.\"\nThis isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more. \nOver the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way. \nSo, can anything be done to prevent this?\n\"Yes,\" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy.\nHe suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses.\n\"But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,\" he said.\nFor India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Which is what makes this transition so interesting,\" says Dr Sushma Jansari, the exhibition's curator.\nThe exhibition explores both the continuity and change in India's sacred art through five sections, starting with the nature spirits, followed by sub-sections dedicated to each of the three religions, and concluding with the spread of the faiths and their art beyond India to other parts of the world like Cambodia and China.\nThe centrepiece of the Buddhist section of the exhibition \u2013 a striking two-sided sandstone panel that shows the evolution of the Buddha - is perhaps the most distinguishable in depicting this great transition.\nOne side, carved in about AD250, reveals the Buddha in human form with intricate embellishments, while on the other - carved earlier in about 50-1BC - he's represented symbolically through a tree, an empty throne and footprints.\nThe sculpture - from a sacred shrine in Amaravati (in India's south-east) - was once part of the decorative circular base of a stupa, or a Buddhist monument.  \nTo have this transformation showcased on \"one single panel from one single shrine is quite extraordinary\", says Dr Jansari.\nIn the Hindu section, another early bronze statue reflects the gradual evolution of sacred visual imagery through the depiction of goddesses. \nThe figure resembles a yakshi - a powerful primordial nature spirit that can bestow both \"abundance and fertility, as well as death and disease\" - recognisable through her floral headdress, jewellery and full figure.\nBut it also incorporates multiple arms holding specific sacred objects which became characteristic of how Hindu female deities were represented in later centuries.\nOn display also are captivating examples of Jain religious art, which largely focus on its 24 enlightened teachers called tirthankaras. \nThe earliest such representations were found on a mottled pink sandstone dating back about 2,000 years and began to be recognised through the sacred symbol of an endless knot on the teachers' chest. \nThe sculptures commissioned across these religions were often made in common workshops in the ancient city of Mathura which the curators say explains why there are marked similarities between them.\nUnlike other shows on South Asia, the exhibition is unique because it is the \"first ever\" look at the origins of all three religious artistic traditions together, rather than separately, says Dr Jansari.\nIn addition, it carefully calls attention to the provenance of every object on display, with brief explanations on the object's journey through various hands, its acquisition by museums and so on.\nThe show highlights intriguing detail such as the fact that many of the donors of Buddhist art in particular were women. But it fails to answer why the material transformation in the visual language took place.\n\"That remains a million-dollar question. Scholars are still debating this,\" says Dr Jansari. \"Unless more evidence comes through, we aren't going to know. But the extraordinary flourishing of figurative art tells us that people really took to the idea of imagining the divine as human.\"\nThe show is a multi-sensory experience - with scents, drapes, nature sounds, and vibrant colours designed to evoke the atmospherics of active Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious shrines.\n\"There's so much going on in these sacred spaces, and yet there's an innate calm and serenity. I wanted to bring that out,\" says Dr Jansari, who collaborated with several designers, artists and community partners to put it together. \nPunctuating the displays are screens displaying short films of practising worshipers from each of the religions in Britain. These underscore the point that this isn't just about \"ancient art but also living tradition\" that's continuously relevant to millions of people in the UK and other parts of the globe, far beyond modern India's borders.\nThe exhibition draws from the British Museum's South Asian collection with 37 loans from private lenders and national and international museums and libraries in the UK, Europe and India. \nAncient India: Living Traditions is showing at the British Museum, London, from 22 May to 19 October. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "After years of border tensions, India and China appear to be gradually moving towards resetting ties - but larger challenges and suspicions remain.\nThe visit of two senior Indian officials to China late last month was seen as a sign of a thaw in bilateral relations.\nIn June, Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also made separate visits as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings. \nThe SCO is a 10-member Eurasian security grouping that also includes China, Russia, Iran and Pakistan. Singh's visit was the first by a senior Indian official to China in five years.\nAt the heart of India-China tensions is an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long disputed border. Rivers, lakes and snow-caps along the frontier mean the line often shifts, bringing soldiers face to face at many points, sometimes sparking skirmishes. \nThe crisis escalated in June 2020 when the two forces clashed in the Galwan valley in Ladakh in what was the first fatal confrontation between them since 1975. At least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. Stand-offs between the militaries have since taken place in several places.\nBut geopolitical uncertainty and ground realities appear to have nudged the two sides to find common ground on several issues. \nLate last year, they reached an agreement on the main friction points in Ladakh. \nIn January, Delhi and Beijing agreed to restore direct flights and relax visa curbs that were imposed after the 2020 clash. \nThe same month, Indian pilgrims were allowed to visit a sacred mountain, the Kailash, and a holy lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region after a gap of six years.\nBut experts point out there are other hurdles. \nFor India, China is the second-largest trading partner with bilateral trade reaching more than $127bn (\u00a393.4bn) last year. It relies heavily on Chinese imports, particularly rare earth minerals. \nPeace in border areas, therefore, is essential to boost economic ties. \nWith its increasing focus on Taiwan, Beijing also wants peace in its Himalayan border with India - for now. \nBut at a strategic level, China suspects that Western nations are using India to counterbalance its rise and growing influence. \nSo, in addition to solving the border dispute, Beijing would want improvements in other areas as well, as it hopes to counter Delh's increasing dependence on the US and its allies for security. \nThis includes more Chinese exports; increasing investments in India, and the removal of visa restrictions for Chinese engineers and workers. (India had banned dozens of Chinese apps and imposed restrictions on Chinese investments in the aftermath of the 2020 clash, citing security concerns). \nFast-changing geopolitics - particularly in the US since President Trump assumed a second term in power - has also compelled Delhi to reach out to China, experts say. \n\"India thought it would be a very close strategic ally [of the US] but they were not getting the support they were expecting from Washington,\" Professor Christopher Clary of University of Albany in New York tells the BBC.\nDuring recent border tensions with arch-rival Pakistan in May, Delhi also witnessed the growing military co-operation between Beijing and Islamabad. Pakistan used Chinese made fighter jets, air defence systems and air-to-air missiles in the four-day conflict.\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, Trump repeatedly asserted that he had mediated between the two sides for a ceasefire.\nThis embarrassed Delhi which insists that it directly spoke with Pakistani officials to stop the fighting, and vehemently denies any third-party mediation.\nWeeks later, Trump also hosted Pakistani army chief Asim Munir for lunch at the White House, much to the dismay of Delhi. \nAt the same time, the US and India are also engaged in frantic talks to reach a trade agreement. Trump has already threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, if a deal is not reached by 1 August .\n\"Given President Trump's statements about the mediation between India and Pakistan and about the trade talks, there's a feeling in Delhi that this is the time to reach out to countries like China,\" Clary says.\nStrategic experts argue that Washington views Delhi as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But given the US president's unpredictability, there are now doubts in Delhi about how far the US will go to support India in any future conflict with China.\nThe Quadrilateral Security Dialogue \u2013 known as the Quad \u2013 involving the US, Japan, Australia and India has taken a back seat during the Trump administration's second term. \n\"In recent years, China has also significantly increased its influence in other multilateral organisations like the SCO and the Brics grouping of emerging economies,\" says Phunchok Stobdan, a former senior Indian diplomat.\nSo, India is taking a pragmatic approach, he says. \n\"At the same time, it does not want to be seen yielding too much to the Chinese demands for domestic reasons,\" he adds. \nAnd it's not just the US - India is also keenly watching how its long-time ally and major weapons supplier Russia leaned towards Beijing due to the war with Ukraine.\nWestern sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased Moscow's reliance on China for energy exports. \nMoscow also depends on Beijing for critical imports and investments, all of which has made Delhi wary of the Kremlin's position in any future confrontation with China. \nChina is also using its industrial might to squeeze many nations that depend on its imports - and countries like India feel the restrictions might impact their economic growth.\n\"China has lately been utilising trade as a weapon against India, suspending crucial exports such as rare earth magnets and fertilisers. These actions could affect India's manufacturing and agricultural sectors,\" Mr Stobdan says.\nRare earth magnets are especially crucial for automobile, home appliance and clean energy sectors. China imposed restrictions on its imports starting from April, requiring companies to obtain permits. \nAn Indian automobile industry association has warned that production could be severely impacted if the restrictions are not eased soon. Following these apprehensions, the Indian government said it was holding talks with Beijing.\nThough China is keen on boosting business, it hasn't shown any signs of compromise on its other territorial disputes with India.\nIn recent years, it has increasingly asserted its claim over the entire north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Southern Tibet.\nDelhi asserts that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country and points out that people of the state regularly vote in elections to choose their state government and there's no room for any compromise.\n\"If China and India would not abandon the concept of sovereignty, then they will continue to fight forever. If they can reach a deal on Southern Tibet [or Arunachal Pradesh], then the two countries would have eternal peace,\" Prof Shen Dingli from the Fudan University in Shanghai tells the BBC.\nFor now, both Delhi and Beijing are aware that their territorial dispute cannot be solved in the near future.\nThey seem willing to strike a working relationship that's mutually beneficial, and would want to avoid tensions altogether, rather than relying on any global power bloc for support.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

In-play video clips and text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer and BBC Two each night.\nThis is, in every sense, it.\nBazball. Pensioning off James Anderson. Ben Stokes' knee. Ben Stokes' hamstring. The Raid of Rawalpindi and the Heist of Hyderabad. One run in Wellington. The moral Ashes and enough rounds of golf to forge a major champion.\nAll leading to this.\nTen Tests - five against India now and five against Australia in the winter - the difference between this England team being remembered as ideological entertainers, glorious winners, or both.\nStokes, the captain, has a place in history assured. Further success between now and January would strengthen his claim as England's greatest cricketer of all time. Coach Brendon McCullum could quit today and still go down as the man that resuscitated the England team. Now he has the opportunity to take some of the biggest prizes back to his stables in New Zealand.\nThere is every chance both are still in charge this time next year \u2013 McCullum is contracted until 2027 anyway \u2013 but also an alternative outcome that sees the end of both. In the story arc we have reached the Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows, the finale of which will determine the appetite for a Cursed Child stage show.\nTalk of a \"defining period\" will not seep into the dressing room. Stokes famously told Jofra Archer \"today doesn't define you\" before he bowled the super over in the 2019 World Cup final. On a human level, how many of us would want to be judged on a six-month period at work?\n\"I don't tend to worry myself about what other people are going to say about what I've done as a captain at the end of it,\" said Stokes.\n\"Since I've done this role I've done it wholeheartedly and thrown everything I possibly have into doing it, both on the field and off the field. That's all I can really control. The results will be the results and hopefully we'll have more in favour than not.\"\nPope, Bumrah, Bashir - how England v India will be won and lost\n'Woakes return more important than ever to England'\nEngland dropping Pope would be 'remarkable' - Stokes\nStill, there is an inescapable truth that some parts of professional sport are more important than others. Some days, matches and series are bigger. The series against India, starting in sun-kissed Leeds on Friday, is bigger.\nIt is an English cricketing disease to look at everything in the context of the Ashes. Contests against Australia tend to cement legacies, shape futures and create the longest memories.\nThe best way for England to arrive in Perth in November in the strongest possible shape is to defeat India, though even framing it like that feels disrespectful to the biggest cricketing juggernaut on the planet.\nEngland and Australia may have a longer shared history, but India are in a league of their own in terms of power, attention and scrutiny. Their presence in this country over the next seven weeks, free of competing for oxygen with Premier League football, is a headline act in the sporting summer.\nEngland are a very good Test team, though probably not quite as good as they should be. They have won four and lost four of their past eight matches. Three of those defeats, by Sri Lanka at The Oval, Pakistan in Rawalpindi and New Zealand in Hamilton, were incredibly loose performances.\nIt is the sloppiness that frustrates supporters, made all the more infuriating by the knowledge of how good England can be at their best.\nRecent messaging - Stokes and McCullum talking about their team being \"smarter\" - suggests England have listened and learned. Time will tell.\nThis video can not be played\n'It would be remarkable to choose someone over Pope'\nIn terms of personnel, Ollie Pope v Jacob Bethell was the biggest conversation around an England number three since Ashley Cole left Arsenal for Chelsea. Stokes claimed it was never in doubt he would stick with Pope, so now Pope has to repay the faith.\nThe home side's fast bowling is down to the bare bones and a potential area of weakness in what could be superb batting conditions. Reinforcements are hopefully on the way. Gus Atkinson trained on Wednesday and Archer is set to play for Sussex on Sunday, the latest stage in England's yearn for his return like Vladimir and Estragon waiting for Godot.\nTypically, the spotlight may again fall on Stokes. For all of the effort the all-rounder has put into being fit to bowl, England probably need his runs more than his overs.\nStokes has not made a Test hundred since the near-miracle against Australia at Lord's in 2023, averaging below 30 in the process. He has batted only once in any kind of professional cricket in seven months. Headingley, for obvious reasons, might be the place to spark inspiration.\nHow does new captain Gill compare to India batting greats?\nWin in England bigger than IPL - India captain Gill \nNair's long road back to India team, via Northampton\nFor once, Stokes is not the biggest box-office draw. India's Jasprit Bumrah is the leading cricketer on the planet right now, compiling a career that will stack up against any fast bowler to have played the game. How England survive his staccato approach and educated fingers will go a long way to deciding the series.\nEvery spell from Bumrah \u2013 and he may only play three Tests \u2013 will be must-watch, just like the middle-order pyrotechnics of India wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. England spinner Shoaib Bashir will have to hold his nerve when Pant attempts to hit him out of Yorkshire.\nBumrah and Pant are familiar faces in an unfamiliar India side, led for the first time by Shubman Gill. After the retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin, India are evolving, albeit with no shortage of talent from their vast reserves.\nThe absence of Kohli in particular means there is a little less stardust, though not necessarily a diminished chance of India success. Kohli's returns in Test cricket had gradually dropped up to his retirement last month and the jury is out on whether India are weaker without him. They never won a series in this country with him in the team.\nIt is that difficulty for visiting teams to win here \u2013 India have not done so since 2007 \u2013 that has England starting as favourites to complete the first part of what would be an epic double.\nFor all of the highs of the Stokes-McCullum regime \u2013 and there have been plenty \u2013 they are still to tick off victory in a marquee five-Test series.\nA comparison can be made to a decade ago, when England last held simultaneous sway over India and Australia. Back then, their cricket under coach Andy Flower was notoriously dry, the dressing room mentality rarely shifting from siege. Yet, they were winners.\nThis England team can have it all. The entertainment, the glory, even the golf.\nFor the Old Trafford rain and Stuart Broad's bails. For Jonny Bairstow's runs and Jonny Bairstow's broken leg. For Moeen Ali's finger and Ollie Robinson's podcast. For Dan Lawrence opening the batting and 823-7 in Multan. For Joe Root's records and Mark Wood's rockets.

        "article_text": "Not much about Sneh Bhargava's life seems ordinary.\nIn 1984, she became the first woman to helm the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the capital Delhi - one of the country's top medical institutions - and in its almost 70-year history, remains the only woman to have done so.\nAt 90, Dr Bhargava - one of India's pioneering radiologists - began writing her memoir, The Woman Who Ran AIIMS, which was published earlier this month, and at 95, continues to remain an active member in the medical community.\nFrom choosing radiology when it was still emerging in 1940s India to becoming one of its most well-known practitioners, Dr Bhargava's legacy is nothing short of extraordinary.\nNot unlike her first day on the job as director-to-be of AIIMS, which was nothing short of a trial by fire.\nIt was the morning of 31 October 1984, and a meeting was under way at the hospital to confirm her appointment after India's then prime minister Indira Gandhi had selected her for the role.\nDr Bhargava was not part of the meeting, but was in her office reviewing medical cases for the day. She recalls in her memoir hearing a colleague frantically call out to her, asking her to rush to the casualty ward.\nThere, lying on a gurney was the very woman who had selected Dr Bhargava to head the hospital - Indira Gandhi. Her saffron sari was drenched in blood and she had no pulse.\n\"At the time, I didn't focus on it being the prime minister who was lying in front of me,\" Dr Bhargava told the BBC. \"My first thoughts were that we had to help her and also protect her from further harm,\" she said.\nDr Bhargava was worried that a mob would storm the casualty ward, as a large crowd had already begun gathering outside the hospital. \nNews began to trickle out: Gandhi had been shot by two Sikh bodyguards in revenge for Operation Blue Star, the military raid on Amritsar's Golden Temple in June to flush out militants.\nGandhi's assassination sparked one of the deadliest riots India has seen, the beginnings of which Dr Bhargava began hearing about as she hastened to shift the prime minister to one of the building's top floors.\nThere, in the operating theatre, a Sikh doctor fled the room the minute he heard how Gandhi had died.\nThe news of her death had to be kept under wraps until her son, Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as prime minister.\n\"Until then, our job, for the next four hours, was to keep up the charade that we were trying to save her life, when in fact she was dead when she was brought to AIIMS,\" Dr Bhargava writes.\nShe also described the harrowing process of embalming the prime minister's body, which would lie in state in the capital for two days before cremation.\n\"The embalming chemical, when we injected it into different main arteries, kept oozing out,\" Dr Bhargava writes. A ballistic report would later reveal that over three dozen bullets had punctured Gandhi's body.\nBut this wasn't the only remarkable episode in Dr Bhargava's long and illustrious career at AIIMS.\nIn the book she shares fascinating anecdotes of her interactions with other prominent politicians, including India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\nShe also recalls Sonia Gandhi bringing her son, a young Rahul to AIIMS after an arrow grazed his head while he was playing.\n\"Sonia Gandhi told me that she had to bring Rahul to us because Rajiv (her husband) was meeting the King of Jordan and the latter had given him a fancy car as a gift, which her husband was keen to drive,\" she writes in the book.\nRajiv Gandhi wanted to drive Rahul to AIIMS himself, without security, as a surprise - but Dr Bhargava firmly stopped him, citing safety concerns.\nBut not every day was as exciting.\nDr Bhargava recalls political pressure, including an MP who threatened her for not selecting his son-in-law for a job at AIIMS.\nOn another occasion, two top politicians, including the federal health secretary, tried to handpick the AIIMS dean - though the decision was hers alone.\nDr Bhargava says she stood firm against pressure, always prioritising patient care. She worked to establish radiology as a core part of diagnosis and treatment at AIIMS.\nWhen Dr Bhargava joined in the 1960s, AIIMS had only basic imaging tools. She trained colleagues to read subtle signs in black-and-white X-rays, always in context with the patient's history. She later pushed for better equipment, helping build one of India's leading radiology departments.\n\nDr Bhargava was always drawn to making a difference. \nBorn in 1930 into an affluent family in Lahore in undivided India, as a child she loved playing doctor to her dolls and siblings. During the partition of India and Pakistan, Dr Bhargava's family fled to India and later, she would visit refugee camps with her father to help people.\nAt a time when few Indian women pursued higher education, Dr Bhargava studied radiology in London - the only woman in both her class and hospital department.\nShe returned to India in the 1950s after hearing from her mentor that the country was in need of skilled radiologists.\nDr Bhargava often credits her family, and her husband's liberal-mindedness for helping her achieve her dreams, and she hopes other Indian women find the same support.\n\"It starts from childhood,\" she says. \n\"Parents should support their daughters the same way they support their sons. Only then will they be able to break glass ceilings and reach for the stars.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "It was a balmy Thursday afternoon at the residential hostel of the BJ Medical College and the canteen was teeming with students getting lunch.\nThe room buzzed with the sound of jokes, banter between friends, and the odd bit of academic discussion.\nBy 13:39 local time, there were at least 35 people in the cafeteria. Some had already collected their food and were lounging around, while others were in the queue waiting for their turn.\nThe students mixed with doctors and family members. Then, everything changed. \nThe general hum of the canteen was pierced by the sound of approaching jet engines - and then the room exploded.\nLess than a minute earlier, Flight AI171 had taken off from the runway at Ahmedabad's airport, just 1.5km (4,800ft) away.\nThe Air India 787 Dreamliner was bound for London, carrying 242 people.\nBut something had gone catastrophically wrong, and mere seconds after its wheels left the ground, the plane was in trouble. A mayday call was sent before it came crashing down into a busy residential area - on top of the doctors' hostel - sending a massive fireball into the sky and killing all but one person on board.\nThe BBC has spoken to eyewitnesses, including students who were in the hostel, along with friends of the trainee doctors who died and their teachers, to piece together what happened in those terrifying few seconds - and the aftermath that followed.\nPeople on the ground nearby couldn't immediately work out what had happened.\nA doctor, who works with the college's kidney sciences department, says he and his colleagues were in their building, about 500 metres away, when they heard a \"deafening sound\" outside.\n\"At first, we thought it was lightning. But then we wondered, could that be possible in 40C dry heat?\"\nThe doctors ran outside.\nThat's when they heard a few people screaming: \"Look, come here, a plane has crashed into our building.\"\nThe next few minutes were a blur. Scenes of chaos descended on the campus as people ran around trying to escape - or find out what had happened.\nBrothers Prince and Krish Patni were on their bikes just a few metres from the hostel when they heard the noise.\n\"Within seconds we could see something that resembled a wing of a plane,\" Prince, 18, told the BBC.\n\"We rushed to the scene, but the heat from the explosion was intense and we couldn't enter the hostel. There was a lot of debris.\"\nThe brothers, along with a few other volunteers from the local area, waited for the heat to subside before attempting to physically enter the building. They worked together with the police to move some of the debris from the entrance.\nWhen they finally reached the canteen, they couldn't see anyone.\nDark, dense clouds of smoke had engulfed the room. The air smelled of burned metal. The brothers, who just minutes before had been heading to play cricket, began removing cooking gas cylinders to avoid any further explosions, Krish, 20, explained.\nThe brothers and other volunteers then spotted a pile of suitcases and went to move them. What unfolded next, they said, was gut wrenching.\nBehind them, they began to make out the shapes of people.\nMost were alive. Some had spoons full of food in their hand, some had plates of food in front of them, and some had glasses in their hand.\nThey were all badly injured.\nThey were also silent, in shock. Just minutes before they were having their usual afternoon. Now, they were surrounded by charred metal pieces of aircraft.\n\"They didn't even get a chance to react,\" another doctor, who was in a nearby building, said.\nA second year student, who lives in the hostel, was among those who managed to escape.\nHe was sitting at his usual spot - a large table at the corner of the mess, next to one of the walls - with nine others when the plane crashed.\n\"There was a huge bang and a horrible screeching sound. Next thing we knew, we were under huge boulders, stuck without anywhere to go,\" he says. \"The fire and smoke of the crashed plane was close to our face and it was hard to breathe.\"\nHe received severe chest wounds in the accident and is still undergoing treatment at a local hospital. And he doesn't know what happened to his friends.\nMultiple eyewitnesses told the BBC the massive wing of the plane first pierced through the roof followed by parts of the fuselage. The damage was most severe where the wing fell.\nIn the chaos, students began to jump from as high as the second and third floors to escape. Students later told how one of the only staircases out was blocked by debris.\nIt is not known how many people were killed on the ground.\nDr Minakshi Parikh, dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, told the BBC that four of their students had died, as well as four students' relatives.\nBut exactly how many and who was killed may take days to establish: investigators need to rely on DNA to formally identify the bodies found in the wreckage.\nAnd it was not just people in the canteen at that moment who were killed.\nJust a few kilometres away was Ravi Thakur, who worked in the hostel kitchen. He had gone out to deliver lunch boxes in other hostels around the city. His mother and two-year-old son stayed behind as usual.\nWhen he heard the news, he rushed back but found utter chaos. Around 45 minutes had passed and the place was full of locals, firefighters, ambulance workers and Air India staff.\nHe tried to look for his mother but couldn't find her.\nBack at the main hospital block, teachers are still trying make sense of the chaos.\n\"I used to teach these students and knew them personally. The injured students are still being treated in the hospital, and they are our priority at the moment,\" one professor at the college told the BBC.\nMeanwhile, Ravi Thakur is still searching for his loved one, even as his hopes fade fast.",

What if my niece's remains have not even been found? The wait is killing us,\" he said.\nOfficials have refused to comment on Mr Jignesh's claim, but a fire department officer and a police official told the BBC on the condition of anonymity that a search for remains of the passengers is still under way.\nRajnish Patel, additional superintendent of the Civil Hospital, said on Saturday that 11 victims had been identified so far based on their DNA samples, adding that their families had been informed.\nThe Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which was on its way to London's Gatwick Airport, crashed and erupted in a fireball shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad's main airport, in what has been India's worst aviation disaster.\nOnly one of the 242 passengers and crew on board survived. At least eight others were killed as the plane struck the hostel of a medical college when it came down on a densely populated residential area near the airport.\nThings have moved swiftly since.\nThe Indian government has ordered a high-level investigation into the incident and has ordered all Boeing 787s operated by local carriers to be inspected. \nWhile the reason of the crash remains unknown, the country's aviation authority has said it is looking into all possible causes for the accident, also bringing in foreign aviation experts to assist with the inquiry.\nBack at the hospital, doctors are racing to complete the DNA sampling of the victims so that they can start returning bodies to their families.\nBut for families like Mr Jignesh's, time passes in dragging lulls.\nOfficials have talked about how the process of identifying bodies has been extremely challenging - and is being carried out in small batches - as most of the remains have been charred beyond recognition.\n\"There is no scope for mistakes here - we have to ensure that every family receives the right body,\" said HP Sanghvi, the director of Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Gandhinagar city. \"But DNA identification is a time-consuming process. Besides, given the scale of the disaster, there is also a possibility that the DNA of several passengers was damaged due to the extremely high temperature of the blast.\"\nJaishankar Pillai, a forensic dentist at the hospital, told reporters that his team has been trying to collect dental records from charred bodies, as that might be the only source of DNA left.\nThe wait has been beyond agonising for the families, many of whom refused to speak to the media, saying they just want to go back home with \"whatever is left of their loved ones\".\n\"We are in no condition to say anything. Words fail us right now,\" a woman, who was waiting with three members of her family outside the autopsy room, told the BBC impatiently, as she quickly slipped into her car.\nMeanwhile, officials at the BJ Medical College have started to vacate several wards of the hostel, near which the plane struck. So far, four wards - including the hostel canteen, the site of the crash - have been completely emptied out.\nBut students living in other nearby wings of the hostel have also begun to leave.\n\"In one of the wards, there are just three people left - everyone else has gone back to their homes for now. They will leave soon too, but until then, they are sitting there, all alone, haunted by the memory of what has happened,\" their friend, who is also a student at the college and wanted to stay anonymous, said.\nBut between the college and hospital - in the vast expanse of this city of more than seven million people - there are many others who also are reeling from the tragedy.\nThe last Kartik Kalawadia heard of his brother Mahesh was on Thursday, some 30 minutes before the crash.\nIt was a phone call Mahesh made to his wife: \"I am coming home,\" he said to her.\nShe never heard from him again.\nA music producer in the Gujarati film industry, Mahesh had been on his way back home from work that day and was crossing the area when the plane hurtled down and crashed into the buildings.\nMr Kalawadia told the BBC that his brother's last location before his phone became unreachable was just a few hundred metres away from BJ Medical college.\nThe family has since filed a police complaint and has made countless visits to the Civil Hospital. They have found nothing so far.\n\"The hospital told us they have no record of my brother. We also tried tracing his scooter, but nothing came of that either,\" Mr Kalawadia said.\n\"It's like he vanished into thin air.\"\nAt a press conference on Saturday, Civil Aviation Secretary SK Sinha admitted that the last two days had been \"very hard\", but assured the investigation was proceeding smoothly and in the right direction.\nBut Mr Kalawadia wondered if any of these inquires - into the plane crash, the victims and beyond - would help him find his brother, dead or alive.\n\"We don't know the answer, but we can hope it's a positive one, I guess,\" he said.\nBack at the Civil Hospital, the wait continues to haunt families.\nWhen the BBC last met Imtiyaz Ali Sayed over Thursday night, he was still in denial that his family - his brother Javed along with his wife and two children - could have died in the crash.\nBut on Saturday, he seemed closer to \"accepting the truth\".\n\"With just a few hours left, we are now trying to decide what will it be: will we bury him here, or in the UK, where his wife's family lives,\" he said.\n\"To me, it makes no difference you know?\" he continued, \"because he's gone, from ashes to dust and back to God.\"\nAdditional reporting by Antriksha Pathania in Ahmedabad",

        "article_text": "Listen to Theo read this article\nWhile the preliminary report into what caused the loss of Air India Flight 171 last month has provided some answers, it has also prompted a wave of speculation about its cause. \nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a building less than a minute after take-off from the city of Ahmedabad in western India en route to London, killing 241 people on board, along with 19 on the ground. One passenger survived.\nInformation contained in India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau report, the first official account of what happened, has raised questions about the role of the pilots.\nHowever, experts within the aviation industry claim investigators have been highly selective in what they have chosen to say.\nUnder international protocols, the state leading an air accident investigation is meant to issue a preliminary report within 30 days. The 15-page document published by India's Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday fulfils this requirement.\nAlthough the AAIB has been leading the investigation, US interests are also represented, because Boeing, the maker of the aircraft, and GE Aerospace, the engine manufacturer are American.\nThe report does not set out any conclusions as to the cause of the accident. Nevertheless, it has sparked considerable controversy.\nIn its account of the accident flight, the AAIB states that two fuel cut-off switches were moved from the \"run\" to the \"cut-off\" position seconds after take-off. \nThis deprived the engines of fuel and caused them to lose thrust. Although data from the flight recorder shows the engines were subsequently restarted, it was too late to prevent the crash.\nThese switches are normally only used to turn the engines on before a flight and off afterwards. They have a locking mechanism, which means they need to be pulled out before being flipped, a system designed to prevent accidental deployment.\nThe report also states that one pilot asks the other \"why did you cut off?\", while his colleague responded that he \"did not do so\". \nHowever, it does not provide any direct transcript of the conversation, which would have been picked up by the cockpit voice recorder. Nor does it identify which pilot asked the question.\nIt is worth remembering that preliminary reports are not intended to offer a full picture of what happened or draw firm conclusions. They are meant to be a factual summary of the information obtained in the early stages of what could be a lengthy investigation. \nThe investigating authority is also under no obligation to make their preliminary reports public.\nThe information released so far has prompted a number of commentators to claim, in the media and online, that the accident was the result of deliberate and intentional action by one of the pilots.\nIt is a view that has attracted an angry response from the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, which warned that \"invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible \u2013 it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved\".\nIt added that: \"To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting\".\nIn a memo to staff, the chief executive of Air India struck a similar note. Campbell Wilson warned against drawing \"premature conclusions\".\nSince the report was issued, the BBC has spoken to a range of people within the industry, including pilots, accident investigators and engineers. While theories as to what actually happened vary widely, the dominant view is that important information is currently missing.\n\"They've told us stuff they want us to know at the moment, and withheld what they don't want us to know,\" explained one pilot, who asked not to be identified. \"It's not a complete report.\"\nOne of the main criticisms is the lack of a transcript from the cockpit voice recorder, which would enable the reported conversation between the pilots about the fuel cut-off switches to be put in context.\nBjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical analyst at consultants Leeham Company said this was \"totally unacceptable\".\n\"They have all this technical detail. Then you have this reference to dialogue, but it doesn't even tell you who's speaking,\" he said.\nMr Fehrm was also concerned that there was no reference to what happened in the cockpit between the switches being flipped from run to cut-off, and the first switch being pushed back into position to relight the first engine 10 seconds later.\n\"It's someone trying to hide something,\" he said.\nAn engineering source, meanwhile, said the report was \"very selective\", and did not have any detailed information about what the engines were doing immediately before the switches were flipped. The document does say that the engine speed began to decrease from take-off values \"as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off.\"\nThis, they said was important - because flipping the switches to cut-off and back was something a pilot would be trained do to in order to restart an engine that was already losing power.\nTim Atkinson, an aviation consultant and former air accident investigator in the UK said, \"it is very disappointing to read a report which does provide a few salient facts, but leaves many more questions\".\nAnother element of the report that has caused controversy is a reference to a safety bulletin \u2013 known as a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin \u2013 published by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2018.\nThis was used to alert the aviation community that operators of some Boeing 737 models had reported cases in which the fuel cut-off switches had been fitted with the locking feature disengaged - potentially enabling the switch to be flipped by accident.\nAt the time, the FAA described this as an \"airworthiness concern\", but said it was \"not an unsafe condition\" that would require mandatory action via what is known as an Airworthiness Directive. \nOperators of a number of different Boeing models fitted with similar switches, including 787s, were advised to carry out simple inspections.\nThe investigation report says Air India did not carry out those inspections - prompting speculation that the accident could have been caused by faulty switches being flipped by accident.\nHowever, in an internal note seen by the BBC, the FAA has since reiterated its belief that the issue did not compromise safety.\nEngineering sources have also pointed out that the report says the throttle control module on the crashed aircraft was replaced on two occasions, most recently two years before the accident. This would have involved replacing the cut-off switches as well.\nAccording to Bjorn Fehrm of Leeham Company, the reference to the FAA's advice contained in the report was \"totally irrelevant\" in the context of the accident.\nNevertheless, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation has asked the operators of all aircraft covered by the FAA's original bulletin to carry out inspections by 21 July.\nFor former accident investigator Tim Atkinson, the vagueness of the report may have been deliberate - in order to suggest an explanation for the crash, while avoiding being too explicit.\n\"The very worst reports are those written to be read 'between the lines', and if that is what we have here, then it does no credit to the investigators,\" he said.\nMeanwhile those seeking firm answers to what happened on Flight 171 may well have to wait. \nInternational protocols stipulate that a final report should be published within a year of the accident. However, in practice, it can take a lot longer than that.",

        "article_text": "In the winter of 1956, The Times correspondent David Holden arrived on the island of Bahrain, then still a British protectorate. \nAfter a short-lived career teaching geography, Holden had looked forward to his Arabian posting, but he hadn't expected to be attending a garden durbar in honour of Queen Victoria's appointment as Empress of India. \nEverywhere that he went in the Gulf - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Oman - he found expected traces of British India. \n\"The Raj maintains here a slightly phantasmal sway,\" wrote Holden, \"a situation rich in anomaly and anachronism\u2026 The servants are all bearers, the laundryman a dhobi, and the watchman a chowkidar,\" he wrote, \"and on Sundays the guests are confronted with the ancient, and agreeable, Anglo-Indian ritual of a mountainous curry lunch.\" \nThe Sultan of Oman, educated in Rajasthan, was more fluent in Urdu than Arabic, while soldiers in the nearby state of Qu'aiti, now eastern Yemen, marched around in now-defunct Hyderabadi army uniforms.\nIn the words of the governor of Aden himself: \n\"One had an extraordinarily powerful impression that all the clocks here had stopped seventy years ago; that the Raj was at its height, Victoria on the throne, Gilbert and Sullivan a fresh and revolutionary phenomenon, and Kipling a dangerous debunker, so strong was the link from Delhi via Hyderabad to the South Arabian shore.\"\nAlthough largely forgotten today, in the early 20th Century, nearly a third of the Arabian Peninsula was ruled as part of the British Indian Empire. \nFrom Aden to Kuwait, a crescent of Arabian protectorates was governed from Delhi, overseen by the Indian Political Service, policed by Indian troops, and answerable to the Viceroy of India.\nUnder the Interpretation Act of 1889, these protectorates had all legally been considered part of India. \nThe standard list of India's semi-independent princely states like Jaipur opened alphabetically with Abu Dhabi, and the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, even suggested that Oman should be treated \"as much a Native State of the Indian Empire as Lus Beyla or Kelat [present day Balochistan]\". \nIndian passports were issued as far west as Aden in modern Yemen, which functioned as India's westernmost port and was administered as part of Bombay Province. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1931, he found many young Arabs identifying as Indian nationalists.\nEven at the time, however, few members of the British or Indian public were aware of this Arabian extension of the British Raj. \nMaps showing the full reach of the Indian Empire were only published in top secrecy, and the Arabian territories were left off public documents to avoid provoking the Ottomans or later the Saudis. \nIndeed, as one Royal Asiatic Society lecturer quipped:\n\"As a jealous sheikh veils his favourite wife, so the British authorities shroud conditions in the Arab states in such thick mystery that ill-disposed propagandists might almost be excused for thinking that something dreadful is going on there.\"\nBut by the 1920s, politics was shifting. Indian nationalists began to imagine India not as an imperial construct but as a cultural space rooted in the geography of the Mahabharata. London saw an opportunity to redraw borders. On 1 April 1937, the first of several imperial partitions was enacted and Aden was separated from India. \nA telegram from King George VI was read aloud:\n\"Aden has been an integral part of British Indian administration for nearly 100 years. That political association with my Indian Empire will now be broken, and Aden will take its place in my Colonial Empire.\"\nThe Gulf remained under the purview of the Government of India for another decade, however. \nBritish officials briefly discussed whether India or Pakistan would \"be allowed to run the Persian Gulf\" after independence, yet a member of the British legation in Tehran even wrote of his surprise at the \"apparent unanimity\" of \"officials in Delhi \u2026 that the Persian Gulf was of little interest to the Government of India.\"\nAs Gulf resident William Hay put it, \"it would clearly have been inappropriate to hand over responsibility for dealing with the Gulf Arabs to Indians or Pakistanis\". \nThe Gulf states, from Dubai to Kuwait, were thus finally separated from India on 1 April 1947, months before the Raj was itself divided into India and Pakistan and granted independence.\nMonths later, when Indian and Pakistani officials set about integrating hundreds of princely states into the new nations, the Arab states of the Gulf would be missing from the ledger. \nFew batted an eyelid, and 75 years on, the importance of what had just happened is still not fully understood in either India or the Gulf. \nWithout this minor administrative transfer, it is likely that the states of the Persian Gulf Residency would have become part of either India or Pakistan after independence, as happened to every other princely state in the subcontinent.\nWhen British Prime Minister Clement Attlee proposed a British withdrawal from the Arabian territories at the same time as the withdrawal from India, he was shouted down. So Britain retained its role in the Gulf for 24 more years, with an 'Arabian Raj' now reporting to Whitehall rather than to the Viceroy of India. \nIn the words of Gulf scholar Paul Rich, this was \"the Indian Empire's last redoubt, just as Goa was Portuguese India's last solitary vestige, or Pondicherry was the tag-end of French India\".\nThe official currency was still the Indian rupee; the easiest mode of transport was still the 'British India Line' (shipping company) and the 30 Arabian princely states were still governed by 'British residents' who had made their careers in the Indian Political Service.\nThe British only finally pulled out of the Gulf in 1971 as part of its decision to abandon colonial commitments east of Suez. \nAs David Holden wrote in July: \n\"For the first time since the heyday of Britain's East India Company, all the territories around the Gulf will be at liberty to seek their own salvation without the threat of British intervention, or the comfort of British protection. This final remnant of the British Raj - for that, in effect, is what it is \u2013 has been for some years now an obvious, if in some ways charming, anachronism \u2026 But its day is over.\"\nOf all the national narratives that emerged after the Empire's collapse, the Gulf states have been most successful at erasing their ties to British India. \nFrom Bahrain to Dubai, a past relationship with Britain is remembered, but governance from Delhi is not. The myth of an ancient sovereignty is crucial to keeping the monarchies alive. Yet private memories persist, particularly of the unimaginable class reversal that the Gulf has seen. \nIn 2009, Gulf scholar Paul Rich recorded an elderly Qatari gentleman who \"still got angry when he related to me the beating he received when as a young boy of seven or eight he stole an orange, a fruit which he had never seen before, from an Indian employee of the British agent\". \n\"The Indians, he said, were a privileged caste during his youth, and it gave him immense pleasure that the tables had turned and they now came to the Gulf as servants.\"\nToday Dubai, once a minor outpost of the Indian Empire with no gun salute, is the glittering centre of the new Middle East. \nFew of the millions of Indians or Pakistanis who live there know that there was a world in which India or Pakistan might have inherited the oil-rich Gulf, just as they did Jaipur, Hyderabad or Bahawalpur. \nA quiet bureaucratic decision, made in the twilight of empire, severed that link. Today, only the echoes remain.\nSam Dalrymple is the author of Shattered Lands: Five Partitions and the Making of Modern Asia",

They usually remain steadfast in their wish to look forward rather than back and find the positives in any situation.\nFour of England's highest 10 fourth-innings chases have come under Stokes and McCullum, including 371 to win the first Test last week and 378 against India at Edgbaston in 2022.\nThat has influenced Stokes' decision to bowl first in 10 of the 11 matches he has won the toss in England. This is only their second defeat when doing so.\n\"We thought this pitch might get better to bat on as we went through the five days but as we saw it didn't,\" McCullum said.\nRather than blame the toss, Stokes pointed to England's inability to knock over India's lower order in the first innings, where they recovered from 211-5.\n\"No-one's got a crystal ball, no-one really knows what a wicket's going to do,\" Stokes said.\n\"Having them 211-5, we were happy there - even five down at the end of day one.\n\"We just weren't able to bust them open. We had a chance to potentially bowl them out for under 350 on that wicket, which would have been a good effort.\"\nStokes said he was not concerned by his bowlers' toil during the match. England have responded by adding seamer Gus Atkinson, who has missed the first two Tests with a hamstring injury, to an otherwise unchanged squad for the third Test at Lord's which starts on Thursday. \nJofra Archer might also come in for his first Test in four years after a series of injuries, while Sam Cook and Jamie Overton could also come into contention given the quick turnaround.\nEngland squad for third Test against India: Ben Stokes (captain), Gus Atkinson, Jacob Bethell, Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jamie Smith (wicketkeeper), Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, Jofra Archer, Sam Cook, Jamie Overton, Shoaib Bashir.\nThis video can not be played\n'Superb' India performance hands England defeat\nIndia captain Shubman Gill confirmed his star bowler Jasprit Bumrah will \"definitely\" return at Lord's, having sat out this match to manage his return from a back injury.\nIn Bumrah's place, Akash Deep took a superb 10-187 across the match.\n\"He bowled with so much heart and skilfully with his lengths,\" Gill said.\n\"He moved it in both directions, which was tough to do. He was magnificent for us.\"\nIn making 269 in the first innings and 161 in the second, Gill scored 430 runs across the Test - the second most across both innings in Test history.\nThe victory, India's first at Edgbaston, is also his first as captain.\n\"I am feeling comfortable with my game and if we can win the series that would be a great achievement for us,\" Gill, 25, said.\n\"Every day is a learning curve for me.\"",

        "article_text": "It was a balmy Thursday afternoon at the residential hostel of the BJ Medical College and the canteen was teeming with students getting lunch.\nThe room buzzed with the sound of jokes, banter between friends, and the odd bit of academic discussion.\nBy 13:39 local time, there were at least 35 people in the cafeteria. Some had already collected their food and were lounging around, while others were in the queue waiting for their turn.\nThe students mixed with doctors and family members. Then, everything changed. \nThe general hum of the canteen was pierced by the sound of approaching jet engines - and then the room exploded.\nLess than a minute earlier, Flight AI171 had taken off from the runway at Ahmedabad's airport, just 1.5km (4,800ft) away.\nThe Air India 787 Dreamliner was bound for London, carrying 242 people.\nBut something had gone catastrophically wrong, and mere seconds after its wheels left the ground, the plane was in trouble. A mayday call was sent before it came crashing down into a busy residential area - on top of the doctors' hostel - sending a massive fireball into the sky and killing all but one person on board.\nThe BBC has spoken to eyewitnesses, including students who were in the hostel, along with friends of the trainee doctors who died and their teachers, to piece together what happened in those terrifying few seconds - and the aftermath that followed.\nPeople on the ground nearby couldn't immediately work out what had happened.\nA doctor, who works with the college's kidney sciences department, says he and his colleagues were in their building, about 500 metres away, when they heard a \"deafening sound\" outside.\n\"At first, we thought it was lightning. But then we wondered, could that be possible in 40C dry heat?\"\nThe doctors ran outside.\nThat's when they heard a few people screaming: \"Look, come here, a plane has crashed into our building.\"\nThe next few minutes were a blur. Scenes of chaos descended on the campus as people ran around trying to escape - or find out what had happened.\nBrothers Prince and Krish Patni were on their bikes just a few metres from the hostel when they heard the noise.\n\"Within seconds we could see something that resembled a wing of a plane,\" Prince, 18, told the BBC.\n\"We rushed to the scene, but the heat from the explosion was intense and we couldn't enter the hostel. There was a lot of debris.\"\nThe brothers, along with a few other volunteers from the local area, waited for the heat to subside before attempting to physically enter the building. They worked together with the police to move some of the debris from the entrance.\nWhen they finally reached the canteen, they couldn't see anyone.\nDark, dense clouds of smoke had engulfed the room. The air smelled of burned metal. The brothers, who just minutes before had been heading to play cricket, began removing cooking gas cylinders to avoid any further explosions, Krish, 20, explained.\nThe brothers and other volunteers then spotted a pile of suitcases and went to move them. What unfolded next, they said, was gut wrenching.\nBehind them, they began to make out the shapes of people.\nMost were alive. Some had spoons full of food in their hand, some had plates of food in front of them, and some had glasses in their hand.\nThey were all badly injured.\nThey were also silent, in shock. Just minutes before they were having their usual afternoon. Now, they were surrounded by charred metal pieces of aircraft.\n\"They didn't even get a chance to react,\" another doctor, who was in a nearby building, said.\nA second year student, who lives in the hostel, was among those who managed to escape.\nHe was sitting at his usual spot - a large table at the corner of the mess, next to one of the walls - with nine others when the plane crashed.\n\"There was a huge bang and a horrible screeching sound. Next thing we knew, we were under huge boulders, stuck without anywhere to go,\" he says. \"The fire and smoke of the crashed plane was close to our face and it was hard to breathe.\"\nHe received severe chest wounds in the accident and is still undergoing treatment at a local hospital. And he doesn't know what happened to his friends.\nMultiple eyewitnesses told the BBC the massive wing of the plane first pierced through the roof followed by parts of the fuselage. The damage was most severe where the wing fell.\nIn the chaos, students began to jump from as high as the second and third floors to escape. Students later told how one of the only staircases out was blocked by debris.\nIt is not known how many people were killed on the ground.\nDr Minakshi Parikh, dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, told the BBC that four of their students had died, as well as four students' relatives.\nBut exactly how many and who was killed may take days to establish: investigators need to rely on DNA to formally identify the bodies found in the wreckage.\nAnd it was not just people in the canteen at that moment who were killed.\nJust a few kilometres away was Ravi Thakur, who worked in the hostel kitchen. He had gone out to deliver lunch boxes in other hostels around the city. His mother and two-year-old son stayed behind as usual.\nWhen he heard the news, he rushed back but found utter chaos. Around 45 minutes had passed and the place was full of locals, firefighters, ambulance workers and Air India staff.\nHe tried to look for his mother but couldn't find her.\nBack at the main hospital block, teachers are still trying make sense of the chaos.\n\"I used to teach these students and knew them personally. The injured students are still being treated in the hospital, and they are our priority at the moment,\" one professor at the college told the BBC.\nMeanwhile, Ravi Thakur is still searching for his loved one, even as his hopes fade fast.",

The government had rejected the allegations.\nThe wrestlers agreed to pause their protests after meeting Home Minister Amit Shah and then Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.\nThakur assured them that charges would be filed against Singh by 15 June 2023.\nSeven female wrestlers, including the minor, registered complaints with the police accusing Singh of molesting and groping them at training camps and tournaments. \nIn the case of the minor, police had invoked the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.\nSingh, denied all the allegations, accusing the wrestlers of being \"politically motivated\".\nWeeks later, the minor retracted her earlier statements and withdrew her allegations, reports said. Wrestler Sakshi Malik told the BBC at the time that she believed \"the player was pressurised into withdrawing the charges\". Mr Singh refused to comment on the allegation, saying \"let law take its course\".\nOn Monday, legal news site Bar and Bench reported that the police had given a report in court seeking cancellation of the case as the minor wrestler's father said he had made a false complaint.\nThe prosecution lawyer said \"no corroborative evidence\" had been found in the allegations after a detailed investigation in the case.\nBar and Bench said the wrestler and her father had appeared before the court and expressed satisfaction with the police investigation. They also did not oppose the cancellation report.\nIn the aftermath of the row, Singh had stepped down as the wrestling federation chief. He was replaced by his close aide Sanjay Singh, who was later elected as the organisation's chief, leading to the accusation that Brij Bhushan Singh was still running it by proxy. The two Singhs denied the accusation but the federal sports ministry suspended the federation in December 2023.\nIn 2024, the federation resumed its functions after United World Wrestling, the international, organisation governing wrestling, lifted its ban on the Indian federation. Earlier this year, The Hindu and Indian Express newspapers reported that the Wrestling Federation of India was functioning out of Singh's address in Delhi.\nSingh was also denied a ticket by the BJP to contest the 2024 general election. The party instead fielded his son Karan Bhushan Singh from Kaiserganj - the seat in the northern Uttar Pradesh state which the senior Singh had held since 1999. The junior Singh won the election.",
