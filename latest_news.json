        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

        "article_text": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.\nDespite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.\nIt also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. \nIn a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.\nDelhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".\nThe IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.\nEven Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persiste\nntly seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\n\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.\nIndia's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".\nAs one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.\nUnlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.\nFor example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, most IMF decisions are made not by a formal vote, but by consensus, where voting against a proposal is not an option. In case a member is strictly not agreeable to a proposal they can abstain & register their dissent, what India did in this case.\n\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.\nAddressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.\nIn their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.\nFurthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.\n\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. \nThe FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\n\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"\nAs things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.\nSeparately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.\nSuch reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.\nMr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.\nHe points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.\n\"Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,\" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. \n\"But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.\"\nShe had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. \nMoving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.\nLovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.\n\"Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,\" Lovina jokes. \"I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.\"\nSo she posted an open message on her Facebook account: \"Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?\"\nTo her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.\nShe quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.\n\"I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,\" she says. \"I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.\"\nLovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. \nAccording to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. \nIndians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.\nFollowing that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. \nShortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.\nLovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupra\u2060, Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. \nThey say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.\nThe community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. \nThey say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. \nA member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.\n\"The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,\" she says.\nBeyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. \nIn one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. \nNishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.\n\"The group was her first port of call,\" says Nishi. \"As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.\"\nAnother woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.\n\"I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,\" Priya says.\n\"Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused.\" \nSo she asked the group and they offered advice.\nPriya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.\n\"The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,\" says Priya. \"I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.\"\nThere has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. \nLovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.\n\"I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,\" says Lovina.\n\"I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.\"\nLovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. \nIt has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation.\nThe World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority.\nThe members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.\n\"We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,\" says Lovina. \"I think that's the biggest support system for us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead \"accountable\".\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nPakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims. \nPakistan's military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 26 people were killed and 46 injured. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" is false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists visiting the region.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it. \nBut Indian police have alleged two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacked by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN chief Antonio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\".

What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir35 minutes agoShareSaveFlora DruryBBC NewsShareSaveReutersA city view of Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administrated KashmirTwo weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead \"accountable\".But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".Follow the latest updatesWhy India and Pakistan fight over KashmirBBC reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered KashmirPakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.Where did India hit?Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.It said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.Why is Kashmir a flashpoint between India and Pakistan?Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.The countries have fought two wars over it.But more recently, it has been attacked by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink.",

He spent nearly eight days there.\nAx-4 is led by former Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson - a space veteran who has been commander of ISS twice, spent hundreds of days in space and done 10 space walks. \nThe team also includes Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary - just like the Indian astronaut, they will also be taking their countries back to space after more than four decades. \nExperts say the pilot's role is key, as he would serve as second-in-command to the mission commander, assisting with spacecraft operations during launch, docking, undocking and return to Earth.\nThe astronauts, who have been in quarantine since 25 May to prepare for the trip, addressed a press conference on Tuesday night where they showed-off Joy - a small, white toy swan they said would be \"the fifth crew member\" on Ax-4.\n\"We are good for the launch, we have completed all the training and the team has bonded well,\" Commander Whitson said.\nDescribing the past year as \"nothing short of transformative\" for him, Group Captain Shukla said he did not have words to describe his excitement.\n\"It has been an amazing journey so far, but the best is yet to come,\" he said. \n\"As I go into space, I carry not just instruments and equipment, I carry hopes and dreams of a billion hearts.\n\"I request all Indians to pray for the success of our mission,\" he added.\nThe 39-year-old was among four Indian air force officers shortlisted last year to travel on the country's first-ever human space flight, scheduled for 2027.\nThe Gaganyaan mission aims to send three astronauts to an orbit of 400km and bring them back after three days. India has also announced ambitious plans to set up a space station by 2035 and send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.\nIndia's space agency Isro has been carrying out a number of tests to prepare for Gaganyaan. In December, it plans to send a female humanoid robot to space as part of the tests.\nSo, officials say the mission comes as a \"unique exciting opportunity\" for Isro and has generated a lot of interest in India.\nThe trip to ISS aboard Ax-4 - a commercial flight operated by Houston-based private company Axiom Space - is a collaborative effort between Nasa, Isro and European Space Agency (Esa).\nTuesday's flight will be launched using the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket. \nIsro, which has paid 5bn rupees ($59m; \u00a343m) to secure a seat for Group Captain Shukla and his training, says the experience he will gain during his trip to the ISS will help India immensely.\n\"The benefit we will get from this mission is phenomenal in terms of the training, exposure to the facilities and the experience of jointly conducting experiments in space,\" Isro Chairman V Narayanan recently said.\nSudeesh Balan, Isro project director, said Group Captain Shukla had been training since August last year. \n\"He's undergone rigorous training, including physical and psychological assessments, to prepare for the journey.\"\nBorn on 10 October 1985 in the northern city of Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla joined the Indian air force as a fighter pilot in 2006. \nAccording to Axiom Space, he has over 2,000 hours of flying experience and has flown MiGs, Sukhois, Dorniers, Jaguars and Hawks.\nHis sister Shuchi Mishra, however, told the BBC that his entry into the air force was \"accidental\".\n\"When he was 17 and in high school, his friend got a form to apply to the National Defence Academy. But this friend was slightly overage so he was not qualified. Not wanting to waste the form, Shubhanshu filled it up,\" Ms Mishra said.\n\"He was selected - and has never looked back.\"\nMs Mishra says their family \"is thrilled as one of ours has been chosen out of India's 1.4 billion people\" for this mission.\n\"We all feel so privileged and proud that he's a part of our family and that we've been a part of his journey.\"\nHer brother, she says, is undertaking this journey for his country - for the next generation.\n\"He always tells people to dream big, to do something for the nation. We are hoping that his trip will inspire the next generation.\"\nBesides piloting the mission, the Indian astronaut will have a busy schedule during his time on ISS.\nConsidering the huge interest in the flight, Isro has said they are organising events for him to interact with Indian students and answer their questions while floating in space.\n\"We believe it will motivate our young minds to become passionate about space tech,\" Mr Balan said.\nBut most of the time, the four-member crew will be conducting 60 scientific experiments, seven of which come from India. \nFormer Nasa scientist Mila Mitra says Isro's experiments will help improve our understanding of space and its effects on biology and micro-gravity.\nOne of the key experiments, she explains, will investigate the impact of spaceflight on six varieties of crop seeds. \n\"This project aims to help understand how crops may be grown in space for future exploration missions. After the mission, seeds will be grown for multiple generations and plants showing preferred traits will be selected for genetic analyses.\"\nAnother Isro experiment involves growing three strains of microalgae which could be used as food, fuel or even in life support systems and this will help identify the most suitable ones for growing in microgravity, she says.\nThe Isro projects would also investigate how tardigrades - micro-animals on Earth that can survive extreme environments - would fare in space. \n\"The project will examine the revival of dormant tardigrades, count the number of eggs laid and hatched during a mission, and compare space-flown versus ground control populations,\" Ms Mitra says.\nThe other experiments aim to identify how muscle loss occurs in space and how it can be treated; and the physical and cognitive impact of using computer screens in microgravity. \n\"The research will study how gaze fixation and rapid eye movements are affected by being in space, and how this may affect an astronaut's stress and wellbeing. The results could influence future spacecraft computer design and interaction,\" she says.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma made two superb saves to keep out Arsenal last week - this stop from Gabriel Martinelli, and another to deny Leandro Trossard\nA calamity keeper or the human wall? Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday.\nWill they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win?\nOr could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt?\nArsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign.\nHis supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.\nStill, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020.\nThis video can not be played\nItaly win in penalty shootout against England to become European champions\nHe has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too.\nIn any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness.\nSo, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist?\nBBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer.\nGianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically.\nThat clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else.\n\"He's massive, but his positional awareness in his box is excellent,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"That's down to the depth perception he has when he is reading a through ball and his understanding of where his line is.\n\"A lot of goalkeepers get sucked into rushing off their line to try to close down the angle and to close down the shot, and they think they are in a better position further away from the goal. It is something I did myself sometimes, and you find the shot is past you before you are ready.\n\"What Donnarumma does instead, very cleverly, is stay closer to his line, maybe two or three yards away. Because of his size he knows he can cover most of his goal from there anyway.\n\"The save he made low down with his left hand from Trossard's shot last week was the perfect example of that, and of him knowing exactly where he is in relation to his line.\n\"As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. Instead, he holds his position, and makes the save on the angle.\n\"It is a brilliant save and it is his physique that allows him to make it, but also down to his technique and his positional awareness, which is second to none.\"\nWhile his form has fluctuated, Donnarumma's contract situation is the main reason why his future is uncertain.\nHe has one year left on the five-year deal he signed when he joined PSG, and has reportedly been in talks about an extension.\nAccording to his agent, Enzo Raiola, Donnarumma wants to stay - but he has been also been linked to a summer return to Serie A, and Milan, with Inter, while it appears PSG may have alternatives in mind too.\n\"The club are taking their time to decide what to do,\" explained French football journalist Laurens.\n\"They like Lucas Chevalier at Lille a lot and Luis Campos (PSG's football advisor in charge of recruitment) knows Chevalier well from when he was there.\"\nChevalier was reported to be one of Manchester United's targets before they signed Andre Onana as David de Gea's replacement. He helped Lille beat Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the group stage of this season's Champions League before the French side lost to Borussia Dortmund in the last 16\nChevalier, 23, is known for his passing proficiency as well as his saving ability and is seen as the future of French goalkeeping. He broke into the senior squad for the first time at the end of 2024, although he is yet to make his senior debut for Les Bleus.\n\"PSG have not made their minds up,\" added Laurens. \"Can they really get an upgrade on Donnarumma and, if so, is Chevalier that player?\n\"Any money they get for Donnarumma \u2013 maybe \u00a325-30m - would be pure profit, but then it would probably cost around \u00a350m to get Chevalier, so what do they do?\n\"The problem they have with Donnarumma is not on his line, where he is great - everyone at the club recognises that. It is just I think (PSG boss) Luis Enrique would rather have a good goalkeeper who is better with the ball at his feet.\n\"Still, it is a difficult decision. Of course it is ideal if you can get everything you need in a goalkeeper, but I am not sure Chevalier has everything yet.\"\nPSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. He went on to score a 17-minute hat-trick to send Real into the quarter-finals\nIt is Donnarumma's mistakes that have led some PSG fans to lose patience with him, and seen him targeted by the French media, with one performance in particular proving hard to forget.\n\"He got some criticism recently for Harvey Elliott's goal against Liverpool, which was bad, then he made a mistake when they lost to Nice too, when their first goal went under his arm,\" Laurens said.\n\"For a long time, though, he has been seen as just not being good enough at crosses or set-pieces.\nKai Havertz put Arsenal ahead in their group-stage win over PSG in October, capitalising when Donnarumma failed to deal with a Leandro Trossard cross\n\"He has tried to work on that, just like he has tried to improve with the ball at his feet, but I don't see much of an improvement with any of his weaknesses.\n\"I think also he still carries with him his worst moment, the Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022.\n\"PSG were 1-0 up at the Bernabeu with 30 minutes to go after winning the first leg 1-0 too, but then Karim Benzema kind of barged into Donnarumma, got the ball off him and scored - and then Benzema scored two more goals quickly and PSG were out.\n\"A lot of fans remember that moment, and they feel that there is another mistake coming somewhere, but every time we see him doing well, that surely gets him more points to stay and have his contract extended than the other way around.\"\nDonnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world.\nThe CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded.\nIt places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20.\nDonnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. He has played 151 games all competitions for the French side, and has won Ligue 1 four times\nRobinson used a different criteria, including his eyes, to come up with an alternative top three where Alisson does appear, along with Donnarumma.\n\"For me, Alisson is the best in the world, because he hasn't forgotten the fundamentals of goalkeeping, which are to keep the ball out of the net,\" Robinson explained.\n\"Commanding your box, communicating with your back four, stopping shots and dealing with one on ones are all part of that, but he can adapt to the modern way of playing out from the back too, without taking it to the next level like Ederson does.\n\"Ederson is the best with his feet but for the all-round package there is Alisson, Jan Oblak at Atletico Madrid and Donnarumma, and you can put those three in the same bracket.\n\"To be the very best you need the right mindset too, and Donnarumma has that. He has played so many games since his debut for AC Milan aged 16 that he is much more experienced than most keepers his age.\n\"That maturity means he is comfortable on the biggest stage, and can make a difference the way he has done so many times already.\n\"There is this uncertainty about where he will be next year but I bet PSG are glad they have got him at the moment - if they go on to win the Champions League this season, he will play a huge part in that.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "summary": "Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday.Will they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win?Or could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt?Arsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign.His supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.Still, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Italy win in penalty shootout against England to become European championsHe has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too.In any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness.So, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist?BBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer. \"'He still carries with him his worst moment'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, PSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. \"How does he compare to the world's best?Donnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world.The CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded.It places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Donnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. \"As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. 'His positional awareness is second to none'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions LeagueAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically.That clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else.",

        "article_text": "The Italian island immediately conjures up grand bougainvillea-draped villas and a whitewashed city centre, lined by luxury boutiques. But that's \u2013 literally \u2013 only half of the story.\n\"Bring water,\" they said when I announced I'd be hiking the Sentiero dei Fortini (Trail of Little Forts). \"There's nothing out there.\"\nThe six-kilometre cliffside path linking the remains of three 19th-Century Bourbon military outposts was my fourth hike on this craggy Mediterranean island. Somewhere along the rocky, wild rosemary-flocked path while dodging spiky prickly pears, I realised that I'd only seen one other human in two hours. And there were indeed no water sources, aside from a rustic fountain I'd encountered a kilometre back at Fort M\u00e8sola.\nMy Google Maps sputtered. I'd already got lost twice before noting that the ceramic path markers were low to the ground, cataloguing the area's flora and fauna \u2013 fig trees and wildflowers, wall lizards and falcons. The terrain faded from wilderness to sheer crags. Finally at the last fort, Fort Orrico, I could see straight down to the sea; a 30m death drop. The islands of Ischia and Procida loomed in the Gulf of Naples like the humps of petrified sea monsters. And I was completely alone at the island's edge; triumphant.\nThis is Capri. But perhaps not as you imagine it.\nTypically, the word Capri conjures up bougainvillea-draped villas and luxury boutique-lined streets; a yacht dock for the glitterati and the perpetual artists' muse. Paul Feig's Another Simple Favor, which premiered on 1 May on Prime Video, is the latest film set against the island's opulent hotel culture and majestic cliffs, and is sure to inspire a fresh slew of Capri travel dreams.\nBut in Capri, glamour is \u2013 literally \u2013 only half of the story.\nThe camel-humped Capri \u2013 one of Italy's three volcanic Phlegrean islands \u2013 is actually home to two distinct towns. At the eastern end lies the princess Capri Town where loafer-wearing VIPs sip espresso in Piazza Umberto I; the \u00a0faraglioni sea stacks winking in the distance. And at Capri's western end is her rugged little sister, the township of Anacapri; a sea cliff and prickly pear paradise where hiking boots replace stilettos and wild outdoorsy adventures trump wild nightlife.\nTip:\nWhile Anacapri remains the island's outdoorsy paradise, Capri Town does have a few woodsy experiences of its own. Just push past the tourists and strike out from Piazza Umberto I or Via Camerelle towards the Punta Tragara lookout and the passeggiata del Pizzolungo. This clifftop trek offers incredible views of the faraglioni, passing the Arco Naturale \u2013 a Neolithic arch \u2013 and the Grotta di Matermania, the site of pagan rituals to the Goddess Mitra. Reward yourself with lunch at Le Grottelle for rustic island dishes and mesmerising Gulf views.\nBut while Capri sees as many as 16,000 visitors a day \u2013 outnumbering the 12,900 full-time residents \u2013 the majority only visit Capri Town.\n\"There's two main reasons for this,\" surmises Camilla Formisano, copyeditor at Caprionline. \"Time and imagination. Seventy to 80% of visitors arrive on organised excursions from Naples, Sorrento or cruise ships. So they visit the most famous, easily accessible places from the port, like Piazza Umberto I.\"\nFormisano also believes that social media plays a part: \"People see the faraglioni and the piazza and think, 'I saw Capri'. Social media has condensed the island into a single postcard.\"\nSocial media is merely Capri Town's latest PR rep. Before becoming a premier Italian bucket list destination, Capri was a humble fishing island. It was settled by the Ancient Greeks, later becoming the seaside retreat of the Roman emperor Tiberius, who left grand villas in his wake. It wasn't until centuries later, when the Romantic poets and then Hollywood filmmakers turned their artistic eye on Capri Town, that it became a VIP haven. Today, visitors spill out from the ferry and throng the bus and funicular ticket booths to jockey for place in Piazza Umberto I, dodging motorised luggage carts and women in Instagrammable sundresses at every turn.\nMeanwhile, it's just a 15-minute bus ride to Anacapri, where respite from Capri Town's day-tripper crowds and inflated prices await.\n\"Anacapri isn't completely free of overtourism,\" admits Formisano, referencing the tourist crush at the Blue Grotto, Villa San Michele and the chairlift to Monte Solaro. \"But head west, through the Boffe [main] quarter towards the lighthouse and the Migliera [trail], and you'll find the island's heart.\"\nPlan your trip\nArrive:\u00a0Get to Anacapri via bus or taxi from Capri Town or Marina Grande. Download the ATC Go app to calculate bus routes and buy tickets.\nStay:\u00a0The Giardino dell\u2019Arte offers lovely rooms and a sprawling garden.\nEat:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Aumm Aumm Family-friendly restaurant serving excellent Neapolitan-style pizza.\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Il Riccio Sea Lounge Jumeirah Capri Palace's luxe beach restaurant at the Blue Grotto.\n\u2022\u00a0Ristorante La Zagara Restaurant inside a lemon grove. The neighbouring vinoteca offers gourmet aperitivi.\nAnacapri is crisscrossed by stone-walled paths that yield to sudden sea views; perfumed in springtime by blooming orange trees. The terrain is hilly; locals zip by me on scooters and dusty motorised three-wheeled buggies. One wrong turn and I find myself either wheezing up a steep incline or at the cliff's edge.\nDespite the divine aimlessness of wandering Anacapri on foot, its principal outdoor attractions are best reached with wheels. The ATC Capri Srl buses operate regularly between Piazza Vittoria, the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena, a craggy bay dominated by the island's rust-red 19th-Century lighthouse, where sunbathers splay themselves on the rocks or dive nose-first into the sea. Beach clubs are cut into the cliffs, the most beloved being da Antonio, a shack serving panini, gelato and an excellent crouton-and-aubergine panzanella salad. The upscale Lido del Faro features a pool and a full-service restaurant; I enjoy a bracing limoncello Spritz while watching the wild swimmers from above.\nBut Punta Carena is best known for its sunsets.\n\"It's the only place on Capri where the sun sets into the sea,\" says Formisano. \"Thanks to Capri's particular shape, Anacapri remains sun-kissed until sunset. Sunsets here are a special experience, casting a golden light that envelops the landscape.\"\nIt was Formisano who first directed me to the Trail of Little Forts. \"A must-see,\" she called it.\nTip:\nIf starting the Trail of Little Forts from the Blue Grotto, take the Anacapri-Grotta Azzurra bus from Piazza della Pace until the Orrico stop, then head to the Piazzetta di Orrico to start the trail. Allow approximately three hours to complete.\nThe medium-difficulty trail runs along Anacapri's western coast between the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena. It's possible to start the trail at either end, but most trekkers begin at the Blue Grotto.\n\"So you can walk calmly immersed in nature, have a swim in M\u00e8sola cove and get to the lighthouse by afternoon; just in time to enjoy an aperitif and the magnificent spectacle of the sunset over the sea,\" says Formisano.\nBack in the Boffe quarter, Piazza della Pace is the origin point for two other brilliant Anacapri hikes; the Migliera trail and Mount Solaro.\n\"The Migliera is a narrow road winding through the countryside,\" says Formisano. \"You'll come to a dramatic cliff overlook. Climb the ridge to the left; you'll get a really unique view of the faraglioni.\"\nHowever, the view from Mount Solaro \u2013 Capri's highest point \u2013 is arguably the island's most famous. The 13-minute chairlift up the 589m mountain provides unforgettable views of terraced vineyards with the Amalfi Coast winking in the distance.\nVertigo? Summit Mount Solaro on foot by following Via Axel Munthe to Via Salita per il Solaro, keeping an eye out for stray mountain goats.\nFor any Anacapri hike, wear trail shoes; not your new Capri leather sandals. Before setting off, \"stop at De Martino in Piazza Capri for an excellent panino\", advises Formisano.\nMost people reach Anacapri by bus, but if you're fit, consider tackling the 1.7km Scala Fenicia, a 921-step flight of stone stairs chiselled into the cliffs by the Ancient Greeks; allowing countless generations of hardy Capresi to travel between Capri and Anacapri.\n\"It's not for everyone,\" admits Pep Minichino, founder of the Gulf of Naples-based blog, Campanica. Nonetheless, he encourages visitors to \"embrace the experience! All you need is a Led Zeppelin anthem [in your head] for the energy to climb the famous zig-zag staircase.\"\nThe Scala Fenicia, which can be accessed from Marina Grande, leads straight up to Villa San Michele, the residence of the early 20th-Century Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. The sprawling mansion \u2013 built over Roman ruins, featuring grand sitting rooms and Neoclassical gardens \u2013 is Anacapri's most touristed museum. But I came to climb, and my heart rate thunders as I bypass the tourist hordes at Marina Grande to undertake the trek, surrounded by olive trees, terraced lemon groves and, finally at the top, the sea.\n\"La Scala Fenicia is also open at night, so you can go down step by step,\" says Minichino. \"Slowly. Aided in your descent by a cascade of lights and stars.\"\nBy far, Anacapri's most visited attraction is the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), famed for its magical blue phosphorescence. Chaotic overtourism has engulfed this natural phenomenon, and I am overwhelmed by the massive queue and dozens of tourist-packed boats bobbing outside the grotto. But, once inside, the azure-blue light is breathtaking, and I am comforted as the boat captain's serenade of O Sole Mio echoes through the cave.\nFormisano's hack: \"The best way to visit the Blue Grotto is to be on the entrance steps at 09:00, arriving by land from Anacapri, not by sea from Marina Grande,\" she says. \"This way you'll be first in line. You won't have to wait your turn on a rocking boat.\"\nBut to truly enjoy the seas of Anacapri, Formisano suggests doing as the Capresi do: \"Going down to the Blue Grotto, follow the signs for \"gradola\" to reach a small terrace overlooking the sea with an excellent restaurant, a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.\"\nMinichino agrees: \"The best swimming, diving and sunbathing in Anacapri.\"\n\"After a day of outdoor activities in Anacapri, the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in the town's authentic, peaceful atmosphere,\" says Formisano.\nMy B&B, Giardino dell'Arte, is no sumptuous 19th-Century Capri Town palazzo, but my tidy room is floored with blue and white ceramic tiles, and orange blossoms spill over the wooden door. The courtyard overlooks a garden and the innkeeper offers me homemade ravioli alla Caprese; round ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs.\nStrolling deeper into the Boffe quarter, I come upon La Casa Rossa, a bright red mansion built by the American colonel John Clay MacKowen in the early 20th Century; a quirky blend of architectural styles ranging from medieval to Middle Eastern. There are generational bakeries in leaf-shaded alleys where I buy fistfuls of sour cherry pastries and pizzette.\nBut the neighbourhood stunner is the Chiesa Monumentale di San Michele Arcangelo, a petite Baroque church with a show-stopping majolica floor in ochres and blues depicting the Fall of Eden. The tiles can only be viewed from strategically positioned wooden boards or from the balcony above. Wide-mouthed crocodiles, lions and hooved Biblical beasts leer up at me, Adam and Eve at the centre of the fray.\nIt's my favourite view island\u2026 until the rooftops.\nBecause Anacapri is still Capri, just off the Boffe quarter there are two opulent hotels; Jumeirah Capri Palace and the historic Hotel Caesar Augustus, a palatial structure dating to 1850 whose clifftop terrace seems to extend into the sea. I charm my way into both, and wind up on their rooftop bars as the sun sinks pink and purple into the Gulf of Naples, throwing Ischia and Procida into bas relief. Another limoncello Spritz, and I sink into a luxurious armchair, crossing my dusty ankles in their hiking boots; princess and athlete all at once.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the \"capture\" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\".\nHe did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that \"they will not enter and come out\".\nThe cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.\nThe UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.\nA Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's \"pressure and blackmail\".\nAsked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there.\nThe UK meanwhile said it \"does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\". The EU earlier urged restraint, saying it was concerned about \"further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population\".\n\nIsrael's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March.\nAn Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to \"defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages\".\n\"The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,\" the official said.\nIsraeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated \"buffer zone\" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nLater, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. \nFar-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was \"going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip\", according to Reuters news agency.\nIsrael occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline.\nIn a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued. \nHowever, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was \"choosing territories over the hostages\" and that this was \"against the will of over 70% of the people\" in Israel.\nHamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including \"a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides\".\nPalestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes.\n\"In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,\" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said.\n\"We lived through unbearable conditions in what Israel claimed was a 'safe zone' in the south. This time, we will not leave, even if Israel brings down the tents over our heads.\"\nOsama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: \"Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.\"\nThe Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority \"the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities\".\nThe security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a \"sterile area\" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection.\nOn Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to \"shut down the existing aid distribution system\" and \"have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\".\nThe HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies.\n\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy,\" it said.\n\"It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.\"\nIsrael cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive.\nAccording to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies.\nThe blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system.\nThe UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 52,567 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,459 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "In his 1983 science fiction story, an Indian astrophysicist predicted what schools would look like in 2050. \nJayant Narlikar envisioned a scene where an alien, living among humans, would sit in front of a screen and attend online classes. The aliens are yet to manifest, but online classes became a reality for students far sooner, in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\nNarlikar also famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang Theory - the popular idea that the universe was created in a single moment from a single point. He believed that the universe had always existed, expanding continuously into infinity.\nWith his passing on Tuesday, India lost one of its most celebrated astrophysicists. Narlikar was 86 - a man far ahead of his times and someone who shaped a generation of Indian researchers through his lifelong dedication to science education.\nHis funeral was attended by hundreds, from school children to renowned scientists and even his housekeeping staff, underscoring the profound impact he had on society.\nBorn on 19 July, 1938, in the town of Kolhapur in the western state of Maharashtra, Narlikar was raised in a home steeped in academic tradition. \nHis father, Vishnu Narlikar, was a professor and mathematician, and mother Sumati was a scholar of the Sanskrit language.\nFollowing in his parents footsteps, the studious Narlikar went to Cambridge University for higher studies where topped a highly prestigious mathematical course. He also took a deep interest in astrophysics and cosmology.\nBut his most significant episode at Cambridge was his association with his PhD guide, physicist Sir Fred Hoyle. Together, Narlikar and Hoyle laid the groundwork for a revolutionary alternative to the popular Big Bang theory.\nThe two physicists contested the Big Bang Theory, which posits that all matter and energy in the universe came into existence in one single instance about 13.8 billion years ago.\nThe Hoyle-Narlikar theory boldly proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe. Their theory was based on what they called a quasi-steady state model.\nIn his autobiography, My Tale of Four Cities, Narlikar used a banking analogy to explain the theory. \n\"To understand this concept better, think of capital invested in a bank which offers a fixed rate of compound interest. That is, the interest accrued is constantly added to the capital which therefore grows too, along with the interest.\" \nHe explained that the universe expanded like the capital with compound interest. However, as the name 'steady state' implies, the universe always looks the same to the observer.\nAstronomer Somak Raychaudhury says that though Narlikar's theory isn't as popular as the Big Bang, it is still useful.\n\"He advanced mechanisms by which matter could be continually created and destroyed in an infinite universe,\" Raychaudhary said. \n\"While the Big Bang model gained broader acceptance, many tools developed for the steady-state model remain useful today,\" he added\nRaychaudhary recollects that even after Hoyle began to entertain elements of the Big Bang theory, Narlikar remained committed to the steady-state theory. \nA sign outside his office fittingly stated: \"The Big Bang is an exploding myth.\"\nNarlikar stayed in the UK till 1971 as a Fellow at King's College and a founding member of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy. \nAs he shot to global fame in the astrophysics circles, the science community in India took note of his achievements.\nIn 1972, he returned to India and immediately took charge of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the coveted Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, which he led it till 1989.\nBut his biggest contribution to India was the creation of an institution dedicated to cutting-edge research and the democratisation of science.\nThis dream materialised in 1988, when Narlikar, along with other distinguished scientists, founded the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune city in western India.\nFrom a modest 100sq ft room, IUCAA has gone on to become an internationally respected institution for astronomy and astrophysics. \nNarlikar served as its founder-director till 2003, and continued to be an emeritus professor after that.\nHe insisted that IUCAA should include programs aimed at school children and the general public. Monthly lectures, science camps, and workshops became regular events.\nRecalling Narlikar's vision for the institution, science educator Arvind Gupta says, \"He said PhD scholars don't fall from the sky, you must catch them young. He offered me a place to stay, told me to try running the children's science centre for six months, and I ended up staying 11 years. He gave me wings to fly.\"\nDespite being a prolific scholar who published over 300 research papers, Narlikar never confined himself to being just a scientist. He also authored many science fiction books that have been translated into multiple languages.\nThese stories were often grounded in scientific principles.\nIn a story called Virus, published in 2015, he envisioned a pandemic taking over the world; his 1986 book Waman Parat Na Ala (The Return of Vaman), tackled the ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence.\nSanjeev Dhurandhar, who was part of the Indian team that contributed to the physical detection of gravitational waves in 2015, recalled how Narlikar inspired him to attempt the unthinkable.\n\"He gave me a complex problem early in my research. After I struggled for a week, he solved it on the board in 15 minutes - not to show superiority, but to guide and inspire. His openness to gravitational waves was what gave me the courage to pursue it.\"\nA well-known rationalist, Narlikar also took it upon himself to challenge pseudoscience. In 2008, he co-authored a paper that challenged astrology using a statistical method.\nRaychaudhary said that his motivation to challenge pseudoscience came from the belief system of questioning everything that did not have a scientific basis. \nBut when it came to science, Narlikar believed in exploring the slimmest of possibilities.\nIn his last days, Narlikar continued doing what he loved most - replying to children's letters and writing about science on his blog.

        "article_text": "Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. \nThe city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. \nThree people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday.\nBengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. \nMany parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. \nThis is \"rare\" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. \nApart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. \nIn one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee.\nVideos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. \nAuthorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to \"rectify\" the situation. \n\"There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,\" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. \nBut officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. \n\"No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,\" a user wrote on X.\nAnnu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. \n\"Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,\" she said. \nItty, who works in public policy, says a \"lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits\", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. \nKarnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.\nThe BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, \u00a387.5m) for relief operations.\nThe state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.\n\"The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,\" Shivakumar said.\nFloods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.\nAnanda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused \"discomfort and inconvenience\" for businesses. \n\"Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,\" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure. \n",

        "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.\nHe believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.\nSir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"\nThe ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.\nA blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.\nA host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.\nToby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.\nThe film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.\nSir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"\nSince then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.\nOcean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.\nThe new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.\n\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.\nThe process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.  \nSir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".\nSir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.\nIt is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.\nJust one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"\nBut in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.\nOne of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"\nDespite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"\nSir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.\nHe believes that could be transformational. \n\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"\nA healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.\n\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.\nAs he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.\nOcean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India Company gradually transformed into a colonial power. \nBy the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, Company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling.\nA Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by DAG, an art gallery in Delhi, features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of Company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists.\nPainted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs.\n\"The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes,\" says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show.\n\"Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them,  and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met \u2013 or at least observed \u2013 multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but \u2013 as they began to discern \u2013 were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice.\"\nBeyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. \nBefore photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists.\nBeyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb.\nThe once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. \nFrom June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)\nThe largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). \nWhile Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it.\nOriginally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801.\n\"The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century,\" writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. \n\"These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected.\"\nAnother painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. \nAt the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. \nLabeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.\nBy the late 18th Century, Company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. \nArt historian Mildred Archer called them a \"fascinating record of Indian social life,\" blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. \nRegional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers.\n\"They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life,\" says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.\nMost studies of Company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. \nA striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800.\nOne painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue.\nAmong the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting  boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats.\nWith no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.\nCompany paintings often featured natural history studies, portraying birds, animals, and plants - especially from private menageries. \nAs seen in the DAG show, these subjects are typically shown life-size against plain white backgrounds, with minimal surroundings - just the occasional patch of grass. The focus remains firmly on the species itself.\nAshish Anand, CEO of DAG, says the the latest show proposes Company paintings as the \"starting point of Indian modernism\".\nAnand says this \"was the moment when Indian artists who had trained in courtly ateliers first moved outside the court (and the temple) to work for new patrons\". \n\"The agendas of those patrons were not tied up with courtly or religious concerns; they were founded on scientific enquiry and observation,\" he says. \n\"Never mind that the patrons were foreigners. What should strike us now is how Indian artists responded to their demands, creating entirely new templates of Indian art.\"",

        "article_text": "The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.\nOn Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.\nPakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.\nAs Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.\n\"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.\nSince Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.\nPakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.  \nLaser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement. \nDrones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek.\nExperts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.\nThe Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft). \nWhile many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities. \nIndia is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.\nPakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.\nHe said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities. \nMr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.\nProf Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\".\nWhile the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.\n\"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.\nEjaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\". \n\"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.\n\nWhile drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.\n\"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi.\n\"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\"\nClearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.\n\"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek.\n\"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\" ",

Until today's tragic Air India crash in Ahmedabad, the model was a mainstay of intercontinental travel and had an exemplary safety record.\nThis is a different plane from the Boeing 737 Max, which was in the headlines after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed hundreds of people in 2018 and 2019 respectively. \nA software fault was found to have caused those incidents and the model was grounded worldwide for 18 months.\nSo far, there is nothing to suggest any fault on Boeing's side today in India. A much fuller picture will come once the plane's black boxes - the electronic recording devices that store vital flight information - have been recovered.\nVarious theories have been posited as to what could have caused the crash in Ahmedabad, but one pilot I spoke to said that nowadays it's rare for a manufacturer fault to cause a fatal incident. \nBarring the very notable exception of the Boeing 737 Max crashes, he said, most were down to human error in the cockpit.\nIt's also important to remember that when you fly commercially, you will almost always either be on a Boeing or an Airbus model as the plane-making industry operates as an effective duopoly.\nEven so, Boeing has found its name associated with yet another tragic aviation incident.\nChief executive Kelly Ortberg said the firm's \"deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of the passengers and crew\" on the flight, and that Boeing would support the investigation into the crash led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.\nWhen stock markets closed in New York on Thursday, Boeing shares were down nearly 5%.\nThe tragedy is another problem for a firm that lost nearly a billion dollars a month last year, as it grappled with a safety crisis, quality control issues, as well as a damaging workers' strike which lasted seven weeks. \nAfter one of its doors flew off midway through an Alaska Airlines flight in 2024, Boeing was forced to pay $160m (\u00a3126m) in compensation. \nBefore that, the company also reached a $428m settlement with Southwest Airlines for the financial damages caused by the long-term grounding of its 737 Max fleet.\nIn addition to severe financial issues, Boeing has faced serious questions over its safety practices. In April, the company said it had seen \"improved operational performance\" from \"our ongoing focus on safety and quality\".\nIn 2019, a former employee told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. \nJohn Barnett, who worked as a quality control manager during his more than 30 years at Boeing, took his own life in March last year. Boeing denied his assertions.\nAnother whistleblower, engineer Sam Salehpour, told US politicians that he was harassed and threatened after he raised concerns about the safety of Boeing's planes. \nBoeing said retaliation was \"strictly prohibited\" and it had seen a \"more than 500% increase\" in reports from employees since January, \"which signals progress toward a robust reporting culture that is not fearful of retaliation\".\nBoeing has also been embroiled in a series of legal battles related to the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last month, the firm narrowly avoiding criminal prosecution by coming to an agreement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ).\nTo the dismay of victims' families, the DoJ said Boeing would admit to \"conspiracy to obstruct and impede\" an investigation by the US Federal Aviation Administration and would pay more than $1.1bn in fines.\nUnsurprisingly, Boeing's top executive team has undergone a pretty significant shake-up over the past couple of years. \nIts new boss, Kelly Ortberg, came out of retirement a year ago to try to revive the ailing company. \nHe has promised an improvement to Boeing's safety culture and recently said he was confident the aviation giant would soon return to profitability.\nToday he faces more awful news to navigate.",

        "article_text": "Indian writer, lawyer and activist Banu Mushtaq has made history by becoming the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker prize with her short story anthology, Heart Lamp.\nIt is the first short story collection to win the presigious prize. Judges praised her characters as \"astonishing portraits of survival and resilience\".\nFeaturing 12 short stories written by Mushtaq between 1990 and 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.\nThe stories were selected and translated into English from Kannada, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, by Deepa Bhasthi who will share the \u00a350,000 prize. \nIn her acceptance speech, Mushtaq thanked readers for letting her words wander into their hearts.\n\"This book was born from the belief that no story is ever small; that in the tapestry of human experience, every thread holds the weight of the whole,\" she said.\n\"In a world that often tries to divide us, literature remains one of the last sacred spaces where we can live inside each other's minds, if only for a few pages,\" she added.\nBhasthi, who became the first Indian translator to win an International Booker, said that she hoped that the win would encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.\nManasi Subramaniam, Editor-in-chief of Penguin India, the book's publisher in India, told the BBC that the award was a significant win for regional literature.\n\"Following Tomb of Sand's landmark win in 2022 [Geetanjali Shree's book was translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell], Heart Lamp's triumph this year is a powerful reminder that literature in India's many languages demands our full attention. We owe it our ears,\" said Subramaniam\nMushtaq's body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.\nIt is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plotlines.\n\"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.\nMushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school. \nBut her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada. \nMushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression. \nShe began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.\nIt would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.\nHer short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.\nIn an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".\nIn the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house. \nThen, a shocking act of defiance set her free.\n\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine.\nIn Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.\n\"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors \u2014 silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back \u2014 not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,\" according to a review of the book in The Indian Express newspaper. \nMushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism.\nAfter leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family.\nIn a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel. \nBut her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate.\nIn an interview to The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques. \nA fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband.\nBut these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty.\n\"I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,\" she told The Week magazine.\nOver the years Mushtaq's writings have won numerous prestigious local and national awards including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award.\nIn 2024, the translated English compilation of Mushtaq's five short story collections published between 1990 and 2012 - Haseena and Other Stories - won the PEN Translation Prize.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.\n\"Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,\" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. \n\"But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.\"\nShe had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. \nMoving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.\nLovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.\n\"Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,\" Lovina jokes. \"I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.\"\nSo she posted an open message on her Facebook account: \"Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?\"\nTo her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.\nShe quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.\n\"I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,\" she says. \"I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.\"\nLovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. \nAccording to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. \nIndians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.\nFollowing that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. \nShortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.\nLovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupra\u2060, Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. \nThey say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.\nThe community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. \nThey say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. \nA member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.\n\"The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,\" she says.\nBeyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. \nIn one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. \nNishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.\n\"The group was her first port of call,\" says Nishi. \"As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.\"\nAnother woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.\n\"I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,\" Priya says.\n\"Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused.\" \nSo she asked the group and they offered advice.\nPriya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.\n\"The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,\" says Priya. \"I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.\"\nThere has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. \nLovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.\n\"I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,\" says Lovina.\n\"I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.\"\nLovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. \nIt has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation.\nThe World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority.\nThe members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.\n\"We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,\" says Lovina. \"I think that's the biggest support system for us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The team said no further comment would be made and Oakes declined to comment when contacted.\nA source told BBC Sport that it was Oakes' decision to leave. Others said that it came as a surprise inside the team.\nOakes, who moved to Alpine from his Hitech team that competes in the junior categories, was widely considered within F1 to have little power at the team, with former Renault team boss Briatore the real controlling force.\nBriatore's controversial return to F1 as a team leader 15 years after he was found guilty of fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix as Renault team boss was orchestrated by Renault Group chief executive officer Luca de Meo in July last year. \nOakes' departure comes just a day after it emerged that Alpine were poised to drop Australian Jack Doohan after just six races this season and replace him with Argentine former Williams driver Franco Colapinto.\nOakes was appointed in July last year after Alpine, who are owned by Renault, removed their previous team principal Bruno Famin and placed him elsewhere in the company. \nAnd it continues a turbulent few years at the team that have seen a continuous flux in senior management amid a run of disappointing results for Renault's factory team. \nRenault also decided last year to end their F1 engine programme, which had been involved since 1977 with only a couple of brief breaks. Alpine will use Mercedes engines next season.\nFamin also lasted less than a year in his role as team boss after replacing Otmar Szafnauer in July 2023. The American lasted just 17 months.\nShortly before Szafnauer's departure, Alpine chief executive officer Laurent Rossi was also dismissed.

        "summary": "Team principal Oakes leaves Alpine after 10 monthsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oliver Oakes joined Alpine in July 2024Andrew BensonF1 CorrespondentPublished19 minutes agoAlpine team principal Oliver Oakes has left the team less than a year after being appointed to the role.A statement by Alpine on Tuesday said Oakes had resigned and that the team had \"accepted his resignation with immediate effect\".The team said Flavio Briatore would continue in his role as executive adviser and would now also cover the duties Oakes had performed.No explanation was given for Oakes' departure. Others said that it came as a surprise inside the team.Oakes, who moved to Alpine from his Hitech team that competes in the junior categories, was widely considered within F1 to have little power at the team, with former Renault team boss Briatore the real controlling force.Briatore's controversial return to F1 as a team leader 15 years after he was found guilty of fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix as Renault team boss was orchestrated by Renault Group chief executive officer Luca de Meo in July last year. Oakes' departure comes just a day after it emerged that Alpine were poised to drop Australian Jack Doohan after just six races this season and replace him with Argentine former Williams driver Franco Colapinto.Oakes was appointed in July last year after Alpine, who are owned by Renault, removed their previous team principal Bruno Famin and placed him elsewhere in the company. Alpine will use Mercedes engines next season.Famin also lasted less than a year in his role as team boss after replacing Otmar Szafnauer in July 2023. And it continues a turbulent few years at the team that have seen a continuous flux in senior management amid a run of disappointing results for Renault's factory team.",

        "article_text": "\"Who is responsible for this mess?\"\nThe question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated.\nHeavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours. \nEven a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral. \nThe pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\nFollowing criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late.\nThe crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai.\nFrom Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt.\nExperts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem. \n\"The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,\" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi.\n\"Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,\" he adds.\nExperts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses.\nIndia receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September.\nThe monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent.\nBut experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people.\nThis year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared. \n\"A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,\" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. \nIn Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding.\nThis year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department. \nMany residents reported damage to their property. \nAt least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports.\nMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same. \nOnce known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding.\n\"Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,\" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist.\nThese valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says. \n\"When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.\" \nMr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made.\nViolations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides.\nBut experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain.\n\"The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,\" Mr Kukerja says. \"Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience.\"\nThis isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more. \nOver the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way. \nSo, can anything be done to prevent this?\n\"Yes,\" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy.\nHe suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses.\n\"But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,\" he said.\nFor India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.\nThose in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi. \nOn Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US. \nLater, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\" \nThe Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.\nSeveral rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.\nThe latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.\nIndia blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.\nTrump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.\nThe two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.\nWhile US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.\n\"Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,\" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.\nIslamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.\n\"We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,\" a  foreign ministry statement said..\nDelhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.\nPresident Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to \"internationalise\" the Kashmir dispute.\nThe main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the \"ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first\".\n\"Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,\" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed \"to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site\". This has caught the Indians by surprise.\nDelhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.\nHistorically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they \"resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations\".\nIndian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.\nThe conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.\nBut Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.\"\nIt is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.\nThe view from Pakistan is different. \n\"Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,\" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.\n\"Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,\" Mr Gul says.\nPakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.\n\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.\nIndia's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.\nBut it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances. \nThe US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.\nThe previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds. \nThe US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.\nDelhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US. \nAny attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of.",

That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.\nMushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school. \nBut her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada. \nMushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression. \nShe began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.\nIt would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.\nHer short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.\nIn an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".\nIn the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house. \nThen, a shocking act of defiance set her free.\n\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine.\nIn Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.\n\"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors \u2014 silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back \u2014 not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,\" according to a review of the book in The Indian Express newspaper. \nMushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism.\nAfter leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family.\nIn a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel. \nBut her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate.\nIn an interview to The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques. \nA fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband.\nBut these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty.\n\"I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,\" she told The Week magazine.\nOver the years Mushtaq's writings have won numerous prestigious local and national awards including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award.\nIn 2024, the translated English compilation of Mushtaq's five short story collections published between 1990 and 2012 - Haseena and Other Stories - won the PEN Translation Prize.",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. \nAuthorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to \"rectify\" the situation. \n\"There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,\" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. \nBut officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. \n\"No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,\" a user wrote on X.\nAnnu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. \n\"Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,\" she said. \nItty, who works in public policy, says a \"lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits\", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. \nKarnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.\nThe BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, \u00a387.5m) for relief operations.\nThe state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.\n\"The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,\" Shivakumar said.\nFloods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.\nAnanda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused \"discomfort and inconvenience\" for businesses. \n\"Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,\" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure. \n",

In 2019, he transitioned to IndyCar, winning the Indy 500 in 2022.\u00a0\n(Credit: Andretti Global/ Alex Frick)\nIn 2019, former Formula One driver Marcus Ericsson\u00a0relocated from his native Sweden to Indianapolis to fully immerse himself in the tight-knit and high-powered IndyCar community. In \"the Racing Capital of the World\", Ericsson fills his days with exercising, exploring, biking, running trails and dining at the city's internationally inspired restaurants.\n\"We have fun sports with the Pacers and the Colts, and obviously the IMS [Indiana Motor Speedway] and now the new museum [the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum] which is amazing,\" says Ericsson. \"There are a lot of fun little places, like restaurants and bars as well. It's a really cool city to live in.\"\nHe adds: \"People are very friendly and very open. So, for me, it felt like home very quickly.\"\nHere are Ericsson's favourite ways to experience Indianapolis.\u00a0\nIndianapolis has plenty of famous foods, like the spicy shrimp cocktail at St Elmo Steak House or the widely available pork tenderloin sandwich. For a sampling of Indianapolis' dining scene, Ericsson recommends exploring Massachusetts Avenue, a mile-long street running diagonally into downtown, lined with lively bars and restaurants. \"Ericsson and his wife love going out for dinner at Modita, an Asian fusion eatery. Located in the Bottleworks Hotel, an Art Deco boutique hotel that was once the country's largest Coca-Cola bottling plant, Modita's menu is infused with the same spirit of reinvention. Executive Chef Megan Stoller draws inspiration from several Asian food cultures to reimagine classic dishes like sushi and dim sum. Ericsson's recommendation: \"Get the bao buns, they're very, very good. I always get them every time I go.\"\u00a0\nIf you want to get out of the city centre, Ericsson suggests heading to Broad Ripple, an eclectic neighbourhood just north of downtown, where you can unwind over Neapolitan-style pizza at Diavola.\nWebsite: https://www.modita.com/\u00a0\nAddress: 850 Massachusetts Ave., Suite 110, Indianapolis, IN 46204\nPhone: 317-316-0470\nInstagram:\u00a0@modita.restaurant\n\n\"As a race car driver, I always have to stay active to be fit to drive. And that's a big part of my life. I need to be outdoors and be healthy,\" Ericsson says. \"One thing that I love about Indianapolis is that we have something called the Monon Trail, which is a trail from downtown Indianapolis all the way up to north of Indianapolis.\nTip\nIf you're attending the Indy 500, keep in mind that there's more to do than simply watch on race day. \"Something that's very famous with the Indianapolis 500 is called Carb Day (23 May this year), which is the last practice session that always runs on the Friday before the race,\" says Ericsson. \"There are always concerts on the track combined with the last practice, so it's like a big party.\"\u00a0\n\"You can jump on that trail from everywhere in the city. People spend a lot of time walking or cycling there, so it's always super busy and is a great way to stay active,\" says Ericsson.\u00a0\nThe trail began as a railroad line linking to Chicago and Louisville; today, it's a popular 41km biking and walking trail. Extending from the northern suburbs into the heart of Indianapolis, where it connects to the Indianapolis Cultural Trail and the north end of Massachusetts Avenue, the trail winds through the city's central neighbourhoods past popular wine bars and cafes.\nTo explore a little further out of the city, Ericsson ventures 20 minutes north of Indianapolis to Eagle Creek Park. \"Eagle Creek Park is the largest park in Indianapolis, and it has a reservoir and some pretty nice trails,\" he says. \"I go there in the summer, and you can rent a kayak or just walk around and get out in nature.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.bikethemonon.com/\nEricsson's top pick for a wow-worthy night on the town is Vida, a chef-driven establishment housed in an unpretentious building just off Massachusetts Avenue. Helmed by Indiana native Chef Thomas Melvin \u2013\u00a0a 2024 James Beard Award semifinalist for Best Chef: Great Lakes \u2013 Vida is known for its multi-course menu of artfully plated dishes prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients from local farms. Guests can observe the chefs in the open kitchen, which is framed by a hydroponic \"green wall\" that supplies fresh herbs. Ericsson says that because the menu changes almost daily, he never quite knows what to expect when dining there. But the ambiance and service remain the same, with the crackle of a double-sided fireplace casting a warm glow and the impressive wine vault inviting guests to sip something special.\u00a0\n\"My wife and I are kind of foodies, and when we travel, we always like trying fine dining restaurants. Vida reminds me of the high-end, Michelin-star restaurants that we go to internationally,\" says Ericsson.\u00a0 \"We usually go there for special occasions, like Valentine's Day or birthdays.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.vida-restaurant.com/\u00a0\nAddress: 601 E New York St, Indianapolis, IN 46202\nPhone: 317-420-2323\nInstagram: @vida.restaurant\nSports culture doesn't totally revolve around IndyCar in Indianapolis. \"The Pacers basketball team is really fun to go and watch live at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse,\" says Ericsson. \"When my friends are in town, we try to go down and see them.\" Designed to reflect Indiana's rich basketball heritage, it's the home court for the NBA's Indiana Pacers and the WNBA's Indiana Fever. Beyond basketball, the venue hosts big-name concerts, college tournaments and other events, including the AT&T WNBA All-Star 2025 Game in July.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite: http://www.gainbridgefieldhouse.com/\u00a0\nAddress: 125 S Pennsylvania St., Indianapolis, IN 46204\nPhone: 317-917-2727\nInstagram: @gainbridgefieldhouse\nIndianapolis has many cultural landmarks that explore artistry and achievement from different perspectives. In downtown Indianapolis, the esteemed Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art houses one of the most celebrated collections of Native American artworks, and the Soldiers and Sailors monument honours Indianians who've served from the Revolutionary War to the Spanish-American War. But one of the city's most recognisable cultural attractions is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum which preserves and interprets the history of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home to the legendary Indianapolis 500 \u2013 the world's largest single-day sporting event.\nAfter a 17-month renovation, the museum reopened in April 2025 intending to make the history and culture of racing more accessible to non-fans intrigued by the racetrack. But even for racing experts like Ericsson, the museum is a thrilling experience.\u00a0\n\"I recently went to the reopening of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum which they just put like, $60m (\u00a345.6m) into updating to make it a state-of-the-art museum,\" says Ericsson. \"I was blown away when I went there \u2013\u00a0it's really helpful to understand 100 years of history and gives you an idea of how the Indy 500 became so big and popular.\"\nLocated in the centre of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway racetrack, the museum honours more than a century of racing history. The Speedway itself, a 4km track built in 1909, is a National Historic Landmark, and daily tours allow guests to get an in-depth look at the history and significance of this sporting venue. What began with a collection of just 12 race cars has grown into one of the world's most famous motorsports collections, now featuring more than 150 vehicles and thousands of other racing artefacts. One of the museum's highlights is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame, which honours legends of racing like Wilbur Shaw, AJ Foyt and Janet Guthrie.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite: https://imsmuseum.org/\nAddress: 4750 W 16th St., Indianapolis, IN 46222\nPhone: 463-244-2680\nInstagram: @imsmuseum\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Grip strength is associated with a range of health outcomes, from type 2 diabetes to depression. Here\u2019s how to check yours.\nIn a world of technologically-driven longevity clinics with their increasingly sophisticated imaging scans, some of which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, it turns out that one of the best assessments of muscle strength and quality is to simply sit in a chair and squeeze a tennis ball.\u00a0\nThat's the recommendation offered by Joshua Davidson, a strength and conditioning researcher at the University of Derby who studies hand grip strength, a metric increasingly recognised as one of the most reliable markers of human health.\nWhen testing grip strength in clinical trials, scientists typically use a hand dynamometer, a device which you squeeze as hard as possible to measure the force generated by the muscles in your hand and forearm. Several companies are now attempting to take the dynamometer out of the clinic and into the home, combining easy-to-use devices with mobile apps to let anyone chart their grip strength over time.\nHowever, according to Davidson, you can still get a decent idea through a simple \"squeeze test\" with a tennis or stress ball. \"All you need is any object that you can grasp and can be deformed without causing pain or discomfort,\" he says. \"Simply squeeze it for as long as you can before your grip fatigues. Being able to maintain a maximal squeeze on something like a tennis ball for 15-30 seconds would be a good standard to strive for.\" Noting down how long you can squeeze can help you track your grip strength over time.\u00a0\nOf course, as Mark Peterson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation professor at the University of Michigan points out, having a weak grip strength alone will have relatively little impact on your everyday life directly, beyond making it a little bit harder to open cans or jars. But researchers are increasingly using grip strength as a proxy for overall musculoskeletal strength throughout the body. It can reflect whether a person is active enough or too sedentary and indicate their risk of frailty \u2013 the condition of being vulnerable as a result of a decline in one's physiological health.\nThis first came to scientists' attention through a particularly notable study of nearly 140,000 adults across high, middle and low-income countries which found grip strength was a better predictor for premature death than other more obvious indicators such as blood pressure.\nOther research has revealed that a person's grip strength can indicate their likelihood of living past 100. In one study, volunteers had their grip strengths measured in 1965-1968, when they were between 56 and 68 years old, and their survival was tracked for the next 44 years. Those who became centenarians were 2.5 times more likely to have had grip strength results in the highest third, compared to those who died before the age of 79.\u00a0\u00a0\nDarryl Leong, an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Canada, explains that your handgrip strength \u2013 and therefore your overall muscular strength \u2013 is a sum of your nutrition, physical activity and whether you have any illnesses. \"This is the reason it's associated with so many health outcomes,\" he says.\nOne study which used dynamometer testing found that grip strength scores of less than 25.5 kilograms for men and 18 kilograms for women suggests a heightened risk of sarcopenia throughout the body, the progressive loss of muscle mass and function which is linked to decreased strength and mobility in later life, and a greater likelihood of falling and developing fractures.\nGuillaume Par\u00e9, a practising physician and a professor of medicine at McMaster University, says that it's possible to tell a lot even from a simple handshake, with grip strength serving as a marker for whether someone is likely to have sarcopenia. \"Weaker handshakes where fingers struggle to close completely around my hand, or where hand muscles are emaciated, are red flags,\" he says.\nBut the links between grip strength and longevity go well beyond physical capabilities. Studies have shown that muscle is a key player in the metabolic system, acting as a reservoir which can soak up excess blood glucose and help prevent the development of insulin resistance. Because of this, a weaker grip can indicate that a person is more prone to a plethora of problems linked to metabolic dysfunction, ranging from type 2 diabetes to lower bone mineral density, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and depression.\nIf you do have a dynamometer to hand, you can use the chart above to compare your grip strength against. The results were taken from a study on the average grip strength measurements for healthy people in each sex across different age groups.\nBack in 2022, Peterson led a study which assessed the grip strength of 1,275 men and women and compared these results to an analysis of their DNA. The team found that those with lower grip strength scores showed signs of accelerated ageing. Specifically, they had differences in their DNA methylation patterns \u2013 tags associated with our DNA which can alter the way it is read over our lifetimes. Methylation patterns often change in response to environmental or lifestyle factors, such as obesity, pollution or even social stress, among many other things.\nWrist curls: Improve your grip strength\nBegin by sitting with your arms on your lap. Grip a can in your hand, with your palm facing upwards. Then slowly bring the can upwards towards your body, without moving your arm. Hold it there for a second, and carefully lower it back down. With practise, aim to build up to doing five sets of 20 repetitions.\nFor Par\u00e9 this is unsurprising, as he says he sees grip strength as a key marker of both disease resilience and likelihood of recovering from chronic illnesses. For example, research in cancer patients shows that those with poorer grip strength are more likely to experience sudden weight loss or cachexia \u2013 extreme muscle or fat loss, despite eating normally \u2013 and thus worse prognosis and survival outcomes.\n\"It means that once we have a disease, our ability to fight it is limited,\" says Peterson. \"For example, the risk of dying from a pneumonia is much increased in individuals with lower grip strength, which makes sense considering the importance of good muscular health to properly clear the airways of sputum [the saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract as a result of infections].\"\nGrip strength isn't just something to be aware of in later life, either. Researchers have even found that the average grip strength of a population tends to correlate with how many medals a country is likely to win at the Olympic Games. Meanwhile, Par\u00e9 says that teenagers and young adults who have poorer grip strength are likely to be more prone to health issues at an earlier age. One study in Brazil showed that teenagers who spent more time on their screens, either on their phones or other devices, tended to have worse grip strength.\n\"There's data supporting the association of low grip strength with poor metabolic health even in young adults,\" says Par\u00e9.\nSo, can we improve our grip strength? Certainly, says Davidson, and it's something which you can work on irrespective of your age. He suggests simply using the tennis ball test to progressively work the muscles of your hand and forehand to contract at maximal power for as long as you can. With practise, you should see steady improvements over time, he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Sit-to-stand: The simple test that reveals how you're ageing\n\u2022 The ruler drop test: Check your reaction times\n\u2022 What your fingernails can reveal about your health\u00a0\nIt also isn't just about grip. Leong recommends working on being more physically active in general and training the muscles in your lower and upper body. If you do this, he says your grip strength will improve accordingly.\u00a0\nFor older adults, Leong suggests trying the timed get-up-and-go test. \"Here, the individual records with a stopwatch, the time taken to rise from a chair, walk three metres, turn around and return to the seated position,\" says Leong. \"This is a test of lower limb strength and mobility and will help improve your total muscle strength.\"\nDavidson says that general resistance exercises to improve muscle mass and maintain bone mineral density will lead to improvements in grip strength. \"We all need to engage in regular physical activity as we age,\" he says. \"You can work out at home either using specialist equipment or just things you have around the house. Two to three sets of single arm wrist curls, with reps of between 10 and 20, is a good exercise to start with. If you have a kettlebell at home, bicep curls are also good exercises to try.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory \u2013 but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.\nThe latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called \"terrorist infrastructure\" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.\nMany of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.\nAfter India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.\nIndia reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance. \nIslamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.\n\"Losses are a part of combat,\" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets. \n\"We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,\" he added.\nIndia said it had killed at least \"100 terrorists\" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.\nA definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.\nA Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.\nSome of the experts have called this a \"DeepSeek moment\" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.\n\"The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,\" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.\nThe Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed \"China has some systems that are next to none\". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.\nOther experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.\nProfessor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.\n\"In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,\" he said.\nMr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.\nBeijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.\nCarlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.\n\"At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,\" she said.\nFor China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (\u00a337bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.\nSo, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.\nChina made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. \"It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,\" he said.\nExperts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.\nChina sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.\nReports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets \u2013 jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 \u2013 due to technical malfunctions.\nThe Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.\nAnother point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.\nIn 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later. \nIndia, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.\nDespite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an \"impressive breadth of targets\" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.\nThe Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.\nOne of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.\nMr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets. \nThe Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.\n\"It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,\" Mr Ladwig pointed out.\nNevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military \"lost control of the narrative thread\".\nIn response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.\nRealising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.\nBut for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.\nBeijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.\nDelhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.\nIndia and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.\nExperts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.\nFor now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

At the far end of the room, people have gathered to inspect a huge hole in the wall apparently caused by the impact of the plane.\nOne woman at the scene told ANI that her son jumped from the second floor of the hostel, sustaining injuries, when the plane crashed there.\nVerified footage taken in central Ahmedabad showed huge plumes of black smoke in the sky.\nThe BBC's Roxy Gagdekar said people near the scene were running to \"save as many lives as possible\". \nHe said emergency services were involved in a rescue operation and trying to extinguish a fire, and described seeing bodies being taken from the area.\nIndian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a press briefing that \"we have lost a lot of people\".\nAir India later issued a statement confirming 241 people on board the plane had been killed.

        "article_text": "For Maria Khan, the ceasefire this weekend between India and Pakistan came too late.\nMaria, who lives in Indian-administered Kashmir, lost her nephew and niece - 12-year-old twins Zain Ali and Urwa Fatima - to cross-border shelling on 7 May. Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.\nHours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\nThe strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.\nPeople living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.\nMaria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.\nIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,\" Maria says.\nShe adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border. Are we not humans?\" she asks.\n\"Now, whether there is a war or ceasefire, our children will not come back.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook\nALSO READ:",

Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.Hours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.The strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.People living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.Maria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.Maria KhanA photo of the twins celebrating their birthdayIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.On 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.Rameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.After the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. \"Now, whether there is a war or ceasefire, our children will not come back. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.On 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.It wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.Terrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of meters into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Islamabad has strongly denied backing the group in question.\nThe US-brokered ceasefire agreed between the nuclear-armed neighbours at the weekend appears to have held so far.\nBoth nations say they remain vigilant.\n\"If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given,\" Modi said in his speech on Monday. \n\"Terror and trade talks cannot happen together,\" he remarked. This was most likely a reference to comments from US President Donald Trump, who said he had told India and Pakistan his administration would only trade with them if they end the conflict.\n\"Water and blood cannot flow together,\" Modi added, this time referring to the suspension of a water treaty between India and Pakistan. \nHis comments come after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that his country had \"acted as a responsible state\", adding: \"Our honour, our dignity and our self-respect are more precious to us than our lives.\"\nHe said he believed the water issue with India would be resolved through peaceful negotiations.\nEarlier on Monday, top military officials from India and Pakistan discussed finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them over the weekend.\nAccording to the Indian army, the two sides spoke about the need to refrain from any aggressive action. \n\"It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,\" it said in a statement. \nIndia also announced it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns.\nThe recent tensions were the latest in the decades-long rivalry between India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over Kashmir, a Himalayan region which they claim in full but administer in part.\nThe hostilities threatened to turn into a fully-fledged war as they appeared unwilling to back down for days.\nBoth countries have said that dozens of people from both sides died over the four days of fighting last week, partly due to heavy shelling near the de facto border.\nAnnouncing the ceasefire on Saturday, Trump said \"it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much\".\nBoth India and Pakistan declared military victory after it came into effect.\nOn 7 May, India reported striking nine targets inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to the 22 April deadly militant attack in the picturesque Pahalgam valley. \nIn the days after the first strike, India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border shelling and claimed to have shot down rival drones and aircraft in their airspace.\nAs the conflict escalated, both nations said they had struck the rival's military bases.\nIndian officials reported striking 11 Pakistan Air Force bases, including one in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad. India also claimed Pakistan lost 35-40 men at the Line of Control - the de facto border - during the conflict and that its air force lost a few aircraft.\nPakistan has accepted that some Indian projectiles landed at its air force bases.\nIndian defence forces have also said that they struck nine armed group training facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing more than 100 militants.\nThe Pakistan military, in turn, claims it targeted about 26 military facilities in India and that its drones hovered over the capital, Delhi.\nIndia has confirmed that some Pakistani projectiles landed up at its air force bases, though it did not comment on the claim about Delhi.\nPakistan also claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft, including three French Rafales - India has not acknowledged this or commented on the number, though it said on Sunday that \"losses are a part of combat\".\nPakistan denied the claims that an Indian pilot was in its custody after she ejected following an aircraft crash.

        "article_text": "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\". \nThe strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.\nPakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. \nIslamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. \nThis sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.  \nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nExperts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.\nIndia says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. \nAmong the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. \nThe deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. \nPakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.\n\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.  \n\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.\nThe India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.\nAjay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".\n\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nIndian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".\n\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.\n\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\" \nThe majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.\n\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.\n\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"\nPakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".\nDr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.\n\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".\nChristopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.\n\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.  \n\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.\nDespite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.\n\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.\nHowever, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.\nExperts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.\n\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.\n\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"\nDr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.\n\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.\n\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.\n\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"\nIndia is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. \nShortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.\nThis mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. \nThe crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week.",

        "article_text": "It was a killing that shocked India: Punjabi hip-hop star Sidhu Moose Wala shot dead through the windscreen of his car by hired gunmen.\nWithin hours, a Punjabi gangster named Goldy Brar had used Facebook to claim responsibility for ordering the hit.\nBut three years after the murder, no-one has faced trial - and Goldy Brar is still on the run, his whereabouts unknown.\nNow, BBC Eye has managed to make contact with Brar and challenged him about how and why Sidhu Moose Wala became a target.\nHis response was coldly articulate.\n\"In his arrogance, he [Moose Wala] made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,\"  Brar told the BBC World Service.\n\"We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that.\"\nOn a warm May evening in 2022, Sidhu Moose Wala was taking his black Mahindra Thar SUV for its usual spin through dusty lanes near his village in the northern Indian state of Punjab when, within minutes, two cars began tailing him.\nCCTV footage later showed them weaving through narrow turns, sticking close. Then, at a bend in the road, one of the vehicles lurched forward, cornering Moose Wala's SUV against a wall. He was trapped. Moments later, the shooting began.\nMobile footage captured the aftermath. His SUV was riddled with bullets, the windscreen shattered, the bonnet punctured.\nIn trembling voices, bystanders expressed their shock and concern.\n\"Someone get him out of the car.\"\n\"Get some water.\"\n\"Moose Wala has been shot.\"\nBut it was too late. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital - hit by 24 bullets, a post-mortem would later reveal. The 28-year-old rapper, one of modern-day Punjab's biggest cultural icons, had been gunned down in broad daylight.\nOutside the UK, watch on YouTube, or listen on BBC.com\nA cousin and a friend who had been in the car with Moose Wala at the time of the ambush were injured, but survived.\nSix gunmen were eventually identified. They carried AK-47s and pistols. In the weeks that followed the murder, about 30 people were arrested and two of the suspected armed men were killed in what the Indian police described as \"encounters\".\nYet even with arrests piling up, the motive remained murky.\nGoldy Brar, who claims to have ordered the hit, wasn't in India at the time of the killing. He is believed to have been in Canada.\nOur conversation with him unfolded over six hours, pieced together through an exchange of voice notes. It gave us a chance to find out why Moose Wala had been killed and to interrogate the motives of the man who claimed responsibility.\nSidhu Moose Wala was born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu in a Jat-Sikh family in rural Punjab, before moving in 2016 to Canada to study engineering - a journey familiar to hundreds of thousands in the Punjabi diaspora.\nBut it was there, far from his village of Moosa - the inspiration for his rap name - that he reinvented himself as one of Punjabi music's most influential artists. In just five years, Moose Wala became the unmistakable voice of Punjabi hip-hop.\nWith his signature swagger, flashy style, and lyrical grit, Moose Wala sang openly about identity and politics, guns and revenge, pushing the boundaries of what Punjabi music had been willing to say.\nHe was fascinated by rapper Tupac Shakur, who had been murdered, aged 25, in 1996. \"In terms of personality, I want to be like him,\" Moose Wala once told an interviewer. \"The day he died, people cried for him. I want the same. When I die, people should remember that I was someone.\"\nOver a brief but explosive career, the singer spotlighted the darker undercurrents of India's Punjab region - gangster culture, unemployment, and political decay - while evoking a deep nostalgia for village life.\nMoose Wala was also a global force. With more than five billion views of his music videos on YouTube, a Top 5 spot in the UK charts, and collaborations with international hip-hop artists including Burna Boy, Moose Wala swiftly built a fan base stretching across India, Canada, the UK and beyond, powered by a diaspora that saw him as both icon and insurgent.\nBut fame came at a cost. Despite his rising star and socially conscious lyrics, Moose Wala was drifting into dangerous territory. His defiant attitude, visibility, and growing influence had drawn the attention of Punjab's most feared gangsters. These included Goldy Brar, and Brar's friend Lawrence Bishnoi, who even then was in a high-security jail in India.\nNot much is known about Brar, apart from the fact he is on the Interpol Red Notice list, and is a key operative in a network of gangsters operated by Bishnoi \u2013 orchestrating hits, issuing threats and amplifying the gang's reach. It is thought he emigrated to Canada in 2017, just a year after Moose Wala himself, and initially worked as a truck driver.\nBishnoi, once a student leader steeped in Punjab's violent campus politics, has grown into one of India's most feared criminal masterminds.\n\"The first [police] cases filed against Lawrence Bishnoi were all related to student politics and student elections\u2026 beating a rival student leader, kidnapping him, harming him,\" according to Jupinderjit Singh, deputy editor of Indian newspaper the Tribune.\nThis led to a spell in jail which hardened him further, says Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, Assistant Inspector General of the Anti-Gangster Task Force of Punjab Police.\n\"Once he was in jail, he started to get deeper into crime. Then he formed a group of his own. When it became an inter-gang thing, he needed money for survival. They need more manpower, they need more weapons. They need money for all that. So, for money, you have to get into extortion or crime.\"\nNow 31, Bishnoi runs his syndicate from behind bars - with dedicated Instagram pages and a cult-like following.\n\"So while Bishnoi sits in jail, Brar handles the gangs,\" says Assistant Inspector General Chauhan.\nSecuring BBC Eye's exchange with Brar took a year of chasing - cultivating sources, waiting for replies, gradually getting closer to the kingpin himself. But when we got through to Brar, the conversation cast new light on the question of how and why he and Bishnoi came to see Moose Wala as an enemy.\nOne of the first revelations was that Bishnoi's relationship with Moose Wala went back several years, long before the singer's killing.\n\"Lawrence [Bishnoi] was in touch with Sidhu [Moose Wala]. I don't know who introduced them, and I never asked. But they did speak,\" said Brar.\n\"Sidhu used to send 'good morning' and 'good night' messages in an effort to flatter Lawrence.\"\nA friend of Moose Wala's, who spoke anonymously, also told us that Bishnoi had been in touch with Moose Wala as early as 2018, calling him from jail and telling him he liked his music.\nBrar told us that the \"first dispute\" between them came after Moose Wala had moved back to India. It began with a seemingly innocuous match of kabbadi - a traditional South Asian contact team sport - in a Punjabi village.\nMoose Wala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang - Brar told us, in a sport where match-fixing and gangster influence are rampant.\n\"That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\nYet the dispute between Moose Wala and Bishnoi was eventually resolved by an associate of Bishnoi's called Vicky Middhukhera.\nBut when Middukhera himself was gunned down by gangsters in a parking lot in Mohali in August 2021, Brar told us Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moose Wala reached the point of no return.\nThe Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moose Wala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moose Wala denied any involvement.\nThe Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moose Wala to the killing or to any gang-related crime. But Moose Wala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang - a perception that may have cost him his life.\nAlthough he can cite no proof of Moose Wala's involvement, Brar remains convinced that the singer was somehow complicit in the killing of Middukhera. Brar repeatedly told us that Shaganpreet Singh had assisted the gunmen in the days before Middukhera's shooting - and inferred that Moose Wala himself must have been involved.\n\"Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\n\"We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea.\n\"So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard.\"\nWe put it to Brar that India has a judicial system and the rule of law - how could he justify taking the law into his own hands?\n\"Law. Justice. There's no such thing,\" he says. \"Only the powerful can... [obtain] justice, not ordinary people like us.\"\nHe went on to say that even Vicky Middukhera's brother, despite being in politics, has struggled to get justice through India's judicial system.\n\"He's a clean guy. He tried hard to get justice for his brother lawfully. Please call him and ask how that's going.\"\nHe appeared unrepentant.\n\"I did what I had to do for my brother. \u202fI have no remorse whatsoever.\"\nThe killing of Moose Wala has not just resulted in the loss of a major musical talent, it has also emboldened Punjab's gangsters.\nBefore the singer's murder, few outside Punjab had heard of Bishnoi or Brar.\nAfter the killing, their names were everywhere. They hijacked Moose Wala's fame and converted it into their own brand of notoriety - a notoriety that became a powerful tool for extortion.\n\"This is the biggest killing that has happened in the last few decades in Punjab,\" says Ritesh Lakhi, a Punjab-based journalist. \"The capacity of gangsters to extort money has gone up. [Goldy Brar]'s getting huge sums of money after killing Moose Wala.\"\nJournalist Jupinderjit Singh agrees: \"The fear factor around gangsters has risen amongst the public.\" \nExtortion has long been a problem in the Punjabi music industry, but now after Sidhu's murder, Singh says: \"It's not just people in the music and film industry who are being extorted - even local businessmen are receiving calls.\"\nWhen BBC Eye quizzed Brar on this, he denied this was the motive, but did admit - in stark terms - that extortion was central to the gang's working.\n\"To feed a family of four a man has to struggle all his life. We have to look after hundreds or even thousands of people who are like family to us. We have to extort people.\n\"To get money,\" he says, \"we have to be feared.\"",

        "article_text": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.\nYet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.\nEven scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. \nSix years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. \nAs the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.\nPresident Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\n\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.\nIndia and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.\nThe bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \n\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.\nOne reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.\nSince testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. \nIndia, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.\nFurther ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.\nIn 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.\nIn his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.\nAround the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. \nFormer Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \n\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.\nBut nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.\nIn March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)\nYet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \n\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \n\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\n\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.\nAt the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. \nWith new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  \nAnd as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.\nDespite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.\nYet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\n\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\n\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\"",

The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US.",

One police officer was also reported to have died in the fighting. \nAccording to Shah, it is the first time in three decades that a Maoist of Rao's seniority had been killed by government forces. \nParts of Chhattisgarh have seen a long-running insurgency by the rebels, who say they have been neglected by governments for decades. The Indian government has vowed to end their insurgency by the end of March 2026. \nRao, an engineer by training, was the general secretary of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) group. He was on the most wanted list of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) -  India's counter-terrorism law enforcement body. \nVivekanand Sinha, a senior police official in Chhattisgarh, said the gunfight in which Rao and the others died, broke out in the Narayanpur district following an intelligence tip-off that senior Maoist leaders were in the area. \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X that he was \"proud of our forces for this remarkable success\".\nThe Communist Party of India, meanwhile, has condemned the killings and called for an independent inquiry. \nLast month, the Indian government launched a massive military operation - known as Black Forest - targeting the group. \nShah said on Wednesday that 54 rebels had been arrested so far, and 84 had surrendered in the states of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Maharashtra, as a result. \nThe operation was launched after the Maoists said they were ready for talks with the government if it halted its offensive and withdrew its troops. Chhattisgarh officials said any dialogue must be unconditional. \nThe Maoists are inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

All the parents started running towards the bus, no-one could understand what was going on,\" Nasir Mehmood, a sergeant in Pakistan's army tells us.\nNasir and I are in the city of Quetta, sitting in the waiting room of the largest military hospital in the province of Balochistan.  His 14-year-old son Mohammad Ahmad told him he was flung across the army school bus in a bombing in Khuzdar, a few hours' drive away.\nThe bus was carrying around 40 schoolchildren when it exploded at about 07:40 local time (02:40 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\"I reached the hospital, and there were screams of children everywhere, it was the only thing you could hear,\" Nasir said. \"My eyes just kept searching for my son.\"\nOnly the most serious cases were airlifted to the Combined Military Hospital. The military have said the death toll has now risen to eight, with six children killed and dozens injured. No group has admitted carrying out the attack.\nIt is rare for foreign journalists to be allowed to enter the province, south-west of Pakistan, let alone a hospital on the army's compound. The military said they wanted international media to witness the impact of the attack themselves.\nPakistan alleges India is linked to the attack, though there is no independent evidence - and it is a claim Delhi firmly denies.\nIndia and Pakistan are in the midst of a fragile ceasefire, after a two-week conflict that was their most significant one in decades. It saw them exchange drone attacks, missiles and artillery fire, and left dozens of casualties. \nThis attack in Balochistan is now in the middle of the tensions, with news channels broadcasting pictures of the children who were killed, most of them girls between the ages of 12 and 16, alongside accusations of an \"Indian terror campaign\". Images of scrapped metal, children's shoes and abandoned backpacks strewn along the scene highlight the tragedy.\n\nAs we walked through the intensive care unit, some children lay unconscious on their beds, others thrashed in pain. One young girl kept calling out for her mother as nurses tried to calm her. Doctors told us several children were in critical condition, having suffered extensive trauma, burns and fractured bones. The night before we arrived, another child had died. \nPakistan's Minister of Information, Attaullah Tarar, says there is a history of Indian proxies operating in Balochistan. In turn, India says that Pakistan has been harbouring militants who wage attacks on Indian-administered Kashmir for years. \nThe killing of 26 people in April, most of them tourists in Pahalgam, sparked the most recent conflict. Pakistan has called for an open investigation led by an independent party.\nHowever, Tarar denied that such an investigation was necessary in Balochistan.\n\"Pahalgam was a one-off incident,\" he told us. \"We are the victims in this case. We have been suffering. There is a history. We have evidence. So what can I say?\"\nWhen we asked him what that evidence was, he once again pointed to claims of a history of attacks.  He gave us no other details of India's alleged involvement in this attack.\nLater, an officer drove us through Quetta's roads in a bus flanked by soldiers carrying rifles and ammunition hanging from their pockets.\nBalochistan has experienced decades of militant attacks linked to a nationalist insurgency. It is home to several groups which accuse the government of exploiting its natural resources.\nIn March, some 21 people, most of them off-duty security personnel, were killed during a train siege in Balochistan's remote Sibi district.\nThat attack was carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). \nPakistan, as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation.\nAs the military responds to the insurgency, activists in Balochistan accuse Pakistan's security forces of human rights violations. They say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared in the last two decades, and are allegedly detained without due legal process.\nThe minister of information told us the government believed \"faceless courts\" might be needed in the province, hiding the identities of the judges and prosecutors in terror cases. Tarar said the courts often fail to convict the accused, because of a fear of retribution from militant groups.\nIn a press conference, the military spokesperson, Lt Gen Chaudhry, said the school bus attack  \"had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India's provocation\".\nThe government says it is raising the issue \"across diplomatic channels\" around the world. \nThe impact on the ceasefire and on the prospect of talks between India and Pakistan remains to be seen.\nAdditional reporting by Malik Mudassir",

        "article_text": "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.\nLast week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.\nAs a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI). \n\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"\nThe change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.\nThat may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".\n\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".\nThere were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.\nNomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.\nSome analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.\nFor one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.\nIndia and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.\nIndia has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.\nBut all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.\nApart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month. \n\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"\nA tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.\nThe Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.\nThe government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind. \nAnother major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.\n\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAccording to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.\n\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.\nThe jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.\nQuite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme. \nFinally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.\nIndia doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.\nBut experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.\nAll of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.\n\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post. \n\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\" \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nSharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.\nPakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nPakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.\nLate on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.\nBut Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nOn 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments.",

For whatever reason, in the northern hemisphere at least, the concept of a bolter has become synonymous with Lions squad selection.\nIt refers to the inexperienced, overlooked and out of favour. Players propelled from leftfield to centre stage and on to the plane with the best of Britain and Ireland.\nBack row Sam Simmonds, who had not been chosen for England in three years, was that pick when the Lions toured South Africa in 2021.\nSome bolters have blossomed into Lions greats.\nJeremy Guscott and Martin Johnson had each made just one appearance for England before playing for the Lions. Jason Robinson was still learning the game after switching from rugby league.\nOther gambles have not paid such dividends.\nHere are nine potential picks, all less than probable but the right side of impossible, to listen out for when Wales great Ieuan Evans announces the squad on Thursday.\nFarrell has not played Test rugby since 2023, after taking a break from internationals before moving to Racing 92\n\"I'd pick Owen Farrell. Who do you want in there when the going gets tough? Test-match animals.\"\nBack in October when he was asked by the Times who should start at fly-half, external for the first Test against the Wallabies, Johnny Sexton was retired from playing, working for a glass company and publicising his autobiography.\nNow, intriguingly, Sexton has been signed up as a coach for the tour.\nThe fallout would be substantial, but head coach Andy Farrell might judge selecting his son worth it.\nWith little Lions Test experience among other potential 10s, three-time tourist Farrell brings an accountability and intensity few can match.\nEven as a 21-year-old tour rookie in Australia in 2013, his communication and leadership were picked out as an example to the rest of the squad by captain Alun Wyn Jones.\nFarrell has endured a difficult, injury-interrupted season with French club Racing 92, though he and his team have come into some welcome form recently, winning five out of seven matches since the former Saracen's comeback from a groin problem in March.\nHowever, his final chance to press his case ended early when a head knock forced an early exit from Sunday's European Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Lyon \nMurray was born and brought up in New Zealand but qualifies for Wales via his mother\nAfter a wretched run of 17 successive Test defeats and with no Welsh voice among Andy Farrell's support staff, representation from The Dragons could be at an all-time low.\nWales have never supplied fewer than five players for a Lions squad. If they are to get up towards that figure again, then Blair Murray could be on the plane.\nThe Lions do not have huge depth at full-back.\nIreland's Hugo Keenan will likely tour, but Scotland's first-choice 15 Blair Kinghorn suffered a knee knock recently and would be a late arrival on tour with Toulouse destined for Top 14 play-offs.\nEngland have shuffled between George Furbank, Freddie Steward and Marcus Smith over the past year.\nMurray, all scampering pace and jagging sidesteps, would be a crowd-pleasing pick. The sort of player who might revel on midweek hard grounds against Australia's Super Rugby sides.\nOsborne has scored 12 points, via two tries and a conversion, in his seven caps\nDebuts do not come much more imposing than away and at altitude against the world champion Springboks. Add playing in a position you have not started a game in for nearly two years and you understand the extent of Jamie Osborne's Test baptism.\nHowever, the 23-year-old scored a try, kept his place and was part of a team that shared the series spoils in South Africa.\nOsborne is a slight but rangy runner, with deft hands, aerial ability, a kicking game and an understanding with the Leinster and Ireland team-mates who will make up a large touring contingent. \nThe clincher though could be his versatility.\nCovering full-back, wing and centre is useful on a hectic tour and would potentially give Farrell more licence to load the bench with forwards.\nJordan made his professional debut in September 2022\nAnother with the ability to fill a few backline vacancies.\nJordan was playing semi-professional rugby with Ayrshire Bulls until 2021 and only made his Scotland debut in November.\nHe has seized the chance opened up by an injury to Sione Tuipulotu though, and was integral to Scotland's sharp backline in the Six Nations, with clever support lines, a step and a good offloading game.\nWith England's Ollie Lawrence out through injury - one of the favourites for a midfield role in Australia - Jordan could benefit from another's misfortune once again.\nBound for Bristol next season, the New Zealand-born Glasgow star can also back up fly-half and full-back.\nFord was England's starting fly-half in every game in the 2024 Six Nations, but has not done so since\nCan a bolter come with 99 Test caps already to their name?\nGeorge Ford has slipped down the England fly-half pecking order, with first Marcus Smith and then Fin Smith steering the ship.\nBut Ford has been in dazzling club form for Sale, playing close to the line and easing open holes for himself or runners. His one cameo in the Six Nations - a 25-minute replacement appearance against Wales - featured more sublime touches.\nHe has never toured with the Lions and, at 32, is unlikely to if he misses out this time.\nFord's composure and experience could be an ideal counterfoil to the more extravagant 10s under consideration.\nCummings made his Scotland debut in a Rugby World Cup warm-up match against France in 2019\nCummings' injury absence attracted fewer headlines than the loss of captain Tuipulotu, but arguably was just as damaging to Scotland's Six Nations campaign given his front-five heft and nous.\nThe 28-year-old second row is only just back from his broken arm, making an appearance off the bench in Glasgow's loss to the Bulls in the United Rugby Championship (URC).\nHowever, his excellent work alongside Grant Gilchrist in Scotland's engine room prior to his lay-off will stand him in good stead in a position likely to be dominated by English and Irish options.\nSmith left the Ospreys last summer to join Leicester\nThe mid-Six Nations bounce that stand-in coach Matt Sherratt coaxed out of Wales included drafting in an all-new front row.\nNicky Smith was one of those promoted and his scrummaging provided a platform for a vastly improved showing against Ireland.\nSigned by Leicester last summer, he has also been key to Tigers' push towards the Premiership play-offs under Michael Cheika.\nWith Ellis Genge and Andrew Porter expected to fill two of three loose-head spots, he would likely have to edge out Scotland's Pierre Schoeman to get a squad slot.\nMight Wales' final-round trouncing at the hands of England count against him in the final reckoning?\nPollock's speed around the pitch had drawn comparisons to former Wales and Lions flanker Justin Tipuric\nCould the Northampton flanker's soaraway season finish on Lions duty?\nThere has been no sign of opposition taming the 20-year-old's dynamism and energy in his breakthrough campaign.\nAn Under-20 World Cup winner with England last summer, he has become a mainstay in Saints' back row, offering a turnover threat at the breakdown and massive metre-making in the loose.\nHe scored two tries as he made his England debut off the bench in the Six Nations and another in a hugely impressive victory over Leinster in the Champions Cup semi-final on Saturday.\nBack row is fiercely competitive as ever, with exiled Englishman Jack Willis, playing at French side Toulouse, also in contention.\nPollock attempting to defend the team's stuffed-toy mascot from his team-mates - a traditional duty for the tour's youngest player - would provide plenty of morale-boosting amusement for the party however.\nRibbans has spoken of his frustration at not getting more game time with England under Eddie Jones and Steve Borthwick\nAppointed Toulon co-captain after just a year in France, David Ribbans has acclimatised fast to life in the Top 14.\nThere is even a banner at Stade Mayol, with his face, a St George's cross and the slogan 'God Save Ribbans'.\nThe 29-year-old second row, who won 11 England caps before moving to France, has been in fantastic form, leading with physicality.\nThe Top 14 play-offs, with semi-finals on the same weekend the Lions play Argentina in Dublin, pose a logistical problem, but perhaps not an insurmountable one.\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

        "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.\nThe recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\n\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\n\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.\nIndia and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. \nThe LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. \nCeasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)\nThe LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". \nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. \nNot surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\n\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.\nViolence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.\nThe 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.\nBetween 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \n\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.\nTensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\n\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.\nMr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\n\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.\nMr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.\nHe argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \nThe hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.\nSome experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\n\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"\nIn his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \n\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.\nToday, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\n\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.\nIt was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",

        "article_text": "It's a grim paradox, doctors say.\nOn the one hand, antibiotics are being overused until they no longer work, driving resistance and fuelling the rise of deadly superbugs. On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.\nA new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.\nIndia bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  \nCommon in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. \nThey can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.\n\"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups,\" says Dr Abdul Ghafur, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. \"We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die.\"\nThe irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.\n\"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need,\" says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.\nThe study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. \nResearchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. \nFor example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. \nWhat prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? \nPhysicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.\n\"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all,\" says Dr Ghafur. \"We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do.\"\nTo improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. \n\"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist,\" says Dr Ghafur. \"Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice.\"\nTo fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.\nIndia bears one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.\n\"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics,\" says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from promising new antibiotics to advanced diagnostics.\nDr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. \nThis would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. \nInnovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a \"hub-and-spoke approach\" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programmes, researchers say.\nWithout access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. \n\"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access,\" says Dr Ghafur. \"When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients.\" \nClearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.",

In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments.

His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "Nearly two dozen paintings by one of the world's most celebrated modern artists - once part of a record-breaking art deal - are set to hit the auction block for the first time next week.\nOn 12 June, 25 rare MF Husain paintings will go under the hammer at an art gallery in Mumbai city, more than two decades after he painted them. \nThis will be the first public glimpse of the paintings, locked away in bank vaults since 2008 after authorities seized them from a prominent businessman over an alleged loan default.\n\"It's like the paintings have come full circle,\" says Dadiba Pundole, director of Pundole Art Gallery, where the auction is set to be held.\nHusain used the gallery as his studio for many of these works, part of an ambitious 100-painting series he never finished. Often called the \"Picasso of India,\" he was one of the country's most celebrated - and controversial - artists. His works have fetched millions, but his bold themes often drew criticism. He died in 2011, aged 95.\nTitled MF Husain: An Artist's Vision of the XX Century, the 25 paintings at Pundole'a gallery offer a glimpse into his take on a transformative century shaped by leaps in technology, politics, and culture. Pundole has estimated that the auction could fetch up to $29m (\u00a321m).\nThis comes months after another Husain painting, Untitled (Gram Yatra), sold for an unprecedented $13.8m at a Christie's auction in New York, becoming the most expensive Indian artwork to be auctioned.\nThe oil-on-canvas masterpiece had adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital for almost five decades, forgotten by the art world, until the auction house was alerted about its presence in 2013.\nThe latest paintings to be auctioned seem to follow a similar trajectory.\nHusain began working on them in the early 2000s, with great excitement and vigour, recalls Pundole.\n\"When he was painting, nothing could disturb him. It didn't matter what was happening around him,\" he adds.\nIn 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessman as the first instalment of a billion-rupee deal.\nKishore Singh, author of MF Husain: The Journey of a Legend, wrote about this agreement in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\"He [Husain] wasn't jealous of fellow artists, but he was competitive,\" Singh writes, noting that Husain struck the deal soon after Tyeb Mehta's Kali [an Indian goddess] set a new record for India's most expensive painting in 2002, selling for 15 million rupees.\nHusain struck a billion rupees deal with businessman Guru Swarup Srivastava for this series of paintings. Media dubbed it \"India's biggest art deal,\" catapulting the little-known Srivastava into overnight fame as a celebrity collector.\nBut two years later, India's top crime agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), began investigating Srivastava's business, alleging he and associates had misused a loan from a government-backed agricultural body.\nThe CBI alleged Srivastava diverted the funds into real estate, mutual funds, and  Husain paintings. He and his company deny all charges; the case remains in court.\nIn 2008, a tribunal allowed the government-backed agricultural body to seize one billion rupees in assets from Srivastava, including the 25 Husain paintings.\nIn February this year, a court cleared the way for the paintings to be auctioned to recover part of the loan. And so, after years locked away in bank vaults, the 25 paintings are finally stepping into the spotlight.\nIn a 2018 interview to author and journalist Tara Kaushal, Srivastava spoke about his stalled deal with the artist.\n\"I had planned to pay Husain for the rest of the paintings by selling the first 25. But legal complications meant that, when Husain called me in 2008 saying the paintings were ready in London and Paris, and to pick them up at the agreed price, my funds were not ready. He understood,\" he said.\nAsked why Husain had chosen to sell his paintings to a person who almost nobody knew in India's elite art circles, Pundole says, \"He didn't care. As long as his paintings were sold.\"\nThere's no way to know how Husain felt about the failed deal or his unfinished 20th Century series - but the episode remains a striking footnote in his bold, eventful career. \nThe 25 paintings in this series, vibrant acrylics on canvas, showcase Husain's bold style while reflecting key 20th-century events and social attitudes. \nOne painting shows an unlikely group chatting on a bench, symbolising Husain's call for peaceful dialogue and coexistence among global powers.\nAnother painting honours Charlie Chaplin while juxtaposing a rocket launch to highlight the contrast between social and economic disparities and massive state spending.\nOther paintings depict a world battling poverty, soldiers in trenches, and humanity confronting tragedies like World War Two, the Partition, and the Holocaust.

        "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.\nHe believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.\nSir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"\nThe ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.\nA blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.\nA host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.\nToby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.\nThe film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.\nSir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"\nSince then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.\nOcean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.\nThe new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. The trawlers are often after a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.\n\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.\nThe process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.  \nSir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".\nSir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.\nIt is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.\nJust one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"\nBut in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.\nOne of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"\nDespite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"\nSir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.\nHe believes that could be transformational. \n\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"\nA healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.\n\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.\nAs he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.\nOcean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\". \nThe strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.\nPakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. \nIslamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. \nThis sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.  \nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nExperts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.\nIndia says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. \nAmong the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. \nThe deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. \nPakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.\n\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.  \n\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.\nThe India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.\nAjay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".\n\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nIndian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".\n\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.\n\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\" \nThe majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.\n\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.\n\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"\nPakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".\nDr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.\n\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".\nChristopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.\n\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.  \n\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.\nDespite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.\n\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.\nHowever, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.\nExperts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.\n\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.\n\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"\nDr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.\n\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.\n\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.\n\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"\nIndia is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. \nShortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.\nThis mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. \nThe crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance....

Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Indian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond? \"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.Does this attack mark a new escalation?In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.",

        "article_text": "Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India Company gradually transformed into a colonial power. \nBy the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, Company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling.\nA Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by DAG, an art gallery in Delhi, features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of Company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists.\nPainted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs.\n\"The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes,\" says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show.\n\"Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them,  and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met \u2013 or at least observed \u2013 multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but \u2013 as they began to discern \u2013 were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice.\"\nBeyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. \nBefore photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists.\nBeyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb.\nThe once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. \nFrom June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)\nThe largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). \nWhile Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it.\nOriginally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801.\n\"The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century,\" writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. \n\"These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected.\"\nAnother painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. \nAt the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. \nLabeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.\nBy the late 18th Century, Company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. \nArt historian Mildred Archer called them a \"fascinating record of Indian social life,\" blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. \nRegional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers.\n\"They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life,\" says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.\nMost studies of Company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. \nA striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800.\nOne painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue.\nAmong the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting  boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats.\nWith no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.\nCompany paintings often featured natural history studies, portraying birds, animals, and plants - especially from private menageries. \nAs seen in the DAG show, these subjects are typically shown life-size against plain white backgrounds, with minimal surroundings - just the occasional patch of grass. The focus remains firmly on the species itself.\nAshish Anand, CEO of DAG, says the the latest show proposes Company paintings as the \"starting point of Indian modernism\".\nAnand says this \"was the moment when Indian artists who had trained in courtly ateliers first moved outside the court (and the temple) to work for new patrons\". \n\"The agendas of those patrons were not tied up with courtly or religious concerns; they were founded on scientific enquiry and observation,\" he says. \n\"Never mind that the patrons were foreigners. What should strike us now is how Indian artists responded to their demands, creating entirely new templates of Indian art.\"",

Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.\nHours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\nThe strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.\nPeople living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.\nMaria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.\nIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,\" Maria says.\nShe adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border.

        "article_text": "During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. \nBehind this authoritarian curtain, her Congress party government quietly began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book.\nIn Indira Gandhi and the Years That Transformed India, Prof Raghavan shows how Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system - one that would centralise executive power, sideline an \"obstructionist\" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus.\nInspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. \nIt all began, writes Prof Raghavan, in September 1975, when BK Nehru, a seasoned diplomat and a close aide of Gandhi, wrote a letter hailing the Emergency as a \"tour de force of immense courage and power produced by popular support\" and urged Gandhi to seize the moment. \nParliamentary democracy had \"not been able to provide the answer to our needs\", Nehru wrote. In this system the executive was continuously dependent on the support of an elected legislature \"which is looking for popularity and stops any unpleasant measure\".\nWhat India needed, Nehru said, was a directly elected president - freed from parliamentary dependence and capable of taking \"tough, unpleasant and unpopular decisions\" in the national interest, Prof Raghavan writes.\nThe model he pointed to was de Gaulle's France - concentrating power in a strong presidency. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. He even proposed stripping fundamental rights - right to equality or freedom of speech, for example - of their justiciability.\nNehru urged Indira Gandhi to \"make these fundamental changes in the Constitution now when you have two-thirds majority\". His ideas were \"received with rapture\" by the prime minister's secretary PN Dhar. Gandhi then gave Nehru approval to discuss these ideas with her party leaders but said \"very clearly and emphatically\" that he  should not convey the impression that they had the stamp of her approval. \nProf Raghavan writes that the ideas met with enthusiastic support from senior Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram and foreign minister Swaran Singh. The chief minister of Haryana state  was blunt: \"Get rid of this election nonsense. If you ask me just make our sister [Indira Gandhi] President for life and there's no need to do anything else\". M Karunanidhi of Tamil Nadu \u2013 one of two non-Congress chief ministers consulted - was unimpressed.\nWhen Nehru reported back to Gandhi, she remained non-committal, Prof Raghavan writes. She instructed her closest aides to explore the proposals further. \nWhat emerged was a document titled \"A Fresh Look at Our Constitution: Some suggestions\", drafted in secrecy and circulated among trusted advisors. It proposed a president with powers greater than even their American counterpart, including control over judicial appointments and legislation. A new \"Superior Council of Judiciary\", chaired by the president, would interpret \"laws and the Constitution\" - effectively neutering the Supreme Court.\nGandhi sent this document to Dhar, who recognised it \"twisted the Constitution in an ambiguously authoritarian direction\". Congress president DK Barooah tested the waters by publicly calling for a \"thorough re-examination\" of the Constitution at the party's 1975 annual session.\nThe idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal. But its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.\nThe amendment made striking down laws harder by requiring supermajorities of five or seven judges, and aimed to dilute the Constitution's 'basic structure doctrine' that limited parliament's power.\nIt also handed the federal government sweeping authority to deploy armed forces in states, declare region-specific Emergencies, and extend President's Rule - direct federal rule - from six months to a year. It also put election disputes out of the judiciary's reach.\nThis was not yet a presidential system, but it carried its genetic imprint - a powerful executive, marginalised judiciary and weakened checks and balances.  The Statesman newspaper warned that \"by one sure stroke, the amendment tilts the constitutional balance in favour of the parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, Gandhi's loyalists were going all in. Defence minister Bansi Lal urged \"lifelong power\" for her as prime minister, while Congress members in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh unanimously called for a new constituent assembly in October 1976.\n\"The prime minister was taken aback. She decided to snub these moves and hasten the passage of the amendment bill in the parliament,\" writes Prof Raghavan.\nBy December 1976, the bill had been passed by both houses of parliament and ratified by 13 state legislatures and signed into law by the president.\nAfter Gandhi's shock defeat in 1977, the short-lived Janata Party - a patchwork of anti-Gandhi forces - moved quickly to undo the damage. Through the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Amendments, it rolled back key parts of the Forty Second, scrapping authoritarian provisions and restoring democratic checks and balances.\nGandhi was swept back to power in January 1980, after the Janata Party government collapsed due to internal divisions and leadership struggles. Curiously, two years later, prominent voices in the party again mooted the idea of a presidential system.\nIn 1982, with President Sanjiva Reddy's term ending, Gandhi seriously considered stepping down as prime minister to become president of India. \nHer principal secretary later revealed she was \"very serious\" about the move. She was tired of carrying the Congress party on her back and saw the presidency as a way to deliver a \"shock treatment to her party, thereby giving it a new stimulus\".\nUltimately, she backed down. Instead, she elevated Zail Singh, her loyal home minister, to the presidency.\nDespite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system. Did Gandhi, a deeply tactical politician, hold herself back ? Or was there no national appetite for radical change and India's parliamentary system proved sticky?\nThere was a hint of presidential drift in the early 1970s, as India's parliamentary democracy - especially after 1967 - grew more competitive and unstable, marked by fragile coalitions, according to Prof Raghavan. Around this time, voices began suggesting that a presidential system might suit India better. The Emergency became the moment when these ideas crystallised into serious political thinking.\n\"The aim was to reshape the system in ways that immediately strengthened her hold on power. There was no grand long-term design - most of the lasting consequences of her [Gandhi's] rule were likely unintended,\" Prof Raghavan told the BBC.\n\"During the Emergency, her primary goal was short-term: to shield her office from any challenge. The Forty Second Amendment was crafted to ensure that even the judiciary couldn't stand in her way.\"\nThe itch for a presidential system within the Congress never quite faded. As late as April 1984, senior minister Vasant Sathe launched a nationwide debate advocating a shift to presidential governance - even while in power. \nBut six months later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in Delhi, and with her, the conversation abruptly died. India stayed a parliamentary democracy.  ",

        "article_text": "\"My neighbours thought I'd lost my mind,\" says farmer Kakasaheb Sawant.\nIn 2022 he had decided to plant some apple trees, not crazy for a farmer unless, like Mr Sawant, you live in subtropical southern India, where temperatures can hit 43C.\nHe bought 100 saplings, of which 80 survived. Last year each tree produced between 30 and 40 kilogrammes of fruit.\n\"My farm has become something of a local miracle. People travel from far-off places just to see the apple trees growing under the hot Maharashtra sun.\"\nIt's not been an unqualified success though. One problem is that the apples are not sweet enough to sell.\nMr Sawant remains enthusiastic. He's had some success selling apple tree saplings and is optimistic about future harvests.\n\"This is the beginning. The trees are getting acclimatised so according to me in next four to five years these trees will start bearing good, sweet apples.\"\nIn his own small way, Mr Sawant is hoping to meet India's rising demand for apples. \nProduction has risen 15% over the last five years to 2.5 million tonnes.\nBut that is not keeping up with demand and India's imports have roughly doubled to 600,000 tonnes over the same period, according to S Chandrashekhar, who analyses India's apple trade. \n\"We do have a shortage of apple production,\" he says. \"There are not many new players... at the same time, and there is no new investment.\"\nEssential for a good apple crop is a lengthy period of winter temperature between 0C and 6C.\nCountries like the UK, with around 1,000 hours of this chill-time, can produce almost any apple variety.\nBut in India areas with those conditions are more limited. \nMost of India's apples come from two regions in the north of the country -Jammu and Kashmir and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh.\nMr Chandrashekhar says that many farms in those regions are becoming less productive. \n\"There are lot of old orchards producing fewer apples - that means the yield is coming down,\" he says.\nHe says that climate change is making conditions less favourable.\n\nIn the hope of expanding apple production into new areas, some scientists and farmers are experimenting with so-called low-chill varieties.\nThose are apple trees that can produce crops with around 400 hours of temperatures between 0C and 6C.\nRanchi, eastern India is also not an apple growing region - its subtropical climate is too hot. \nBut researchers at the Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) are testing 18 saplings of three low-chill varieties.\nSuccess has been limited so far -  only one of the varieties has produced any fruit. \n\"The plants have not reached optimal sizes. The tree has given us only around one to two kilogrammes of apples in 2024.  I would not say that they are of best quality, but they were edible,\" says Dr Majid Ali. \nHe says that as well as an unfavourable climate, the local soil is not ideal for apple trees and the trees get attacked by termites.\n\"This is an experimental stage. To reach a conclusion it would take three to four years to say if it is successful.\"\nHe says that some local farmers have also been experimenting with low-chill apple varieties, also with little success. \nSome are sceptical that apples cultivated in hot areas will ever be a commercial proposition. \n\"The fruit that grows in non-traditional regions has a very short shelf life. The taste is not so sweet,\" says Dr Dinesh Thakur, associate director of a regional horticulture research and training centre at Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry.\n\"These low-chill apples can be grown as novelty fruit in a kitchen garden, but their viability as a commercial crop is not proven... most of them are a failure,\" he says. \nDr Thakur is based in the traditional northern apple growing region of Himachal Pradesh and his research focuses on the improvement of apples through breeding.\n\"Climatic change is creating havoc in apple cultivation,\" he says. \nHe says the number of those crucial chilling hours are falling and due to erratic weather conditions farmers are facing colossal financial losses every year. \nIn search of better conditions, some orchards are being planted in higher locations, which were once considered too cold, he says.\nUnder a government sponsored project his team are experimenting with 300 varieties of apples, to assess the impact of climate change.\n\"We are also working on climate-resilient apple genotypes that can withstand the existing climate,\" he says.\nSo far, they have developed an apple that matures with a ripe colour two months earlier than existing apple trees. \n\"This helps offset erratic weather patterns brought by climate change and has a quality advantage over those areas where  colour formation is problem due to lack of sunlight,\" Dr Thakur says. \n\"This is just the beginning of research to create climate resilient fruit and create a fruit that is acceptable to the Indian taste bud.\"\nFor Mr Chandrashekhar, boosting India's apple output will take more than just scientific work. \n\"Apple orchards in the traditional apple cultivation areas are 15 to 20 years old. What is needed is replanting of new saplings,\" he says.\n\"The industry needs investment, huge investment. Who will do that?\" he asks.\nHe would like to see the juice and jam business developed, to provide the industry with another source of income. \n\"That has to be a booster which can improve the apple economy and provide a better position for apple growers.\"",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

        "article_text": "During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. \nBehind this authoritarian curtain, her Congress party government quietly began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book.\nIn Indira Gandhi and the Years That Transformed India, Prof Raghavan shows how Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system - one that would centralise executive power, sideline an \"obstructionist\" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus.\nInspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. \nIt all began, writes Prof Raghavan, in September 1975, when BK Nehru, a seasoned diplomat and a close aide of Gandhi, wrote a letter hailing the Emergency as a \"tour de force of immense courage and power produced by popular support\" and urged Gandhi to seize the moment. \nParliamentary democracy had \"not been able to provide the answer to our needs\", Nehru wrote. In this system the executive was continuously dependent on the support of an elected legislature \"which is looking for popularity and stops any unpleasant measure\".\nWhat India needed, Nehru said, was a directly elected president - freed from parliamentary dependence and capable of taking \"tough, unpleasant and unpopular decisions\" in the national interest, Prof Raghavan writes.\nThe model he pointed to was de Gaulle's France - concentrating power in a strong presidency. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. He even proposed stripping fundamental rights - right to equality or freedom of speech, for example - of their justiciability.\nNehru urged Indira Gandhi to \"make these fundamental changes in the Constitution now when you have two-thirds majority\". His ideas were \"received with rapture\" by the prime minister's secretary PN Dhar. Gandhi then gave Nehru approval to discuss these ideas with her party leaders but said \"very clearly and emphatically\" that he  should not convey the impression that they had the stamp of her approval. \nProf Raghavan writes that the ideas met with enthusiastic support from senior Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram and foreign minister Swaran Singh. The chief minister of Haryana state  was blunt: \"Get rid of this election nonsense. If you ask me just make our sister [Indira Gandhi] President for life and there's no need to do anything else\". M Karunanidhi of Tamil Nadu \u2013 one of two non-Congress chief ministers consulted - was unimpressed.\nWhen Nehru reported back to Gandhi, she remained non-committal, Prof Raghavan writes. She instructed her closest aides to explore the proposals further. \nWhat emerged was a document titled \"A Fresh Look at Our Constitution: Some suggestions\", drafted in secrecy and circulated among trusted advisors. It proposed a president with powers greater than even their American counterpart, including control over judicial appointments and legislation. A new \"Superior Council of Judiciary\", chaired by the president, would interpret \"laws and the Constitution\" - effectively neutering the Supreme Court.\nGandhi sent this document to Dhar, who recognised it \"twisted the Constitution in an ambiguously authoritarian direction\". Congress president DK Barooah tested the waters by publicly calling for a \"thorough re-examination\" of the Constitution at the party's 1975 annual session.\nThe idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal. But its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.\nThe amendment made striking down laws harder by requiring supermajorities of five or seven judges, and aimed to dilute the Constitution's 'basic structure doctrine' that limited parliament's power.\nIt also handed the federal government sweeping authority to deploy armed forces in states, declare region-specific Emergencies, and extend President's Rule - direct federal rule - from six months to a year. It also put election disputes out of the judiciary's reach.\nThis was not yet a presidential system, but it carried its genetic imprint - a powerful executive, marginalised judiciary and weakened checks and balances.  The Statesman newspaper warned that \"by one sure stroke, the amendment tilts the constitutional balance in favour of the parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, Gandhi's loyalists were going all in. Defence minister Bansi Lal urged \"lifelong power\" for her as prime minister, while Congress members in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh unanimously called for a new constituent assembly in October 1976.\n\"The prime minister was taken aback. She decided to snub these moves and hasten the passage of the amendment bill in the parliament,\" writes Prof Raghavan.\nBy December 1976, the bill had been passed by both houses of parliament and ratified by 13 state legislatures and signed into law by the president.\nAfter Gandhi's shock defeat in 1977, the short-lived Janata Party - a patchwork of anti-Gandhi forces - moved quickly to undo the damage. Through the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Amendments, it rolled back key parts of the Forty Second, scrapping authoritarian provisions and restoring democratic checks and balances.\nGandhi was swept back to power in January 1980, after the Janata Party government collapsed due to internal divisions and leadership struggles. Curiously, two years later, prominent voices in the party again mooted the idea of a presidential system.\nIn 1982, with President Sanjiva Reddy's term ending, Gandhi seriously considered stepping down as prime minister to become president of India. \nHer principal secretary later revealed she was \"very serious\" about the move. She was tired of carrying the Congress party on her back and saw the presidency as a way to deliver a \"shock treatment to her party, thereby giving it a new stimulus\".\nUltimately, she backed down. Instead, she elevated Zail Singh, her loyal home minister, to the presidency.\nDespite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system. Did Gandhi, a deeply tactical politician, hold herself back ? Or was there no national appetite for radical change and India's parliamentary system proved sticky?\nThere was a hint of presidential drift in the early 1970s, as India's parliamentary democracy - especially after 1967 - grew more competitive and unstable, marked by fragile coalitions, according to Prof Raghavan. Around this time, voices began suggesting that a presidential system might suit India better. The Emergency became the moment when these ideas crystallised into serious political thinking.\n\"The aim was to reshape the system in ways that immediately strengthened her hold on power. There was no grand long-term design - most of the lasting consequences of her [Gandhi's] rule were likely unintended,\" Prof Raghavan told the BBC.\n\"During the Emergency, her primary goal was short-term: to shield her office from any challenge. The Forty Second Amendment was crafted to ensure that even the judiciary couldn't stand in her way.\"\nThe itch for a presidential system within the Congress never quite faded. As late as April 1984, senior minister Vasant Sathe launched a nationwide debate advocating a shift to presidential governance - even while in power. \nBut six months later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in Delhi, and with her, the conversation abruptly died. India stayed a parliamentary democracy.  ",

        "article_text": "\"Who is responsible for this mess?\"\nThe question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated.\nHeavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours. \nEven a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral. \nThe pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\nFollowing criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late.\nThe crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai.\nFrom Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt.\nExperts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem. \n\"The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,\" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi.\n\"Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,\" he adds.\nExperts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses.\nIndia receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September.\nThe monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent.\nBut experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people.\nThis year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared. \n\"A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,\" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. \nIn Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding.\nThis year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department. \nMany residents reported damage to their property. \nAt least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports.\nMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same. \nOnce known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding.\n\"Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,\" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist.\nThese valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says. \n\"When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.\" \nMr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made.\nViolations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides.\nBut experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain.\n\"The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,\" Mr Kukerja says. \"Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience.\"\nThis isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more. \nOver the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way. \nSo, can anything be done to prevent this?\n\"Yes,\" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy.\nHe suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses.\n\"But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,\" he said.\nFor India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

So it's hugely significant.\"\nIn Wales, it is an offence to release beavers into open rivers without a licence, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said no licences of this type had been issued.\nIn England, where the government recently approved beavers' reintroduction to the wild, it is thought that there are about 500 of them - some in the wild and others in enclosures.\nIn Scotland, which began reintroducing beavers to the wild several years ago, it is thought that there are now more than 1,500.\n\"We had information that a beaver had been seen on this section of the River Dyfi, and we were told to get to this particular site at 18:00 and the beaver will be there,\" said Williams.\n\"We had gone out a few days before, and it poured with rain and we'd seen nothing.\n\"And I must admit, I was thinking, we're not going to get it. \n\"But then when we went on the first dry day, 18:00, and the beaver was there.\"\nWilliams said the beaver \"didn't pay us any attention at all\".\n\"It was very chill,\" he added.\n\"We were on the opposite bank, and we thought we better be quiet, don't move around. And the beaver just saw us and it just carried on feeding and swam.\"\nLocal people have reported seeing the beaver, and others, on the same stretch of the River Dyfi multiple times in recent years.\nBut exactly where they have come from remains a mystery, after a nearby beaver enclosure ruled out any escapes.\nAlicia Leow-Dyke, from Wildlife Trust Wales, said there was evidence of the semi-aquatic animals breeding along the waterway.\n\"On this occasion we know it's one family. It could be two families - one family split into two,\" she said.\n\"There has been evidence of breeding on the river. Youngsters have been spotted on the river over the years.\n\"Beavers only breed once a year and their litters are pretty small - two to three within a litter. So a beaver family could be anything from two adults, to five or eight if you include the young.\"\nLast year the Welsh government said it was considering introducing legislation to protect beavers, as wildlife charities called for them to be released into Wales' rivers.\nDr Robert Needham, from the Beaver Trust, said their reintroduction could bring substantial benefits, describing them as \"ecosystem engineer[s]\".\n\"What this means is that the sort of habitat modification that beavers can do through damming, building lodges, digging canals - this can create habitats for other species, and they can increase biodiversity,\" said Dr Needham.\n\"They can help restore our wetland habitats, which are massively lost throughout Europe, let alone Great Britain.\n\"They can help alleviate flooding with the dams that they create, particularly in headwater streams, they hold that water back, releasing it slowly. So we see a reduction in peak flow events, during storm events. But this can also be really beneficial to villages and society during summer periods, during drought conditions.\"\nBut not everyone believes that reintroducing beavers to the wild is a good thing. \nCritics say their dams can flood and waterlog fields while the animals themselves can feed on certain agricultural crops and damage trees.\n\"Fundamentally, there are issues. There are cases where river banks will fall in and the impact of flooding, particularly on good farmland as well,\" said Aled Jones, president of NFU Cymru.\n\"The management [of beavers] is crucial. We can't allow an indiscriminate approach where farming businesses are severely impacted. \n\"So we have to have control measures because this is their livelihoods. And we have to remember this is where farmers make their living, and anything negatively impacting that, if they're losing their crops because of flooding, who pays?\"\nIolo's River Valleys will be broadcast on BBC Two and BBC One Wales on 6 May at 19:00 and will also be available on BBC iPlayer.\nSign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

        "article_text": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.\nDespite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.\nIt also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. \nIn a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.\nDelhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".\nThe IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.\nEven Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\n\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.\nIndia's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".\nAs one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.\nUnlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.\nFor example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.\n\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.\nAddressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.\nIn their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.\nFurthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.\n\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. \nThe FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\n\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"\nAs things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.\nSeparately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.\nSuch reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.\nMr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.\nHe points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Atul Kumar (name changed) anxiously paced the corridor of a public hospital in India's capital Delhi.\nA small-appliance mechanic, he was struggling to secure medicines for his 26-year-old daughter who suffers from drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Mr Kumar said his daughter needed 22 tablets of Monopas, an antibiotic used for treating TB, every day. \n\"In the past 18 months, I haven't received government-supplied medicine for even two full months,\" he told BBC Hindi in January, months before India's declared deadline to eliminate the infectious disease.\nForced to buy costly drugs from private pharmacies, Mr Kumar was drowning in debt. A week's supply cost 1,400 rupees ($16; \u00a312), more than half his weekly income. \nAfter the BBC raised the issue, authorities supplied the medicines Mr Kumar's daughter needed. Federal Health Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said that the government usually acts quickly to fix medicine access issues when alerted.\nMr Kumar's daughter is one of millions of Indians suffering from tuberculosis, a bacterial disease that infects the lungs and is spread when the infected person coughs or sneezes.\nIndia, home to 27% of the world's tuberculosis cases, sees two TB-related deaths every three minutes. India's TB burden has long been tied to poor case detection, underfunding and erratic drug supply.\nDespite this grim reality, the country has set an ambitious goal. It aims to eliminate TB by the end of 2025, five years ahead of the global target set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations member states.\nElimination, as defined by the WHO, means cutting new TB cases by 80% and deaths by 90% compared with 2015 levels.\nBut visits to TB centres in Delhi and the eastern state of Odisha revealed troubling gaps in the government's TB programme.\nIn Odisha's Khordha district, around 30km (18.6 miles) from state capital Bhubaneshwar, 32-year-old day-labourer Kanhucharan Sahu is struggling to continue his two-year-old daughter's TB treatment, with government medicines unavailable for three months and private ones costing 1,500 rupees a month - an unbearable burden.\n\"We can't see her suffer anymore,\" he says, his voice breaking. \"We even thought of abandoning her.\"\nAt Odisha's local TB office, officials promised to review Sahu's case, but a staffer admitted, \"We rarely get the medicines we need, so we ration them.\"\nMr Sahu says he hasn't received the promised 1,000 rupees monthly support from the federal government and at the local TB office, officials admit to chronic shortages, leaving families like his adrift in a failing system.\nVijayalakshmi Routray, who runs the patient support group Sahyog, says medicine shortages are now routine, with government outlets often running dry. \"How can we talk about ending TB with such gaps?\" she asks.\nThere are other hurdles too - for example, changing treatment centres involves navigating complex bureaucracy, a barrier that often leads to missed doses and incomplete care. This poses a major hurdle for India's vast population of migrant workers.\nAt a hospital near Khordha, 50-year-old Babu Nayak, a sweeper who was diagnosed with TB in 2023, struggles to continue his treatment. He was regularly forced to travel 100km to his village for medicines as officials insisted he collect them from the original centre where he was diagnosed and first treated. \n\"It became too difficult,\" he says.\nUnable to travel so often, Mr Nayak stopped taking the medication altogether.\n\"It was a mistake,\" he admitted, after contracting TB again last year and being hospitalised.\nAt his hospital, no TB specialist was available, highlighting another critical gap in India's fight: a shortage of frontline health workers.\nThe BBC shared its findings with the federal health ministry and officials in charge of the TB programme in Delhi and Odisha. There was no response despite repeated reminders.\nA 2023 parliamentary report showed there were many vacant roles across all levels of the TB programme, affecting diagnosis, treatment and follow-up - especially in rural and underserved areas.\nIn 2018, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought forward India's TB elimination target to 2025, he cited the government's intensified efforts as a reason for optimism. \nTwo years later, the Covid pandemic disrupted TB elimination efforts globally, delaying diagnosis, diverting resources and pausing routine services. Medicine shortages, staff constraints and weakened patient monitoring have further widened the gap between ambition and reality.\nDespite these challenges, India has made some progress.\nOver the past decade, the country has reduced its tuberculosis-related mortality. Between 2015 and 2023, TB deaths declined from 28 to 22 per 100,000 people. This figure, however, is still high when compared with the global average which stands at 15.5.\nThe number of reported cases has gone up, which the government credits to its targeted outreach and screening programmes. In 2024, India recorded 2.6 million TB cases, up from 2.5 million in 2023.\nFederal Health Minister JP Nadda recently touted innovations like handheld X-ray devices as game-changers in expanding testing. But on the ground, the picture is less optimistic.\n\"I still see some patients come to me with reports of sputum (phlegm) smear microscopy for TB, a test which has a much lower detection rate as compared to genetic tests,\" says Dr Lancelot Pinto, a Mumbai-based epidemiologist.\nGenetic tests, which includes RT-PCR machines - widely used to diagnose HIV, influenza and most recently, Covid-19 - and Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing, also examine the sputum sample but with greater sensitivity and in a shorter timeframe.\nBesides, the tests can reveal whether the TB strain is drug-resistant or sensitive, something that microscopic testing can't do, Dr Pinto says.\nThe gap, he adds, stems not just from lack of awareness but from limited access to modern tests.\n\"Genetic testing is free at government hospitals but not uniformly available, with only a few states being able to provide it.\"\nIn May, Modi led a high-level review of India's TB elimination programme, reaffirming the country's commitment to defeating the disease.\nBut the official statement notably skipped mention of the 2025 deadline. Instead, it highlighted community-driven strategies - better sanitation, nutrition and social support for TB-affected families - as key to the fight.\nThe government has also prioritised better diagnosis, treatment and prevention at the core of its elimination strategy.\nThis approach mirrors the WHO's view of TB as a \"disease of poverty\". In its 2024 report, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called it \"the definitive disease of deprivation\", noting how poverty, malnutrition and treatment costs trap patients in a vicious cycle. As India pushes toward its goal of eliminating the disease, deep health and social inequalities remain hurdles.\nWith just six months left until India's self-imposed deadline, new complications have emerged.\nThe fallout from US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the WHO and suspension of USAID operations has raised concerns about future funding for global TB efforts. Since 1998, USAID has invested more than $140m to help diagnose and treat TB patients in India. \nHowever, India's federal health secretary insists there is \"no budgetary problem\" anticipated.\nMeanwhile, hope lies on the horizon. Sixteen TB vaccine candidates are currently in development across the world, with the WHO projecting potential availability within five years, pending successful trials.",

        "article_text": "Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. \nThe city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. \nThree people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday.\nBengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. \nMany parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. \nThis is \"rare\" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. \nApart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. \nIn one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee.\nVideos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. \nAuthorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to \"rectify\" the situation. \n\"There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,\" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. \nBut officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. \n\"No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,\" a user wrote on X.\nAnnu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. \n\"Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,\" she said. \nItty, who works in public policy, says a \"lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits\", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. \nKarnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.\nThe BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, \u00a387.5m) for relief operations.\nThe state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.\n\"The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,\" Shivakumar said.\nFloods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.\nAnanda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused \"discomfort and inconvenience\" for businesses. \n\"Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,\" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure. \n",

        "article_text": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.\nYet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.\nEven scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. \nSix years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. \nAs the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.\nPresident Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\n\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.\nIndia and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.\nThe bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \n\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.\nOne reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.\nSince testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. \nIndia, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.\nFurther ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.\nIn 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.\nIn his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.\nAround the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. \nFormer Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \n\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.\nBut nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.\nIn March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)\nYet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \n\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \n\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\n\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.\nAt the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. \nWith new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  \nAnd as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.\nDespite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.\nYet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\n\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\n\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\"",

        "article_text": "The Iranian Embassy in India has said it is investigating the case of three Indian nationals who went missing in Tehran earlier this month.\nThe men, all of whom are from the northern state of Punjab, had a stopover in Iran on 1 May, and were on their way to Australia, where they were promised lucrative jobs by a local travel agent. \nTheir families allege that they were kidnapped upon their arrival by unknown men, who are now demanding a ransom of 5m rupees ($63,000; \u00a347,000).\nOn Thursday, the Iranian Embassy said on X that it was keeping Indian authorities informed of all developments \"within the judicial system\" and warned about the dangers of taking illegal immigration routes.\n\"Given the nature of this incident, Indian citizens are strongly advised not to be deceived by the promises of unauthorised individuals or illegal Indian agencies offering travel to other countries,\" it said.\nThe statement came a day after the Indian embassy in Iran said that it had \"strongly taken up this matter with Iranian authorities\" and requested that the missing Indians be \"urgently traced and their safety ensured\".\nMany Indians, particularly from Punjab, travel to developed countries in search of job opportunities and a better life.\nSome fall victim to scams run by travel agents, who charge exorbitant fees and send them through illegal or unsafe routes, often without proper documentation.\nGurdeep Kaur recounted the events that led to her 23-year-old son Amritpal Singh going missing to BBC Punjabi. \nThe family had hired a travel agent in Hoshiarpur - where they live - to secure an Australian work permit for her son. \n\"Last month, the agent informed us that my son's visa had been approved and asked for 1.8m rupees as payment,\" she said.\n\"They told us they had booked a flight from Delhi to Australia on 26 April. But when my son went there, they told him that his documents were still not ready.\" \nThe agent then told Amritpal that they had rebooked him on a flight for 29 April, but later claimed that even that ticket got cancelled. \nOn 1 May, the agent put Amritpal, along with the two other men, on a flight to Iran, describing it as a stopover en route to Australia, Ms Kaur said. \nAfter landing, Amritpal called his mum to say that he had arrived safely and that a cab was on its way to take them to a hotel, before their next flight. \nBut an hour later, Ms Kaur said her son called again, this time to say that he had been kidnapped. \nBefore she could get any details, the call got cut abruptly and her son became unreachable. \nMs Kaur said that the family tried to contact the three agents in Punjab - they first gave them \"vague responses\" and then went missing.

        "article_text": "The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. \nThe viscose yarn \u2013 a popular material that goes into making woven garments \u2013 he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month.\nThat's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; \u00a30.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports.\nWith Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets.\nIndia's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs.\nWhile China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps.\nMill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition.\n\"We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,\" he says.\nJagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are \"slowing production\". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.\nChina's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.\n\"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.\nBut anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.\nWhile pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.\nTheir sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.\nIn 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.\nIndia, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (\u00a375bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.\nIn response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.\nIndia also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.\nDespite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. \nThat's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. \nWhile western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.\nIndia's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.\n\"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. \n\"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\"\nIndia needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.\nAkash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. \nWith fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.\nChina wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\".\nDespite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.\n\"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

I can't believe it. There was big pressure and big nerves. I knew if I missed he could come back quickly,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"I was so nervous tonight. Mark is still a top player and put me under so much pressure. He's the best.\"\nAlong with the \u00a3500,000 top prize, he will climb to 11th in the world rankings when he returns to the main professional tour next season.\nZhao, who won the UK title in 2021, is the first amateur to triumph at the Crucible.

It was nearly two years playing no competition, so my first target was to qualify. \n\"Now this will give them [children in China] power and in the future many Chinese players can do this.\"\nIt simply looked like a match too far for Williams, who overcame well-documented eye problems to reach a fifth final.\nHe appeared drained at times, following his semi-final success against world number one Judd Trump.\nThe 'Welsh Potting Machine' lost the two afternoon sessions by an aggregate score of 13-3 - a margin that proved too wide in a match which is sure to be viewed as a changing-of-the-guard moment.\n\"Unfortunately I was just never in the final from day one. I was behind from the start and could not get into it,\" said Williams.\n\"I said that if I could get out of the first session at 5-3 down it would have been a result, but I was 7-1 down and it was a bit far for me to get back. \n\"I've got nothing but admiration for what he's done, coming through the qualifiers.

        "article_text": "Rohit Sharma's abrupt retirement from Test cricket has jolted Indian fans, leaving the team without its captain and most seasoned opener just weeks before a pivotal five-Test series starts in England.\nIndia haven't won a Test rubber in England since 2007. To lose their captain and most experienced opening batter will compel a rethink of selection strategy for the tour.\nA charismatic leader and dashing batter, Sharma is widely regarded as a modern day great. \nHis stats in Test cricket \u2013 4,301 runs in 67 matches at an average of 40.57 are not imposing. \nBut the aplomb and authority, tactical acumen and lead-from-the-front derring-do which he has displayed has won him admiration and respect all over the cricket world.\nSharma's decision to retire from Test cricket, announced via a subdued Instagram post, has sparked widespread speculation. While various factors may have influenced his choice, his prolonged slump in Test form appears to be the primary catalyst.\nIn his last six Tests - three against New Zealand at home, three against Australia Down Under - Sharma's form was woeful. In 10 innings in these matches, he could muster a paltry 122 runs.\nTo compound the problem, India lost all these Tests. Being whitewashed by New Zealand 3-0 at home - unprecedented in Indian cricket - put Sharma under harsh scrutiny in the ensuing Border-Gavaskar series in which too he found no relief. He took the laudable, but extreme step of dropping himself from the playing XI for the last Test at Sydney.\nSince then, India won the ODI Champions Trophy in which Sharma's form was impressive. \nThe first few weeks of the ongoing IPL were disappointing but Sharma rediscovered his touch, playing important knocks to put his team Mumbai Indians strongly in the running for a place in the knockouts. But success in white-ball cricket is not necessarily an index to similar form being replicated in red-ball cricket.\nSharma is 38. His recent Test form has been ungratifying. The next World Test Championship cycle would take two years to complete. Did he have the physical wherewithal, the mental bandwidth, motivation and mojo to continue playing Test cricket? Questions he likely asked himself before calling it quits.\nSharma was the first among a clutch of talented batters emerging from the Under-19 pipeline in the first decade of this century. \nThe others were Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane. These four were to take over the mantle of India's batting responsibility from Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Saurav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag.\nIronically, while Sharma got the India cap first, in an ODI against Ireland in 2007, he was the last among this quartet to play Test cricket.\nHe was part of MS Dhoni's team which won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, but a Test place, which came relatively easily to Kohli, Pujara, Dhawan and Rahane, eluded him until Tendulkar's farewell series in 2013.\nOn debut at the Eden Gardens, Sharma made 177. In Tendulkar's swan song next match at the Wankhede, he made 111. These centuries were obscured by the overflowing of sentiment for Tendulkar, but Sharma's sublime skills, which often raised batsmanship to an art form, was not lost on experts.\nRavi Shastri, who was to have a huge influence on his Test career later by making him opener, likened him to a \"Swiss Watch\" for the precision timing in his strokeplay. Dilip Vengsarkar, former India captain who spotted him for India, highlights his ability to play late which helps in judging length of the ball quicker and better and also enables improvisation.\nThe style and finesse which made the likes of VVS Laxman and Mark Waugh so wonderful to watch were manifest in Sharma's batting from his earliest days as Test player.\nWeaned on the \"Bombay School'' of batting which boasts exemplars of orthodox technique like Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, Sharma's batting carries that strain. \nBut growing up in a post-modern milieu when risk-taking has become fundamental to batting in every format, Sharma shifted into higher gears far quicker, often from the start in Tests too once he was secure of his place.\nHe did not exhibit the bravado of a Sehwag, but when in full flow, he has often shown up the destructive ability of Viv Richards, especially when playing horizontal bat shots like hook, pull and cut.\n\nIt was not until 2019, when the then chief coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli coaxed and cajoled him to open the innings that Sharma's career in red-ball cricket bloomed.\nBy this time, he had smashed three ODI double centuries \u2013 apart from a spate of match-winning scores in T20 - establishing him as a Goliath in white-ball cricket.\nWhen he became India captain in 2021, Sharma set his sights on bagging a hat-trick of ICC trophies, and recast the team's playing strategy for each format accordingly.\nA genial, fun-loving bearing, marked by endearing earthiness helped him bond with his players easily and strongly. But he was no lax or loose on the field. He was astute, perceptive, intuitive in reading match situations, and particularly good in handling bowlers.\nFive IPL titles for Mumbai Indians bespoke his leadership credentials even before he got the job for the national team.\nUnder Sharma, India reached the World Test Championship final in 2023, only to lose to Australia. \nIn the ODI World Cup the same year, his blazing batting as opener, and his strategy of \"total attack\" in which the batsmen would go after runs unrelentingly, took India into to the final where their dreams were dashed by an inspired Australian side. Winning the T20 World Cup a few months later, was some recompense, but not complete redemption.\nIt is pertinent that Sharma, who quit T20 cricket after winning the World Cup last year, hasn't retired from ODI cricket yet.\nNot being part of an ODI World Cup winning team has been festering in him since 2011 when he was not selected in the squad under Dhoni that was to bring India glory after 28 years.\nIn an interview with podcaster Vimal Kumar released a few days back, he said that his desire to be part of an ODI World Cup winning team remains alive.\nThe next ODI World Cup is in 2027. Whether Sharma can sustain fitness and form over the two years will be followed with interest in the cricket world. \nBut that is hardly the concern of India's selectors. Right now, their worry is to find an opener and a captain to step into Sharma's big boots.",

Both claim Kashmir and have fought two wars over it.\nThere were calls for restraint from around the world after India launched \"Operation Sindoor\" early on Wednesday.  \nBut on Thursday both sides accused each other of further military action.\nPakistan's military spokesman said drones sent by India had been engaged in multiple locations.\n\"Last night, India showed another act of aggression by sending drones to multiple locations,\" Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. \"These locations are Lahore, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bahawalpur, Miano, Chor and near Karachi.\"\nHe said one civilian had been killed in Sindh province and four troops injured in Lahore.\nThe US consulate in Lahore told its staff to shelter in the building. \nIndia said its latest action had been taken in response to Pakistan's attempts to \"engage a number of military targets in northern and western India\" overnight.\n\"It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised,\" a Defence Ministry statement said. Pakistan denied the claim.\nThere was no independent confirmation of the two countries' versions of events.\nLater in the day India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a news conference in Delhi: \"Our intention has not been to escalate matters, we are only responding to the original escalation.\"\nMeanwhile, casualty numbers continue to rise. Pakistan says 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and firing along the Line of Control, since Wednesday morning.\nIndia's army said the number of people killed by Pakistani firing in the disputed Kashmir region had risen to 16, including three women and five children.\nIndia initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam but on 7 May it accused the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group of carrying it out.\nIndian police have alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a claim denied by Islamabad. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nIn a late-night address on Wednesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to avenge those killed in India's strikes.\nHe repeated Pakistan's claim that it had shot down five Indian fighter jets, saying that was a \"crushing response\". India has not commented on that claim.\nFollowing the reports of Thursday's explosions in Jammu, local media cited Indian military sources on Thursday in reporting that blasts across the Jammu region were also reported in the towns of  Akhnoor, Samba and Kathua.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. \nSpeaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while reducing reliance on China.\nTrump also said that $14bn would be invested in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he later told reporters he had yet to see or approve the final deal.\nThe announcement is the latest turn in Trump's rollercoaster approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January. \n\"There will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever, and every US steelworker will soon receive a well deserved $5,000 bonus,\" Trump told the crowd, filled with steelworkers, to raucous applause. \nOne of the major concerns from steelworkers about the US-Japan trade deal was how Japan would honour the workers' union contract which regulates pay and hiring. \nTrump began his remarks by saying he had \"saved\" US Steel, America's biggest steel manufacturer, located in Pittsburgh, with the 25% tariffs he implemented during his first term as president in 2018. \nBoth sales and profits at US Steel have been falling in recent years.  \nTrump touted the increase to 50% as a way to ensure US Steel's survival. \n\"At 50%, they can no longer get over the fence,\" he said. \"We are once again going to put Pennsylvania steel into the backbone of America, like never before.\"\nUS steel manufacturing has been declining in recent years, and China, India and Japan have pulled ahead as the world's top producers. Roughly a quarter of all steel used in the US is imported, and the country's reliance on Mexican and Canadian steel has angered Trump.\nThe announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue after the Court of International Trade ordered the administration to halt the taxes. \nHis tariffs on steel and aluminium were untouched by the lawsuit.\n\"It is a good day for steelworkers,\" JoJo Burgess, a member of the local United Steelworkers union who was at Trump's rally, told the BBC. \nMr Burgess, who is also the city mayor of nearby Washington, Pennsylvania, expressed optimism over the reported details of the partnership with Nippon Steel, saying he hoped it would help breed a new generation of steel workers in the area. \nHe recalled \"making a lot of money\" in the years after Trump instituted steel tariffs in his first term.\nAlthough Burgess would not label himself a Trump supporter, and says he has only voted for Democratic nominees for president in the last two decades, he said: \"I'm never going to disagree with something that's going to level the playing field for American manufacturing.\" \nBut so far the impacts of Trump's tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos. Global trade and markets have been upended and cracks have formed - or widened - in relations between the US and other countries, including some of its closest partners. \nThe levies have strained relations between China and the US, the world's two biggest global economies, and launched the countries into a tit-for-tat trade battle.\nOn Friday, without providing details, Trump accused China of violating a truce they had reached over tariffs earlier this month over talks in Geneva.\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer later clarified that China had not been removing non-tariff barriers as agreed under the deal.\nChina then shot back with its own accusations of US wrongdoing. Beijing's response on Friday did not address the US claims directly but urged the US to \"cease discriminatory restrictions against China\".\nChina is the world's largest manufacturer of steel, responsible for more than half of global steel production, according to World Steel Association statistics from 2022.\n\"If you don't have steel, you don't have a country. You don't have a country, you can't make a military. What are we going to do? Say, 'Let's go to China to get our steel from the army tanks,'\" Trump quipped at the Pittsburgh rally on Friday.\nTrump's roughly hour-long, wide-ranging rally speech hinted at the deal he said he had made with Japan's Nippon Steel but he did not offer any new details. Both companies have not confirmed any deal was completed.\nUS Steel agreed in December 2023 to be taken over by Nippon in a deal valued at $15bn before it was eventually blocked by President Joe Biden on national security grounds. \nWhile campaigning for president, Trump had said he was \"totally against\" US Steel being taken over by a \"foreign company\". \nHe also said he would \"block it instantaneously\", describing the takeover by Nippon as \"so terrible\".\nUnder the reported new \"partnership\", it is not clear who would own US Steel or who would operate the 124-year-old American business.\nWhite House officials said Trump had convinced Nippon to boost its investment in the US and give the government key say over the operations of the US factories. \nAccording to US media, Japan plans to invest $14bn over 14 months. \nOther reported details include that the companies had said they would maintain ownership of US steel in the US, with US citizens on the board and in leadership positions; pledged not to cut production for 10 years; and agreed to give the government the right to veto potential production cuts after that period.",

        "article_text": "As the annual Hajj pilgrimage draws to a close, a long-settled corner of Mecca is stirring up a storm thousands of miles away in India - not for its spiritual significance, but for a 50-year-old inheritance dispute.\nAt the heart of the controversy is Keyi Rubath, a 19th-Century guest house built in the 1870s by Mayankutty Keyi, a wealthy Indian merchant from Malabar (modern-day Kerala), whose trading empire stretched from Mumbai to Paris.\nLocated near Islam's holiest site, Masjid al-Haram, the building was demolished in 1971 to make way for Mecca's expansion. Saudi authorities deposited 1.4 million riyals (about $373,000 today) in the kingdom's treasury as compensation, but said no rightful heir could be identified at the time.\nDecades later, that sum - still held in Saudi Arabia's treasury - has sparked a bitter  tussle between two sprawling branches of the Keyi family, each trying to prove its lineage and claim what they see as their rightful inheritance.\nNeither side has succeeded so far. For decades, successive Indian governments - both at the Centre and in Kerala - have tried and failed to resolve the deadlock.\nIt remains unclear if Saudi authorities are even willing to release the compensation, let alone adjust it for inflation as some family members now demand -  with some claiming it could be worth over $1bn today. \nFollowers of the case note the property was a waqf - an Islamic charitable endowment - meaning descendants can manage but not own it.\nThe Saudi department that handles Awqaf (endowed properties) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, and the government has made no public statement on the matter.\nThat hasn't stopped speculation - about both the money and who it rightfully belongs to.\nLittle is known about the guest house itself, but descendants claim it stood just steps from the Masjid al-Haram, with 22 rooms and several halls spread over 1.5 acres. \nAccording to family lore, Keyi shipped wood from Malabar to build it and appointed a Malabari manager to run it - an ambitious gesture, though not unusual for the time. \nSaudi Arabia was a relatively poor country back then - the discovery of its massive oil fields still a few decades away.\nThe Hajj pilgrimage and the city's importance in Islam meant that Indian Muslims often donated money or built infrastructure for Indian pilgrims there.\nIn his 2014 book, Mecca: The Sacred City, historian Ziauddin Sardar notes that during the second half of the 18th Century, the city had acquired a distinctively Indian character with its economy and financial well-being dependent on Indian Muslims.\n\"Almost 20% of the city's inhabitants, the largest single majority, were now of Indian origins \u2013 people from Gujarat, Punjab, Kashmir and Deccan, all collectively known locally as the Hindis,\" Sardar wrote.\nAs Saudi Arabia's oil wealth surged in the 20th century, sweeping development projects reshaped Mecca. Keyi Rubath was demolished three times, the final time in the early 1970s.\nThat's when the confusion around compensation appears to have started. \nAccording to BM Jamal, former secretary of India's Central Waqf Council, the Indian consulate in Jeddah wrote to the government back then, seeking details of Mayankutty Keyi's legal heir. \n\"In my understanding, authorities were looking for the descendants to appoint a manager for the property, not to distribute the compensation money,\" Mr Jamal said.\nNonetheless, two factions stepped forward: the Keyis - Mayankutty's paternal family - and the Arakkals, a royal family from Kerala into which he had married. \nBoth families traditionally followed a matrilineal inheritance system -  a custom not recognized under Saudi law, adding further complexity.\nThe Keyis claim that Mayankutty died childless, making his sister's children his rightful heirs under matrilineal tradition. \nBut the Arakkals claim he had a son and a daughter, and therefore, under Indian law, his children would be the legal inheritors.\nAs the dispute dragged on, the story took on a life of its own. In 2011, after rumours swirled that the compensation could be worth millions, more than 2,500 people flooded a district office in Kannur, claiming to be Keyi's descendants.\n\"There were people who claimed that their forefathers had taught Mayankutty in his childhood. Others claimed that their forefathers had provided timber for the guest house,\" a senior Keyi family member, who wanted to stay anonymous, told the BBC.\nScams followed. State officials say in 2017 fraudsters posing as Keyi descendants duped locals into handing over money, promising a share of the compensation.  \nToday, the case remains unresolved. \nSome descendants propose the best way to end the dispute would be to ask the Saudi government to use the compensation money to build another guest house for Hajj pilgrims, as Myankutti Keyi had intended.\nBut others reject this, arguing that the guest house was privately owned, and so any compensation rightfully belongs to the family.\nSome argue that even if the family proves lineage to Mayankutty Keyi, without ownership documents, they're unlikely to gain anything.\nFor Muhammed Shihad, a Kannur resident who has co-authored a book on the history of the Keyi and Arakkal families, though, the dispute is not just about the money - but about honouring the family's roots. \n\"If they don't get the compensation, it would be worth openly recognising the family's and the region's connection to this noble act.\"",

        "article_text": "On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape \u2013 from what was the US's most secure prison \u2013 continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime.\nIn May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made \"the most feared journey in the criminal world\" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed \"the Rock\", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped.\nIn the news\nOn 4 May, US president Donald Trump said, in a post on his Truth Social site, that he would call for the reopening of Alcatraz, the once-notorious island prison which now serves as a tourist site in the San Francisco Bay. He wrote that it would become \"a symbol of law, order and justice\". Read more by BBC News's Gabriela Pomeroy, here.\nAlcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\". \"Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,\" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it.\nFour years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night.\nWhen the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. \"A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,\" he said. \"Built over the rambling passages of an old fort\u2026 the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up.\"\nWith Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood.\nBut while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How D-Day began with a death-defying mission\n\u2022 The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness\n\u2022 Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\nFinally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it\u00a0\u2013 carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower\u00a0\u2013 shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered.\nThe island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. \"When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,\" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. \"I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was.\"\nThe prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again.\u00a0\nAlthough the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964.\" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,\" he said. \"Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?\"\nAlcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: \"the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nOver the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves \u2013 unable to face the unrelenting conditions \u2013 and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment.\nAs for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service.\nBut speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them.\u00a0\nIn 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read \"I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!\" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not.\nThe case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.\u00a0\nThis article was originally published on 10 June 2024 and has been republished.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.\n\"Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,\" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. \n\"But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.\"\nShe had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. \nMoving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.\nLovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.\n\"Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,\" Lovina jokes. \"I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.\"\nSo she posted an open message on her Facebook account: \"Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?\"\nTo her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.\nShe quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.\n\"I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,\" she says. \"I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.\"\nLovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. \nAccording to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. \nIndians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.\nFollowing that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. \nShortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.\nLovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupra\u2060, Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. \nThey say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.\nThe community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. \nThey say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. \nA member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.\n\"The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,\" she says.\nBeyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. \nIn one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. \nNishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.\n\"The group was her first port of call,\" says Nishi. \"As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.\"\nAnother woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.\n\"I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,\" Priya says.\n\"Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused.\" \nSo she asked the group and they offered advice.\nPriya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.\n\"The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,\" says Priya. \"I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.\"\nThere has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. \nLovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.\n\"I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,\" says Lovina.\n\"I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.\"\nLovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. \nIt has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation.\nThe World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority.\nThe members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.\n\"We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,\" says Lovina. \"I think that's the biggest support system for us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India Company gradually transformed into a colonial power. \nBy the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, Company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling.\nA Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of Company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists.\nPainted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs.\n\"The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes,\" says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show.\n\"Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them,  and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met \u2013 or at least observed \u2013 multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but \u2013 as they began to discern \u2013 were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice.\"\nBeyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. \nBefore photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists.\nBeyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb.\nThe once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. \nFrom June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)\nThe largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). \nWhile Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it.\nOriginally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801.\n\"The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century,\" writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. \n\"These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected.\"\nAnother painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. \nAt the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. \nLabeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.\nBy the late 18th Century, Company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. \nArt historian Mildred Archer called them a \"fascinating record of Indian social life,\" blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. \nRegional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers.\n\"They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life,\" says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.\nMost studies of Company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. \nA striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800.\nOne painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue.\nAmong the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting  boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats.\nWith no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.\nCompany paintings often featured natural history studies, portraying birds, animals, and plants - especially from private menageries. \nAs seen in the DAG show, these subjects are typically shown life-size against plain white backgrounds, with minimal surroundings - just the occasional patch of grass. The focus remains firmly on the species itself.\nAshish Anand, CEO of DAG, says the the latest show proposes Company paintings as the \"starting point of Indian modernism\".\nAnand says this \"was the moment when Indian artists who had trained in courtly ateliers first moved outside the court (and the temple) to work for new patrons\". \n\"The agendas of those patrons were not tied up with courtly or religious concerns; they were founded on scientific enquiry and observation,\" he says. \n\"Never mind that the patrons were foreigners. What should strike us now is how Indian artists responded to their demands, creating entirely new templates of Indian art.\"",

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri claimed victory in Miami to make it three wins in a row, beating team-mate Lando Norris in a McLaren one-two.\nPiastri now leads the drivers' championship by 16 points from Norris.\nMeanwhile, Ferrari were embroiled in a controversy over team orders after Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc were both asked to swap positions.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions after the Miami Grand Prix.\nWhat on earth is wrong at Ferrari? - Jonathan\nAfter the Miami Grand Prix, the questions in Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur's news conference focused largely on the team orders debate between the team and drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc during the race.\nVasseur became a little frustrated with this, and in the end said: \"It's not the story of the day,\" pointing out that the only difference it made in the end was which driver finished seventh and eighth.\n\"I would be much more keen to speak about why we finished one minute behind McLaren,\" he said.\nVasseur claimed that in the race, the car's pace was a match for the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the Mercedes, but Ferrari paid the price for their poor grid positions. McLaren, he admitted, were \"on another planet\".\nCharles Leclerc qualified eighth and Lewis Hamilton 12th, Ferrari's worst qualifying result of the season, and that was largely because they were struggling to get the best out of new tyres.\nThat's why Hamilton and Leclerc ran on used tyres in the second set of qualifying. As Vasseur put it: \"Everybody improved 0.5-0.6secs between scrubbed to new and we lost 0.2-0.3secs.\"\nAsked why Ferrari struggled with tyres in Miami, he said: \"That's a good question. If I knew the answer, I would do a step forward and we would have fixed it between Q2 and Q3.\n\"You always have to operate the tyres in a very narrow window. It's different from track to track, it's different from compound to compound, from track temp to track temp. And it's always after the session that you say, 'OK, I could have done differently.'\"\nBut that was just Miami. The wider issue is that the car is not where Ferrari expected it to be at the start of this season, after running McLaren so close for the constructors' title last year. \nOther teams - especially McLaren - made more progress over the winter, and Ferrari simply need to make the car faster.\nOn average, it is the slowest of the top four teams, and Ferrari have scored only one grand prix podium, thanks to Leclerc in Saudi Arabia.\nHamilton won the sprint in China, but that seems to be a case of him and the team finding a good set-up after just one practice session, while others did not, and then benefiting from clean air at the start of the race.\nAs Leclerc put it: \"Lewis did an outstanding job. Maybe some drivers didn't put everything together in (sprint) qualifying and he managed to do that and managed to outperform the car a bit. \n\"Then tyre degradation being a big thing, when you start in front, everything comes to you a bit more. Lewis made a difference on Friday and Saturday.\"\nThere are what Vasseur calls \"some small upgrades\" coming at the next two races in Imola and Monaco. And Vasseur hopes that the stricter rules on front wing deflection that are being introduced at the subsequent race in Spain will make a difference. \n\"Everybody will have a new front wing in Barcelona,\" he said. \"By definition and by regulation. I think it will be perhaps a reset of the performance of everybody.\"\nThe implication is that McLaren are benefiting from exploiting this phenomenon. McLaren themselves say they expect it to make little difference to them.\nFerrari progressed well with upgrades in both 2023 and 2024 after difficult starts. Vasseur remains confident they can do the same this year.\nHamilton said on Sunday: \"I feel optimistic for the future. I think this car really does have performance. Something's holding us back at the moment. We've lost performance since China. And it's there, it's just we can't use it. Until we get a fix for that, then this is where we are.\"\n'Fire in my belly' led to team orders controversy - Hamilton\nVerstappen 'not racing very smart' - Norris\nIs the risk that Mercedes took bringing Kimi Antonelli into the team now rather than later paying off? \u2013 Callum\nKimi Antonelli had had a steady start to his debut Formula 1 season, as he said was his plan from the start - he wanted to build steadily and not make big errors.\nIn Miami, the 18-year-old for the first time showed a glimpse of the high potential Mercedes believed him to have, and which persuaded them to throw him in at the deep end this year.\nHe was confident in the car from the start, and he was always the faster Mercedes driver over one lap.\nPole for the sprint race was an outstanding performance, and he repeated it with third on the grid for the grand prix. Neither race went as well, but team principal Toto Wolff believes that was evidence of Antonelli's continued need to learn in the complex world of F1.\nWolff described the qualifying performances as \"another proof of his talent and a good indication of how the future can be\".\nHe added: \"In the race, challenging, because it's so difficult here to find the right reference. The medium (tyre) stint, quick enough, you know, with George (Russell) holding on in the back on the hard tyre.\n\"And then when he went into the hard, he just lacked experience managing it the right way.\n\"(We're) finding the right references and trying to guide him, but when you're in that car, it's not easy. It's just part of the learning curve.\"\nWolff always said that it would take time for Antonelli to adapt to F1, and that's the way it is working out.\nAntonelli has a long way to go before he proves he is the generational talent Mercedes - and others who have worked with him in the junior categories - believe him to be, but Miami was a good step in the right direction.\nKimi Antonelli finished sixth in the main grand prix in Miami and seventh in the sprint race\nHow can Fernando Alonso turn his season around, having not scored a single point up until now? \u2013 Andrew\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso is not having his best season, and it's highly unusual to see that he has scored no points while team-mate Lance Stroll has scored 14 points and is 10th in the championship.\nThe bottom line is that the Aston Martin is a poor car. Alonso has made a couple of mistakes, but fundamentally he has been unlucky and Stroll has benefited from circumstances.\nAlonso is still comfortably faster than the Canadian - the two-time champion is 7-1 ahead across all qualifying sessions at an average advantage of 0.321 seconds.\nHe was driving well in Australia in the wet in an impressive sixth place, but crashed on gravel at Turn Six. The chaos in the race helped Stroll, driving well, to move up and claim that sixth place.\nStroll then benefited from the disqualification of both Ferraris in China, and was promoted to ninth place. There, Alonso retired early on with his brakes on fire.\nStroll benefited again from the chaos in the Miami sprint, where Alonso was driving well and on course for points when he was taken out in a crash with Liam Lawson.\nHis spin in the grand prix, while uncharacteristic, \"didn't change anything,\" he said. \n\"I lost five seconds and then 10 laps later I catch the same group of cars and was still in the same place and then benefited from the virtual safety car. \n\"Even with that, not enough (pace) to be closer to the cars in front today. We need to get better for Imola. We are not happy being at this pace but we are all trying the best we can.\"\nAston Martin team boss Andy Cowell praised Alonso's qualifying performance in Japan as \"outstanding\" and in Jeddah as \"impressive\".

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

        "article_text": "In his 1983 science fiction story, an Indian astrophysicist predicted what schools would look like in 2050. \nJayant Narlikar envisioned a scene where an alien, living among humans, would sit in front of a screen and attend online classes. The aliens are yet to manifest, but online classes became a reality for students far sooner, in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\nNarlikar also famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang Theory - the popular idea that the universe was created in a single moment from a single point. He believed that the universe had always existed, expanding continuously into infinity.\nWith his passing on Tuesday, India lost one of its most celebrated astrophysicists. Narlikar was 86 - a man far ahead of his times and someone who shaped a generation of Indian researchers through his lifelong dedication to science education.\nHis funeral was attended by hundreds, from school children to renowned scientists and even his housekeeping staff, underscoring the profound impact he had on society.\nBorn on 19 July, 1938, in the town of Kolhapur in the western state of Maharashtra, Narlikar was raised in a home steeped in academic tradition. \nHis father, Vishnu Narlikar, was a professor and mathematician, and mother Sumati was a scholar of the Sanskrit language.\nFollowing in his parents footsteps, the studious Narlikar went to Cambridge University for higher studies where topped a highly prestigious mathematical course. He also took a deep interest in astrophysics and cosmology.\nBut his most significant episode at Cambridge was his association with his PhD guide, physicist Sir Fred Hoyle. Together, Narlikar and Hoyle laid the groundwork for a revolutionary alternative to the popular Big Bang theory.\nThe two physicists contested the Big Bang Theory, which posits that all matter and energy in the universe came into existence in one single instance about 13.8 billion years ago.\nThe Hoyle-Narlikar theory boldly proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe. Their theory was based on what they called a quasi-steady state model.\nIn his autobiography, My Tale of Four Cities, Narlikar used a banking analogy to explain the theory. \n\"To understand this concept better, think of capital invested in a bank which offers a fixed rate of compound interest. That is, the interest accrued is constantly added to the capital which therefore grows too, along with the interest.\" \nHe explained that the universe expanded like the capital with compound interest. However, as the name 'steady state' implies, the universe always looks the same to the observer.\nAstronomer Somak Raychaudhury says that though Narlikar's theory isn't as popular as the Big Bang, it is still useful.\n\"He advanced mechanisms by which matter could be continually created and destroyed in an infinite universe,\" Raychaudhary said. \n\"While the Big Bang model gained broader acceptance, many tools developed for the steady-state model remain useful today,\" he added\nRaychaudhary recollects that even after Hoyle began to entertain elements of the Big Bang theory, Narlikar remained committed to the steady-state theory. \nA sign outside his office fittingly stated: \"The Big Bang is an exploding myth.\"\nNarlikar stayed in the UK till 1971 as a Fellow at King's College and a founding member of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy. \nAs he shot to global fame in the astrophysics circles, the science community in India took note of his achievements.\nIn 1972, he returned to India and immediately took charge of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the coveted Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, which he led it till 1989.\nBut his biggest contribution to India was the creation of an institution dedicated to cutting-edge research and the democratisation of science.\nThis dream materialised in 1988, when Narlikar, along with other distinguished scientists, founded the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune city in western India.\nFrom a modest 100sq ft room, IUCAA has gone on to become an internationally respected institution for astronomy and astrophysics. \nNarlikar served as its founder-director till 2003, and continued to be an emeritus professor after that.\nHe insisted that IUCAA should include programs aimed at school children and the general public. Monthly lectures, science camps, and workshops became regular events.\nRecalling Narlikar's vision for the institution, science educator Arvind Gupta says, \"He said PhD scholars don't fall from the sky, you must catch them young. He offered me a place to stay, told me to try running the children's science centre for six months, and I ended up staying 11 years. He gave me wings to fly.\"\nDespite being a prolific scholar who published over 300 research papers, Narlikar never confined himself to being just a scientist. He also authored many science fiction books that have been translated into multiple languages.\nThese stories were often grounded in scientific principles.\nIn a story called Virus, published in 2015, he envisioned a pandemic taking over the world; his 1986 book Waman Parat Na Ala (The Return of Vaman), tackled the ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence.\nSanjeev Dhurandhar, who was part of the Indian team that contributed to the physical detection of gravitational waves in 2015, recalled how Narlikar inspired him to attempt the unthinkable.\n\"He gave me a complex problem early in my research. After I struggled for a week, he solved it on the board in 15 minutes - not to show superiority, but to guide and inspire. His openness to gravitational waves was what gave me the courage to pursue it.\"\nA well-known rationalist, Narlikar also took it upon himself to challenge pseudoscience. In 2008, he co-authored a paper that challenged astrology using a statistical method.\nRaychaudhary said that his motivation to challenge pseudoscience came from the belief system of questioning everything that did not have a scientific basis. \nBut when it came to science, Narlikar believed in exploring the slimmest of possibilities.\nIn his last days, Narlikar continued doing what he loved most - replying to children's letters and writing about science on his blog.

        "article_text": "It's a grim paradox, doctors say.\nOn the one hand, antibiotics are being overused until they no longer work, driving resistance and fuelling the rise of deadly superbugs. On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.\nA new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.\nIndia bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  \nCommon in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. \nThey can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.\n\"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups,\" says Dr Abdul Gaffar, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. \"We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die.\"\nThe irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.\n\"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need,\" says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.\nThe study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. \nResearchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. \nFor example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. \nWhat prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? \nPhysicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.\n\"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all,\" says Dr Gaffar. \"We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do.\"\nTo improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. \n\"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist,\" says Dr Gaffar. \"Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice.\"\nTo fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.\nIndia bears one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.\n\"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics,\" says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from promising new antibiotics to advanced diagnostics.\nDr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. \nThis would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. \nInnovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a \"hub-and-spoke approach\" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programs, researchers say.\nWithout access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. \n\"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access,\" says Dr Gaffar. \"When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients.\" \nClearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.",

Stokes also claimed his comments were \"twisted to suit an agenda\".Since then, Bethell has further impressed in England's one-day team, making a sparkling 82 in the first ODI against West Indies.Stokes at least seemed to confirm that England's choice would be between Bethell and Pope, rather than opener Zak Crawley or spinner Shoaib Bashir being candidates to be left out.Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamSurreyWarwickshireCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January His next target would be to play for Sussex in the County Championship before the end of this month.Warwickshire's Bethell impressed in three Tests in New Zealand before Christmas, making half-centuries in the second innings of each, batting at number three.When he missed the Test against Zimbabwe, England were spared the decision on whether to include him in their team and reverted back to their established top seven.

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "In his 1983 science fiction story, an Indian astrophysicist predicted what schools would look like in 2050. \nJayant Narlikar envisioned a scene where an alien, living among humans, would sit in front of a screen and attend online classes. The aliens are yet to manifest, but online classes became a reality for students far sooner, in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.\nNarlikar also famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang Theory - the popular idea that the universe was created in a single moment from a single point. He believed that the universe had always existed, expanding continuously into infinity.\nWith his passing on Tuesday, India lost one of its most celebrated astrophysicists. Narlikar was 86 - a man far ahead of his times and someone who shaped a generation of Indian researchers through his lifelong dedication to science education.\nHis funeral was attended by hundreds, from school children to renowned scientists and even his housekeeping staff, underscoring the profound impact he had on society.\nBorn on 19 July, 1938, in the town of Kolhapur in the western state of Maharashtra, Narlikar was raised in a home steeped in academic tradition. \nHis father, Vishnu Narlikar, was a professor and mathematician, and mother Sumati was a scholar of the Sanskrit language.\nFollowing in his parents footsteps, the studious Narlikar went to Cambridge University for higher studies where topped a highly prestigious mathematical course. He also took a deep interest in astrophysics and cosmology.\nBut his most significant episode at Cambridge was his association with his PhD guide, physicist Sir Fred Hoyle. Together, Narlikar and Hoyle laid the groundwork for a revolutionary alternative to the popular Big Bang theory.\nThe two physicists contested the Big Bang Theory, which posits that all matter and energy in the universe came into existence in one single instance about 13.8 billion years ago.\nThe Hoyle-Narlikar theory boldly proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe. Their theory was based on what they called a quasi-steady state model.\nIn his autobiography, My Tale of Four Cities, Narlikar used a banking analogy to explain the theory. \n\"To understand this concept better, think of capital invested in a bank which offers a fixed rate of compound interest. That is, the interest accrued is constantly added to the capital which therefore grows too, along with the interest.\" \nHe explained that the universe expanded like the capital with compound interest. However, as the name 'steady state' implies, the universe always looks the same to the observer.\nAstronomer Somak Raychaudhury says that though Narlikar's theory isn't as popular as the Big Bang, it is still useful.\n\"He advanced mechanisms by which matter could be continually created and destroyed in an infinite universe,\" Raychaudhary said. \n\"While the Big Bang model gained broader acceptance, many tools developed for the steady-state model remain useful today,\" he added\nRaychaudhary recollects that even after Hoyle began to entertain elements of the Big Bang theory, Narlikar remained committed to the steady-state theory. \nA sign outside his office fittingly stated: \"The Big Bang is an exploding myth.\"\nNarlikar stayed in the UK till 1971 as a Fellow at King's College and a founding member of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy. \nAs he shot to global fame in the astrophysics circles, the science community in India took note of his achievements.\nIn 1972, he returned to India and immediately took charge of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the coveted Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, which he led it till 1989.\nBut his biggest contribution to India was the creation of an institution dedicated to cutting-edge research and the democratisation of science.\nThis dream materialised in 1988, when Narlikar, along with other distinguished scientists, founded the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune city in western India.\nFrom a modest 100sq ft room, IUCAA has gone on to become an internationally respected institution for astronomy and astrophysics. \nNarlikar served as its founder-director till 2003, and continued to be an emeritus professor after that.\nHe insisted that IUCAA should include programs aimed at school children and the general public. Monthly lectures, science camps, and workshops became regular events.\nRecalling Narlikar's vision for the institution, science educator Arvind Gupta says, \"He said PhD scholars don't fall from the sky, you must catch them young. He offered me a place to stay, told me to try running the children's science centre for six months, and I ended up staying 11 years. He gave me wings to fly.\"\nDespite being a prolific scholar who published over 300 research papers, Narlikar never confined himself to being just a scientist. He also authored many science fiction books that have been translated into multiple languages.\nThese stories were often grounded in scientific principles.\nIn a story called Virus, published in 2015, he envisioned a pandemic taking over the world; his 1986 book Waman Parat Na Ala (The Return of Vaman), tackled the ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence.\nSanjeev Dhurandhar, who was part of the Indian team that contributed to the physical detection of gravitational waves in 2015, recalled how Narlikar inspired him to attempt the unthinkable.\n\"He gave me a complex problem early in my research. After I struggled for a week, he solved it on the board in 15 minutes - not to show superiority, but to guide and inspire. His openness to gravitational waves was what gave me the courage to pursue it.\"\nA well-known rationalist, Narlikar also took it upon himself to challenge pseudoscience. In 2008, he co-authored a paper that challenged astrology using a statistical method.\nRaychaudhary said that his motivation to challenge pseudoscience came from the belief system of questioning everything that did not have a scientific basis. \nBut when it came to science, Narlikar believed in exploring the slimmest of possibilities.\nIn his last days, Narlikar continued doing what he loved most - replying to children's letters and writing about science on his blog.

The vehicle is currently in Bethlehem, and will enter Gaza if and when Israel opens a humanitarian corridor.\nThe war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 15,000 children and displaced nearly one million since it erupted in October 2023, Unicef reports. \nIsrael has blocked humanitarian aid from entering the Strip for more than two months, which has left \"families struggling to survive\" as food, clean water and medicines reach critically low levels, the UN agency for children said.\nFor now, Caritas will have to wait until Israel reopens the aid corridor - but when that happens, they say they will be ready.\n\"With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to health care \u2013 children who are injured and malnourished,\" Peter Brune, Secretary General of Caritas Sweden, said in a statement.\nA team of doctors will run the mobile clinic, which will have the capabilities to examine and treat patients, and there will be a dedicated driver. Some details are still being finalised, like how to make the vehicle safe from potential blasts, Mr Brune told the BBC.\n\"It's not just a vehicle, it's a message that the world has not forgotten about the children in Gaza,\" he said.\nThroughout his pontificate, Pope Francis made many impassioned remarks on the war in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Strip \"shamefull\". During his final speech on Easter Sunday, he urged all \"warring parties\" to agree to a ceasefire and spoke of the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis. \nDuring 18 months of war, he reportedly called parishioners in Gaza nightly to check on their wellbeing, and suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide \u2013 an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.\nThe popemobile is one of a number of specially converted vehicles allowing the pontiff to greet huge crowds of well-wishers during official visits. He was able to sit or stand while it rolled along, flanked by security agents, and its design allowed those gathered to have a clear view of the Pope. \nPopemobiles in the past were bullet-proof after an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981, but Francis told Spanish media in 2014 that he didn't like the glass \"sardine can\" design that separated him from people.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages.\nIsrael's military campaign has killed at least 52,243 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Monday, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved, in principle, a plan to resume deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid through private companies, but the UN and other aid agencies said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.",

        "article_text": "Plans to turn land being used for the production of food into farms harvesting the power of the sun often see campaigns fought through the planning process.\nFor some these glimmering, undulating landscapes of panels are now as much a part of the countryside as the fields they inhabit, but for others, the feeling is they are totally at odds with it.\nHeading out of the Leicestershire market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch on almost any of its roads, once you pass a handful of entrances to housing estates of varying ages, you arrive in the National Forest countryside.\nOn a sunny spring morning, it is a glorious place to be.\nBut around Ashby these open spaces are not a green wedge, so much as a buffer of fields covered in panels harvesting green energy.\nWalking along the roadside in Shellbrook, on the western edge of the town, the chirpy song of chiffchaffs, blackcaps and robins in the hedgerows now mixes with the buzz of kit working away inside the green metal boxes behind the chain link fencing beyond them.\nOne homeowner nearby said they had not objected but were now living with the hum of the solar farm nearby, while one man living near to Ashby's biggest collection of panels, who did not wish to be named, told me all solar farms \"need a bomb putting under them\".\nHe fumed that having one on his doorstep had devalued his property, and that acres upon acres of \"valuable farmland\" were lost to the scheme.\nThese are arguments routinely put to planning officers and council committees the length and breadth of the country - that these renewable schemes lead to the loss of productive farmland, and come at a cost to the look of the landscape.\nThese battles are fought increasingly regularly, some are won by developers, and some are lost. But when the dust settles and one is built, what is it really like?\nFor more of the Ashby residents I spoke to, where the panels were mostly put in about a decade ago, there are drawbacks, despite most people having much less incendiary views on the solar farms next door.\nBut the overall consensus was - they do not really bother them.\nJohn Gillespie, 41, said the solar panels a stone's throw from his house were not flagged when he bought his home recently, and having them nearby had not affected him.\nHe said: \"As the population grows, we need more energy. There's a lot of empty fields, I don't think it's harming anyone.\"\nShellbrook resident Liz Bark, 54, said: \"When they built it we were concerned what it could look like, but it's fine.\n\"When you walk around the wooded area you can hear it but it doesn't bother us at home.\n\"It's quite nice to see that the ground is still being used.

I don't think there were any written objections and I went to the council meeting, in which it was dealt with very quickly and without objections.\"\nThe government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that solar was \"at the heart\" of work to generate green energy.\nA spokesperson said: \"As of September last year, solar farms covered around 0.1% of the total land area of the UK, while bringing huge benefits for the British public and our energy security.\n\"Projects are subject to a rigorous planning process, in which the views and interests of the local community and impacts on the local environment, including any impact on amenities, landscapes and land use, are considered.\"\nWhile solar farms on fields are not set to disappear - especially those already built with lifetimes in their decades - the future of solar may be starting to move up towards the rooftops of the UK.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is set to publish new guidance on homebuilding \"later this year\", it said, which would \"maximise the installation of solar panels on new homes\".\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Tesla - we are not expecting from them,\" Kumaraswamy said. \nAnother official told the Press Trust of India news agency that a Tesla representative had participated in the first round of stakeholder discussions for the manufacturing scheme but  \"was not part of the second and third round\".\nThe comments come on the back of US President Donald Trump saying in February that it would be \"unfair\" for the US if Tesla built a factory in India. \nOver the years Tesla has had several rounds of negotiations to enter India.\nThe company's original plans to open a base were shelved in 2022 after the Indian government insisted that Tesla make cars locally. The carmaker had said it wanted to export to India first so that it could test demand.\nIn 2023, Musk said he was \"trying to figure out the right timing\" to invest in the Indian market.\nMusk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year in Washington DC where the two discussed the \"immense potential\" for collaboration in technology and innovation.\nLast year India cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (\u00a3369m) and starting local production within three years. This came after Musk complained that high import duties were preventing the carmaker from entering India. \nBut analysts say the Indian EV market may not be mature enough yet for Tesla to invest locally - EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India, and locally made alternatives can cost half of what consumers will have to shell out for Tesla's base model. \nCharging infrastructure and local road conditions could be further deterrents. \nIndia's Tata Motors currently leads India's EV market with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. \nGlobally, Tesla has been facing growing competition from Chinese players such as BYD. \nIts sales plummeted to their lowest level in three years in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk and his role in the Trump administration. \nMusk announced his departure from his government role last week.

The carmaker had said it wanted to export to India first so that it could test demand.In 2023, Musk said he was \"trying to figure out the right timing\" to invest in the Indian market.Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year in Washington DC where the two discussed the \"immense potential\" for collaboration in technology and innovation.Last year India cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (\u00a3369m) and starting local production within three years. But analysts say the Indian EV market may not be mature enough yet for Tesla to invest locally - EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India, and locally made alternatives can cost half of what consumers will have to shell out for Tesla's base model. Minister HD Kumaraswamy confirmed that Tesla would open two showrooms in India and have a retail presence.",

        "article_text": "A judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol foreign students.\nThe ruling came after Harvard filed a lawsuit - the latest escalation of a dispute between the White House and one of America's most prestigious institutions. \nThe university said the administration's decision on Thursday to bar international students was a \"blatant violation\" of the law and free speech rights.\nThe Trump administration says Harvard has not done enough to fight antisemitism, and change its hiring and admissions practices \u2013 allegations that the university has strongly denied.\nUS District Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order in a short ruling issued on Friday. \nThe order pauses a move that the Department of Homeland Security made on Thursday to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) - a government database that manages foreign students.\nThe next hearing will occur on 29 May in Boston.\n\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard argued in the lawsuit.\n\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Harvard President Alan Garber said in a letter.\n\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he wrote.\nIn response, White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said: \"If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with. \nAfter the restraining order was issued, Ms Jackson accused the judge in the case of having a \"liberal agenda\". \n\"These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy,\" she said. \nIt was quiet at Harvard on Friday. Classes have finished for the year and preparations are being made for commencements. Gazebos were going up on the quad as students rented their gowns and collected tickets for family members. \nFor those graduating, it should be a week of celebration. But for foreign students hoping to remain in the US, it's been a 24-hour whirlwind.\nAll morning Harvard's international student body scrambled to find out what was going to happen. Would they have to leave the US immediately? Were they now under the threat of deportation?\nCormac Savage from Downpatrick in Co Down Northern Ireland is six days from graduating with a degree in government and languages. He's taking a job in Brussels, partly because of the uncertainty in the US.\n\"You know that you're fine if you're still legally in the United States for the next 90 days, but you don't know that you can come back and finish your degree,\" he said on Friday. \"You don't know if you can stay and work in the US if you're about to graduate.\nThe order also complicates plans for students still enroled, like Rohan Battula, a junior from the UK who will rely on his visa to work in New York in June.\n\"I was worried if I went home I wouldn't get to come back,\" he told BBC, so he opted to stay on campus. \nFor a group of international students gathered on the banks of the Charles River, as rowing teams sculled by, the relief was palpable when news came in of the reprieve from the Boston court.\nMr Battula also felt relieved after Judge Burroughs issued her order. But the uncertainty still is taking a toll. \n\"It's surreal to think that even for some period of time you're unlawfully staying in a country, just because you've been to university there,\" Mr Battula said.\nThere are around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolled students this year.\nAround a fifth of them are from China, with significant numbers from Canada, India, South Korea and the UK. Among the international students currently enrolled is the future queen of Belgium, 23-year-old Princess Elisabeth. \nLeo Ackerman was set to study education and entrepreneurship at Harvard beginning in August, fulfilling a \"dream\".\n\"I was really excited, and I'm still really excited if I manage to go there,\" Mr Ackerman said. \"Having it taken away feels like a really sad moment for a lot of people.\"\nEliminating foreign students would take a large bite out of Harvard's finances. Experts say international students are more likely to pay full tuition, essentially subsidising aid for American students. \nUndergraduate tuition - not including fees, housing, books, food or health insurance - will reach $59,320 (\u00a343,850) in the coming academic year, according to the university. The total cost of a year at Harvard before any financial aid is usually significantly more than $100,000.\nIsaac Bangura, a public administration student from Sierra Leone, moved to  Harvard with his wife and two young daughters after surviving a civil war.\n\"Since yesterday, my kids has been asking, 'Daddy, I understand they are coming to return us home again.' They are referring to deportation,\" he said.\nHe said he has to be strong for them and has faith. \"I know the American people are always, whenever they are into issues, they will find ways of resolving it,\" he said.\nIn addition to Harvard, the Trump administration has taken aim at other elite institutions, not only arguing that they should do more to clamp down on pro-Palestinian activists but also claiming they discriminate against conservative viewpoints.\nOn Friday, speaking from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said, \"Harvard is going to have to change its ways\" and suggested he is considering measures against more universities. \nIn April, the White House froze $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) in federal funding to Harvard, and Trump has threatened to remove the university's tax-exempt status, a standard designation for US educational institutions. \nThe funding freeze prompted an earlier Harvard lawsuit, also asking the courts to stop the administration's actions.\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said federal courts in Massachusetts and New England, where the initial stages of the case will play out, have consistently ruled against the Trump administration. \nBut the outcome may be less predictable in the US Supreme Court, where Harvard's case may end up. \n\"These are tough issues for Harvard, but they have the resources and they seem to have the will to fight,\" Mr Tobias said. \nHarvard leaders have made concessions to the White House - including dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who came under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives. \nBut it also enlisted several high-profile Republican lawyers, including Robert Hur, a former special counsel who investigated Joe Biden's retention of classified documents.\nForeign students currently attending Harvard have expressed worries that the row  could force them to transfer to another university or return home. Being logged on the SEVP system is a requirement for student visas and, if Harvard is blocked from the database, students could be found in violation and potentially face deportation. \nSeveral British students enrolled at Harvard, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity out of fear of immigration authorities, worried their US education could be cut short. \n\"I definitely think freedom of speech is a problem on campus, but it's being actively worked on... it was an absolute shock when yesterday's announcement happened,\" said one student\n\"There's a lot of anger, people feeling like we're being used as pawns in a game.\" \nWith reporting from Kayla Epstein in New York, Bernd Debusmann at the White House and the BBC's User Generated Content team\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. \nBut why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?\nKashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.\nEven before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.\nUnder the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.\nThe maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.\nA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.\nIn July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.\nA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.\nBy that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.\nWithin Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.\nReligion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.\nAn armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.\nIn 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.\nFor several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nTensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.\nIndia responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.\nKashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.\nIndia and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.\nIn 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.\nNawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.\nBut a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017.\nSince then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours.",

Four key questionsLIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killingsHow old is this conflict?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.Kashmir profile - TimelineA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.What about hopes for peace?India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.GettyPakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered KashmirIndian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond?",

Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. \nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.\nIt is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.\nHowever, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.\nThe UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.\nOne of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.\nThe British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.\nBut it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.\nThis agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.\nThe UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily.\n\"It opens up a small number of visas from an existing route for chefs and musicians and yoga teachers, very, very small, about 1,800.\"",

        "article_text": "What exactly happened to Flight AI171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick on Thursday afternoon will only be revealed by a detailed investigation, but the moments after take-off can be the most challenging in aviation.\nIndian investigators will be joined by experts from the US and UK in the coming days, as authorities attempt to establish what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to crash shortly after take-off just 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the runway at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.\nIt marks the first time a 787-8 Dreamliner has suffered a fatal crash since it entered commercial service in 2011. Thursday's disaster killed 241 people onboard and more on the ground. \nThe BBC has spoken to aviation experts as well as pilots based in India - some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity - who regularly fly 787-8s out of India's international airports to find out what factors might have caused the plane to slam into residential buildings in the heart of Ahmedabad just moments into its flight.\nThe 787-8 Dreamliner was flown by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and his co-pilot Clive Kundar. The two were highly experienced, with Mr Sabharwal reportedly having earned more than 22-years expertise as a commercial airline pilot and over 8,000 flying hours.\nThe plane was carrying 242 people as it taxied along the runway at Ahmedabad International Airport on Thursday afternoon. The jet took off at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT), operator Air India said.\nIndia's Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah said the plane was carrying 100 tonnes of fuel - practically a full load - as it climbed out of Ahmedabad.\nAlmost immediately after take-off the cockpit gave a mayday call, India's aviation regulator said. No response was given by the aircraft after that. It's unclear what prompted the mayday call, but the flight's sole survivor has told Indian media that he heard a loud bang as the plane struggled to gain altitude.\nFootage authenticated by BBC Verify then showed the plane flying low over what appears to be a residential neighbourhood. The final transmitted data showed the plane reached a height of 625ft (190m). It proceeds to descend and becomes obscured by trees and buildings, before a large explosion appears on the horizon.\n\"There would have been no time for him to react if he lost both engines,\" one pilot said. CCTV footage viewed by BBC Verify showed that the plane was airborne for 30 seconds.\nThe plane crashed in a residential area, with images showing housing blocks heavily damaged in a densely built area which included hospitals and official buildings.\nIt is almost impossible to definitively establish what caused the disaster based on videos of the plane's brief flight.\nIn the coming days a complex investigation involving the plane's black box - which records flight data - and an examination of debris will commence. But videos that have emerged show the plane struggling to lift off the ground, seemingly amid a lack of thrust or power.\nOne cause that has been speculated on by some experts is the possibility of an extremely rare double engine failure. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.\n\nDouble engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.\nOne senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging. Aircraft engines rely on a precise fuel metering system - if that system gets blocked, it can lead to fuel starvation and engine shutdown.\nMarco Chan, an ex-pilot, told BBC Verify that there isn't any evidence to suggest a double engine failure based on the available footage.\nMohan Ranganathan, an aviation expert, told the BBC that a double engine failure would be \"a very, very rare incident\".\nEngine manufacturer GE Aerospace said it was sending a team to India to help with the investigation, while Boeing said it was offering its full support to the airline.\nAnother possibility raised by some experts in India is a bird strike.\nThey occur when a plane collides with a bird and can be extremely dangerous for aircraft. In serious cases, engines can lose power if they suck in a bird, as happened in South Korea's Jeju Air disaster which killed 179 people last year.\nExperts and pilots familiar with Ahmedabad airport have told the BBC that it is \"notorious for birds\".\n\"They are always around,\" says Mr Ranganathan, echoing what at least three Indian pilots who have flown in and out of the airport told the BBC .\nGujarat state, where Ahmedabad is located, reported 462 bird strike incidents over five years, with most occurring at Ahmedabad airport, according to Civil Aviation Ministry data tabled in Parliament in December 2023.\nA Times of India report in September 2023 cited Airport Authority data noting 38 bird strikes in 2022\u201323 in Ahmedabad, a 35% rise over previous 12 months.\nIn the 2009 case, a flock of seagulls was ingested at 2,700ft \u2013 more than four times higher than the Air India flight. In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.\nHowever, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".\nThree experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.\nFlaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. \nIf they're not properly extended, a fully loaded jet - carrying passengers, heavy fuel for a long-haul flight, and battling hot conditions - will struggle to lift off.\nIn Ahmedabad, where temperatures neared 40\u00b0C (104F) on Thursday, the thinner air would have demanded higher flap settings and greater engine thrust, one pilot told the BBC. In such conditions, even a small configuration error can have catastrophic consequences.\nCCTV footage which emerged late on Thursday afternoon showed the plane taking off from Ahmedabad, struggling to achieve altitude, and then slowly descending before crashing.\nBut a take-off roll with retracted flaps would trigger warnings from the 787's take-off Configuration Warning System, alerting the flight crew to an unsafe configuration, according to one pilot the BBC spoke to.\nEx-pilot Mr Chan told BBC Verify that the footage that has emerged so far is too distorted to establish for sure whether the flaps were extended, but said that such an error would be \"highly unusual\".\n\"The flaps are set by pilots themselves, before take off, and there are several checklists and procedures to verify the setting,\" Mr Chan said. \"That would point to potential human error if flaps aren't set correctly.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jake Horton\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

In this case the Indian pilots had neither the altitude nor the time to manoeuvre.However, a senior pilot said that a bird hit is rarely catastrophic \"unless it affects both engines\".Could the plane's flaps have contributed?Three experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disaster may have occurred as the aircraft's flaps were not extended during take-off - though other pilots and analysts have challenged this.Flaps play a vital role during take-off, helping an aircraft generate maximum lift at lower speeds. Questions have been raised as to whether the plane had its Ram Air Turbine (RAT) deployed, an emergency back-up turbine which kicks in when main engines fail to generate power for essential systems.Live: Latest updates after plane carrying 242 people crashesVerified video shows Air India plane descending moments before impactWhat we know so far about flight AI171Watch: BBC correspondent reports from crash siteWhat this means for BoeingAt the scene: 'Everyone is running, trying to save as many lives as possible'Double engine failures are almost unheard of, with the most notable example being the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways Airbus A320 lost both engines to a bird strike moments after take-off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, but glided to safety.One senior pilot told the BBC that dual engine failure could also result from fuel contamination or clogging.

        "article_text": "Community leaders have called for people to stand united as tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following reported military strikes between the two countries.\nOn Wednesday, Indian forces launched \"Operation Sindoor\" targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in retaliation for a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed at least 26 people on 22 April. \nPakistan denies involvement, but Indian authorities allege attackers included Pakistani nationals.\nIn the west of England, the impact of the conflict is reverberating on families who are fielding anxious WhatsApp calls. Local leaders are also stepping forward to offer guidance and solidarity.\nThere is growing concern, not only for relatives overseas, but also over the risk of tensions disrupting the unity between communities in the region.\nBristol Green Party councillor Abdul Malik, who recently returned from his ancestral village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, said the escalation tension has \"caused a lot of grief\". \nAfter Wednesday's strikes in Pakistan, a gathering was held at Easton's Jamia Mosque. \n\"It's so important to give a sense of security to the elders who've lived most of their lives in the UK but still feel so connected to what happens abroad,\" said Mr Malik.\n\"This isn't a war about religion. This is a political war about borders. We must not bring hatred to our streets and our homes.\n\"Bristol has a wonderful Indian and Pakistani community. We've sat together. We've listened. This is the time to stand united - and that's what we intend to do.\"\n\"Trying to avoid any conflicts is my main concern,\" said Pankaj Pandya, one of the trustees of the Hindu Temple in Bristol. \n\"Hopefully it doesn't escalate, and it doesn't become tit-for-tat leading to an outright war between two nuclear nations.\n\"Being an Indian myself, it's a concern for not only what is happening between India and Pakistan, but just generally the issues of war throughout the world at the moment.\"\nLocal leaders in the west of England are also are urging communities not to spread misinformation online. \n\"There's a lot of fake information and false news being spread around which doesn't help the situation,\" said Atiff Ghafar, vice chair of the Swindon Pakistan Association.\n\"So, we have been telling and encouraging our communities not to share unverified news reports.\"\nPakistan says 36 people have been killed by Indian air strikes and firing. India says at least 16 people were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\n\"As someone from the Pakistani diaspora, it's quite sad to see that there's tensions between both communities and innocent lives have been lost on both sides of the border,\" said Mr Ghafar.\n\"We don't want anything to be spreading across to this part of the world as we have very good cordial and friendly relationships with our Indian diaspora community who have lived with us side by side for a good 50 to 60 years.\"\nOn 29 April, an interfaith and intercultural meeting was organised in Bristol by the International Human Rights Movement (HRM), Bristol Pakistani Forum and the Bristol Multi-Faith forum.\nRana Basharat Ali Khan, chairman of the HRM, said: \"It's so horrible to witness something like this in the 21st Century.\n\"It is not something we want to witness in this age, while we are fighting for justice.\n\"We need to change our priorities - we need to focus and invest on humans rather than defence and we need to come off this war affected mentality.\"\nIndian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency which has claimed thousands of lives.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over the area.\nFollowing the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, a Hindu prayer vigil was held on 27 April at the Hindu Garden of Peace in Gloucester to remember the victims of the deadly attack.\nSpeaking to the BBC Radio Gloucestershire at the vigil, Manish Jani said: \"It is something horrific against humanity, not just against one country.\" \nHema Patel echoed those emotions: \"Many people were killed, including Christians and Muslims. This is not about condemning any religion; we just pray for peace.\" \nDr Ashok and Dr Pravin Patel, co-chairs of the Hindu Cultural Association, both emphasised unity and empathy over division. \n\"The first religion is humanity,\" said Dr Pravin. \"Any heinous act by one human on another is a blot on humanity.\"\nThe Indian government says its forces have launched \"Operation Sindoor\", \"hitting terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir \"from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed\".\nIn a statement, the Indian government said that \"nine sites have been targeted\".\n\"Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution.\"\nThe statement adds that the attack was ordered after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "At a time when women's participation in the film industry was frowned upon, a young woman dared to dream differently.\nIn 1920s pre-independence India, PK Rosy became the first female lead in Malayalam-language cinema, in what is now the southern state of Kerala.\nShe starred in a movie called Vigathakumaran, or The Lost Child, in the 1920s. But instead of being remembered as a pioneer, her story was buried - erased by caste discrimination and social backlash. \nRosy belonged to a lower-caste community and faced intense criticism for portraying an upper-caste woman in Vigathakumaran. \nAlmost a hundred years later, there is no surviving evidence of Rosy's role. The film's reel was destroyed and the cast and crew have all died. \nOnly a few pictures of the film from a contested press release dated October 1930 survive, along with an unverified black-and-white photo popularised by local newspapers as Rosy's only portrait.\nEven a Google Doodle celebrating her 120th birthday used an illustration similar to the woman in the photograph. But Rosy's nephew and others who have researched her life told the BBC that they could not conclusively say that it is her in the picture.  \nPK Rosy was born as Rajamma in the early 1900s in the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, now Kerala.\nShe belonged to a family of grass cutters from the Pulaya community, part of the Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's harsh caste hierarchy and have been historically oppressed.\n\"People from the Pulaya community were considered slave labour and auctioned off with land,\" says Malavika Binny, a professor of history at Kannur University. \n\"They were considered the 'lowliest'. They were flogged, raped, tied to trees and set on fire for any so-called transgressions,\" she adds. \nDespite the dire social challenges, Rosy chose to dream differently. \nShe was supported by her uncle, who was a theatre artist himself, and with his help Rosy entered the field of entertainment. \n\"There are few available facts about Rosy's life, but it is known that she was popular for her performances in local plays,\" says Vinu Abraham, the author of The Lost Heroine, a novel based on Rosy's life.\nWhile her acting skills earned admiration, it was rare for a Dalit woman to take up acting at the time.\n\"She was likely aware of the fact that this was a new arena and making herself visible was important,\" says Prof Binny.\nShe soon became a well-known figure in local theatre circles and her talent caught the eye of director JC Daniel, who was then searching for a lead actor for his film - a character named Sarojini. \nDaniel was aware of Rosy's caste identity and chose to cast her in the role. \n\"She was paid five rupees a day for 10 days of filming,\" said Mr Abraham. \"This was a substantial amount of money in the 1920s.\"\nOn the day of the film's premiere, Rosy and her family were barred from attending the screening.\nThey were stopped because they were Dalits, Rosy's nephew Biju Govindan says. \nAnd so began a chain of events that pushed Rosy out of the public eye and her home.\n\"The crowd that came to watch the movie were provoked by two things: Rosy playing an upper-caste woman and the hero picking a flower from her hair and kissing it in one scene,\" said Mr Abraham.\n\"They started throwing rocks at the screen and chased Daniel away,\" he added.\nThere are differing accounts of the extent of the damage to the theatre but what is clear is the toll the incident took on both Rosy and Daniel.\nDaniel had spent a lot of money to establish a studio and gather resources to produce the film, and was heavily debt-ridden. Facing immense social and financial pressure, the director, who is now widely regarded as the father of Malayalam cinema, never made another film. \nRosy fled her hometown after an angry mob set her house on fire.\nShe cut all ties with her family to avoid being recognised and never spoke publicly about her past. She rebuilt her life by marrying an upper-caste man and took the name Rajammal.\nShe lived the rest of her life in obscurity in the town of Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, Mr Abraham says.  \nHer children refused to accept that PK Rosy, the Dalit actor, was their mother, Rosy's nephew Mr Govindan says. \n\"Her children were born with an upper-caste Kesavan Pillai's identity. They chose their father's seed over their mother's womb,\" he says. \n\"We, her family, are part of PK Rosy's Dalit identity before the film's release,\" he said.\n\"In the space they inhabit, caste restricts them from accepting their Dalit heritage. That is their reality and our family has no place in it.\" \nIn 2013, a Malayalam TV channel tracked down Rosy's daughter Padma, who was living in financial strain somewhere in Tamil Nadu. She told them that she did not know much about her mother's life before her marriage but that she did not act after that. \nThe BBC made attempts to contact Rosy's children, but their relatives said they were not comfortable with the attention.\nProf Binny says that the erasure of Rosy's legacy shows how deeply caste-based trauma can run.\n\"It can be so intense that it shapes or defines the rest of one's life,\" she says, adding that she is glad Rosy eventually found a safe space.\nIn recent years, Dalit filmmakers and activists have sought to reclaim Rosy's legacy. Influential Tamil director Pa Ranjith has launched a yearly film festival in her name which celebrates Dalit cinema. A film society and foundation have also been established. \nBut there is still a haunting sense that while Rosy was ultimately saved, it was at the cost of her passion and identity.\n\"Rosy prioritised survival over art and, as a result, never tried to speak publicly or reclaim her lost identity. That's not her failure - it's society's,\" says Mr Govindan.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nSharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.\nPakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nPakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.\nLate on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.\nBut Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nOn 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments.",

India has yet to respond to these claims.Late on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".Where did India hit?Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.It said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.Why is Kashmir a flashpoint between India and Pakistan?Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.The countries have fought two wars over it.But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink.",

        "article_text": "Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India Company gradually transformed into a colonial power. \nBy the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, Company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling.\nA Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by DAG, an art gallery in Delhi, features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of Company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists.\nPainted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs.\n\"The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes,\" says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show.\n\"Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them,  and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met \u2013 or at least observed \u2013 multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but \u2013 as they began to discern \u2013 were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice.\"\nBeyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. \nBefore photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists.\nBeyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb.\nThe once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. \nFrom June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)\nThe largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). \nWhile Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it.\nOriginally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801.\n\"The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century,\" writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. \n\"These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected.\"\nAnother painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. \nAt the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. \nLabeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.\nBy the late 18th Century, Company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. \nArt historian Mildred Archer called them a \"fascinating record of Indian social life,\" blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. \nRegional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers.\n\"They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life,\" says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.\nMost studies of Company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. \nA striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800.\nOne painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue.\nAmong the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting  boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats.\nWith no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.\nCompany paintings often featured natural history studies, portraying birds, animals, and plants - especially from private menageries. \nAs seen in the DAG show, these subjects are typically shown life-size against plain white backgrounds, with minimal surroundings - just the occasional patch of grass. The focus remains firmly on the species itself.\nAshish Anand, CEO of DAG, says the the latest show proposes Company paintings as the \"starting point of Indian modernism\".\nAnand says this \"was the moment when Indian artists who had trained in courtly ateliers first moved outside the court (and the temple) to work for new patrons\". \n\"The agendas of those patrons were not tied up with courtly or religious concerns; they were founded on scientific enquiry and observation,\" he says. \n\"Never mind that the patrons were foreigners. What should strike us now is how Indian artists responded to their demands, creating entirely new templates of Indian art.\"",

        "article_text": "\"Who is responsible for this mess?\"\nThe question recently echoed across India's financial capital Mumbai as thousands of residents once again found themselves stranded, soaked and frustrated.\nHeavy rains brought the city to a standstill, and this was before the monsoon had even begun in full swing. Roads turned into rivers, vehicles broke down mid-commute and low-lying neighbourhoods were waterlogged within hours. \nEven a newly-built underground metro station could not withstand the heavy downpour as photos and videos of the station flooded with muddy water went viral. \nThe pre-monsoon deluge once again exposed the city's fragile infrastructure and sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), one of India's richest civic organisations responsible for maintaining Mumbai's infrastructure, initially blamed the problem on rubbish clogging the drains and debris from metro construction, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\nFollowing criticism, the BMC installed de-watering pumps in flood-prone areas and began manually clearing waste from drains to prevent further waterlogging. But for many residents, the action came too late.\nThe crisis is neither new - nor is it unique to Mumbai.\nFrom Delhi in the north to Bengaluru in the south, India's biggest cities flood every monsoon season. Roads collapse, drains overflow, infrastructure is overwhelmed and traffic grinds to a halt.\nExperts blame rapid unplanned urbanisation, poor infrastructure and years of environmental neglect as the root causes of this problem. \n\"The pace of urban expansion has far exceeded the evolution of supporting infrastructure, particularly in water and drainage systems,\" says Dikshu Kukreja, an architect and urban planner based in Delhi.\n\"Many cities rely on outdated systems designed decades ago. And in the process of unchecked expansion, natural drainage channels, wetlands and water bodies that once absorbed excess rainwater have been built over or neglected,\" he adds.\nExperts say there's no one-size-fits-all solution as each city faces unique challenges and factors such as geography, population and climate must be considered when designing effective responses.\nIndia receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September.\nThe monsoon is crucial for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of Indian farmers. They rely on seasonal showers in parts of the country where proper irrigation channels are absent.\nBut experts say climate change has made erratic weather - such as unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat - a more regular phenomenon, directly affecting millions of people.\nThis year the monsoon arrived a week early in parts of southern India, catching authorities unprepared. \n\"A depression developed over the eastern central Arabian Sea which was instrumental in pulling up the monsoon current,\" says Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet. \nIn Delhi, the Minto bridge has become a symbol of the city's annual monsoon chaos. Almost every year, after heavy rain, a bus or lorry gets stuck under the bridge - an image that highlights the city's struggle with urban flooding.\nThis year, Delhi recorded its wettest May since 1901, with more than 185mm of rainfall, according to the Indian weather department. \nMany residents reported damage to their property. \nAt least four people were killed and dozens more were injured in one of the two heavy storms that hit the city in May, according to media reports.\nMeanwhile, in Bengaluru, more than 2,000kms (1,240 miles) from the capital, the problem looks different but its root cause is the same. \nOnce known for its network of lakes that helped manage excess rainwater, Bengaluru has seen many of these water bodies encroached upon. In their place now stand apartment complexes, business hubs and roads - leaving the city vulnerable to flooding.\n\"Bengaluru is made up of three major valleys through which water naturally flows. Most of the city's lakes are located in these valleys,\" explains Ram Prasad, a lake conservation activist.\nThese valleys were originally designated as no-construction zones but over the years, encroachment has taken place and later changes in the law permitted infrastructure projects to be built in the area, he says. \n\"When you convert lakes - which traditionally act as flood buffers - into built-up areas, the water has nowhere to go. So, what we're seeing in Bengaluru today is the result of poor urban planning.\" \nMr Prasad points out that Bengaluru, which sits atop a hill, was never meant to flood and the current situation is entirely man-made.\nViolations of building norms, especially construction that narrows stormwater drains or builds directly over them, have only made things worse, he says.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai faces natural challenges due to its geography. For example, many parts of Mumbai are low-lying and close to the sea, which makes them more vulnerable to flooding during heavy rains and high tides.\nBut experts say it's human actions that have made things much worse: cutting down mangroves, which normally act like natural barriers against floods, and building on floodplains where water is supposed to drain.\n\"The breakdown is systemic - it begins with planning that often doesn't account for future climate variabilities, gets exacerbated by poor execution and is compounded by weak enforcement of regulations,\" Mr Kukerja says. \"Political will is often reactive - responding to disasters rather than investing in long-term resilience.\"\nThis isn't just a big city problem. Smaller towns often suffer equally, if not more. \nOver the weekend, at least 30 people died in India's northeastern states after heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides. Tens of thousands have been affected, with rescue efforts under way. \nSo, can anything be done to prevent this?\n\"Yes,\" says Mr Kukreja, but only if it is part of a long-term, co-ordinated strategy.\nHe suggests using mapping and real-time sensors to identify high-risk zones and alert communities. Predictive models can also help authorities plan better responses.\n\"But technology alone is not a fix, it needs to be paired with responsive governance and community involvement,\" he said.\nFor India's cities to withstand the rains, they need more than just de-watering pumps and quick fixes. They need forward-thinking planning, before the damage is done.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Nearly two dozen paintings by one of the world's most celebrated modern artists - once part of a record-breaking art deal - are set to hit the auction block for the first time next week.\nOn 12 June, 25 rare MF Husain paintings will go under the hammer at an art gallery in Mumbai city, more than two decades after he painted them. \nThis will be the first public glimpse of the paintings, locked away in bank vaults since 2008 after authorities seized them from a prominent businessman over an alleged loan default.\n\"It's like the paintings have come full circle,\" says Dadiba Pundole, director of Pundole Art Gallery, where the auction is set to be held.\nHusain used the gallery as his studio for many of these works, part of an ambitious 100-painting series he never finished. Often called the \"Picasso of India,\" he was one of the country's most celebrated - and controversial - artists. His works have fetched millions, but his bold themes often drew criticism. He died in 2011, aged 95.\nTitled MF Husain: An Artist's Vision of the XX Century, the 25 paintings at Pundole'a gallery offer a glimpse into his take on a transformative century shaped by leaps in technology, politics, and culture. Pundole has estimated that the auction could fetch up to $29m (\u00a321m).\nThis comes months after another Husain painting, Untitled (Gram Yatra), sold for an unprecedented $13.8m at a Christie's auction in New York, becoming the most expensive Indian artwork to be auctioned.\nThe oil-on-canvas masterpiece had adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital for almost five decades, forgotten by the art world, until the auction house was alerted about its presence in 2013.\nThe latest paintings to be auctioned seem to follow a similar trajectory.\nHusain began working on them in the early 2000s, with great excitement and vigour, recalls Pundole.\n\"When he was painting, nothing could disturb him. It didn't matter what was happening around him,\" he adds.\nIn 2004, Husain sold 25 paintings to a Mumbai businessman as the first instalment of a billion-rupee deal.\nKishore Singh, author of MF Husain: The Journey of a Legend, wrote about this agreement in the Indian Express newspaper.\n\"He [Husain] wasn't jealous of fellow artists, but he was competitive,\" Singh writes, noting that Husain struck the deal soon after Tyeb Mehta's Kali [an Indian goddess] set a new record for India's most expensive painting in 2002, selling for 15 million rupees.\nHusain struck a billion rupees deal with businessman Guru Swarup Srivastava for this series of paintings. Media dubbed it \"India's biggest art deal,\" catapulting the little-known Srivastava into overnight fame as a celebrity collector.\nBut two years later, India's top crime agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), began investigating Srivastava's business, alleging he and associates had misused a loan from a government-backed agricultural body.\nThe CBI alleged Srivastava diverted the funds into real estate, mutual funds, and  Husain paintings. He and his company deny all charges; the case remains in court.\nIn 2008, a tribunal allowed the government-backed agricultural body to seize one billion rupees in assets from Srivastava, including the 25 Husain paintings.\nIn February this year, a court cleared the way for the paintings to be auctioned to recover part of the loan. And so, after years locked away in bank vaults, the 25 paintings are finally stepping into the spotlight.\nIn a 2018 interview to author and journalist Tara Kaushal, Srivastava spoke about his stalled deal with the artist.\n\"I had planned to pay Husain for the rest of the paintings by selling the first 25. But legal complications meant that, when Husain called me in 2008 saying the paintings were ready in London and Paris, and to pick them up at the agreed price, my funds were not ready. He understood,\" he said.\nAsked why Husain had chosen to sell his paintings to a person who almost nobody knew in India's elite art circles, Pundole says, \"He didn't care. As long as his paintings were sold.\"\nThere's no way to know how Husain felt about the failed deal or his unfinished 20th Century series - but the episode remains a striking footnote in his bold, eventful career. \nThe 25 paintings in this series, vibrant acrylics on canvas, showcase Husain's bold style while reflecting key 20th-century events and social attitudes. \nOne painting shows an unlikely group chatting on a bench, symbolising Husain's call for peaceful dialogue and coexistence among global powers.\nAnother painting honours Charlie Chaplin while juxtaposing a rocket launch to highlight the contrast between social and economic disparities and massive state spending.\nOther paintings depict a world battling poverty, soldiers in trenches, and humanity confronting tragedies like World War Two, the Partition, and the Holocaust.

        "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.\nThe recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\n\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\n\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.\nIndia and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. \nThe LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. \nCeasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)\nThe LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". \nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. \nNot surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\n\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.\nViolence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.\nThe 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.\nBetween 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \n\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.\nTensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\n\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.\nMr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\n\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.\nMr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.\nHe argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \nThe hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.\nSome experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\n\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"\nIn his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \n\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.\nToday, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\n\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.\nIt was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",

        "article_text": "The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.\nOn Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.\nPakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.\nAs Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.\n\"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.\nSince Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.\nPakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.  \nLaser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement. \nDrones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek.\nExperts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.\nThe Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft). \nWhile many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities. \nIndia is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.\nPakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.\nHe said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities. \nMr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.\nProf Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\".\nWhile the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.\n\"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.\nEjaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\". \n\"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.\n\nWhile drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.\n\"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi.\n\"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\"\nClearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.\n\"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek.\n\"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\" ",

        "article_text": "Robots for training carers, sensors that monitor people as they sleep and an app that can detect if someone is in pain - could this be the future of care?\nThe care sector is increasingly using technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to look after the UK's ever-growing elderly population.\nDespite this, experts have urged people to consider the potential risks of an overreliance on AI in the industry.\n\"AI can only be part of the solution but not the whole solution,\" says Dr Caroline Green from the University of Oxford.\nMs Green, the director of research at the Institute for Ethics in AI, spoke at an AI in Social Care Summit at the university in March.\nShe highlighted how AI systems could be susceptible to biases, which amplify discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping and has also recognised the worries people have around sharing their personal data with the technology.\n\"At the moment there's no official government policy on guidance on the use of AI in social care,\" Ms Green added.\nShe said: \"Whether it's going to be good for people who need support, depends on how policy is going to shape up here, it depends on what choices people will continue to have in the future, or whether they can for example opt out of having AI in their care at all, it will depend on whether there is going to be a sense in which AI technology can take over care provision and human interaction. \n\"We need to be very careful here on what choices people will have in the future and what the future of social care with AI will look like.\"\nThomas Tredinnick is the boss of AllyCares that uses sensors to monitor care home residents' rooms overnight, listening out for anything out of the ordinary.\nIt sends an audio recording of any incidents to carers on shift, who can then decide how to act.\nSpeaking from Oaklands Rest Home in Southampton, which uses the technology, Mr Tredinnick said it saves staff having to perform regular nightly checks, meaning residents can get a better sleep.\n\"The care staff are providing care to the residents that need it,\" he said.\nHe claims it has helped to reduce preventable health events leading to hospital admissions, as it spots things like falls and chest infections before they escalate.\nChristine Herbert said her 99-year-old mother Betty is one of the residents being monitored by the technology.\nShe admitted she was uncertain about the use of AI at first, comparing the technology to a \"baby monitor\".\n\"When mum came here for the first few nights I did ask for routine checks because I was concerned,\" she said.\nMrs Herbert said she came around to the technology after the home presented her with data which showed how her mother was monitored and not disturbed during the night.\nAt Elmbrook Court care home in Wantage, Oxfordshire, they are using AI to find out if residents are in pain.\nAislinn Mullee, deputy manager at the home, said: \"It can be quite difficult to identify pain in a resident that is non-verbal.\"\nUsing a smartphone app called Painchek, carers scan a resident's face for pain indicators, answer questions about the resident and then receive an instant percentage score which indicates the level of pain that person is feeling.\nMs Mullee said it has made a \"huge difference\" and they have used the information in collaboration with local GPs to assess which pain medication a resident requires.\nShe added it has also been used to reassure family members that a loved one receiving end-of-life care was not in pain.\nMs Mullee made clear the data gathered was password-protected and only visible to staff at the home.\nAt the University of Oxford's Robotics Institute they are hoping AI could also be used to train carers.\nMarco Pontin, a Post Doctoral Research Assistant, is part of a team which has created a robot which reacts to human touch.\nIt can be programmed to feel pain in different parts of its body and will physically flinch if a carer is too forceful when touching a painful area.\nIt will be trialled with students studying to be occupational therapists at Oxford Brookes University.\nMr Pontin said the team hoped to use it as a \"digital twin\" of real life patients.\nIt will be programmed with the same conditions as a human patient so that carers \"can replicate whatever they have seen in the real world but with the robot counterpart\".\nHe said: \"With an ever-growing ageing population it's harder to be there for everyone, so providing a digital twin of a patient could enable occupational therapists to know what is going on with their various patients without necessarily being there all of the time.\" \nPeople are living longer and there are an estimated 12 million people in the UK aged 67 or over, with that figure projected to rise to 13.7m by 2032.\nA report published by the House of Commons library in March stated in 2023/24, local authorities in England spent \u00a323.3bn on adult social care, which was the second biggest area of council spending after education.\nThe sector's reliance on workers from overseas is another big issue.\nHome Office statistics showed 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care, in the 12 months to December 2024.\nThis was a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules.\n\"We're reliant on migrant workers to keep social care going at the moment,\" says Lee-Ann Fenge, professor of social care at Bournemouth University.\nShe said she does not believe new technology should be used as a way of filling the gaps in the sector.\nShe said \"It needs to be seen as a tool that enhances the work that is already happening.\"\nShe added time needed to be taken to \"think about some of the ethical challenges\" that monitoring people could have.\n\"We need to prepare people better to protect themselves, so this isn't just about saying AI is wonderful, let's use it. We need to look at both the potentials of AI but also the risks that it could pose,\" she said.\nIn February, the UK and US governments refused to sign an international AI declaration in Paris, which pledged an \"open\", \"inclusive\" and \"ethical\" approach to the technology's development.\nThis comes as the government announced in March it will take a \"test and learn\" approach to funding AI in the public sector, in order to \"push innovation\".\nWhen catching up with Dr Caroline Green again she continues to promote a cautious approach to AI.\n\"It can help with some of the administrative work, some of the operation of care, but it cannot replace that human touch,\" she said.\n\"There is a potential risk that AI is going to be seen as a panacea to some of those very big problems that we are seeing in social care provision, namely that we don't have enough staff, and that there is a growing demand from an ageing population.\n\"I think here we really need to make sure that we don't just invest in AI to take over care-giving but that we keep on investing in people, in professionals who will be able to provide that care.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \"We will harness cutting-edge technology to transform social care and we are already seeing promising developments across the sector - from AI-powered fall detection systems that provide earlier interventions, to tools which automate paperwork to free up staff to focus on caring for people.\n\"Making better use of AI in social care is exactly the kind of transformation we're championing in our 10 Year Health Plan \u2013 shifting from treating sickness to preventing it, from hospital to community care, and from analogue to digital solutions.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

        "article_text": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.\nDespite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.\nIt also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. \nIn a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.\nDelhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".\nThe IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.\nEven Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\n\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.\nIndia's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".\nAs one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.\nUnlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.\nFor example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.\n\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.\nAddressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.\nIn their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.\nFurthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.\n\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. \nThe FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\n\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"\nAs things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.\nSeparately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.\nSuch reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.\nMr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.\nHe points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. \nBut why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?\nKashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.\nEven before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.\nUnder the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.\nThe maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.\nA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.\nIn July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.\nA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.\nBy that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.\nWithin Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.\nReligion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.\nAn armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.\nIn 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.\nFor several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nTensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.\nIndia responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.\nKashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.\nIndia and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.\nIn 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.\nNawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.\nBut a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017.\nSince then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours.",

Four key questionsLIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killingsHow old is this conflict?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.Kashmir profile - TimelineA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.What about hopes for peace?India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.GettyPakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered KashmirIndian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond?",

        "article_text": "A black box has been found at the site of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India's civil aviation minister said on Friday. \nThe flight data recorder was recovered within 28 hours by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu confirmed. \nAll but one of the 242 people on the London-bound flight died when it crashed into a residential area less than 60 seconds after take-off on Thursday. An official told the BBC that at least eight people on the ground were also killed.\n\"The [recovery of the black box] marks an important step forward in the investigation\" and will \"significantly aid the inquiry\" into the disaster, Mr Kinjarapu said.\nPlanes usually carry two black boxes - small but tough electronic data recorders. \nOne records flight data, such as altitude and speed. The other records sound from the cockpit, so investigators can hear what the pilots are saying and listen for any unusual noises.\nAAIB is leading the inquiry into the cause of the crash, helped by teams from the US and UK. Boeing's chief executive, Kelly Ortberg, said the company was supporting the investigation. \nAir India said there were 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft when it crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT). \nIt was scheduled to land at London's Gatwick airport at 18:25 BST.\nOn Friday, the wreckage was still scattered across the crash site, including the blackened wing of the plane, with large pieces of the aircraft stuck in buildings.\nInvestigators arrived at the scene and crowds were moved further away from the wreckage. \nA doctor told the BBC that they are relying on DNA from relatives to identify the victims. A police official at the post-mortem room told the BBC that the remains of six people had been released to families so far, as their relatives were able to identify them based on facial features.\nThe sole survivor of the crash, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, who was in seat 11A on the flight, is still recovering in hospital. \n\"I still cannot believe how I made it out alive,\" he told India's state broadcaster DD News on Thursday.\n\"At first, I thought I was going to die. I managed to open my eyes, unfastened my seat belt and tried to exit the plane.\"\nMr Ramesh, 40, who sustained burn injuries on his left hand, said he saw the aircraft crew and its passengers die in front of his eyes.\nMeanwhile, desperate families are still waiting for news of their relatives. \nImtiaz Ali, whose brother Javed and his family were on the flight, said that until he sees his brother's body, he will not believe he has died.\n\"If I get sad and start crying, then I'll be uncontrollable,\" he told the BBC. \n\"No-one will be able to stop me... my heart might burst.\" \nThe plane crashed in a residential area called Meghani Nagar and, even though it had just taken off, the impact was severe. Wreckage spread over 200m (656ft), according to responders. \nIt is still unclear exactly how many were killed on the ground, but the BBC has been told that at least eight people, who were not on the aircraft, have died. \nDr Minakshi Parikh, the dean of the BJ Medical College and Civil Hospital, said four of their students died as the plane crashed into buildings on the campus.\n\"There were also four relatives of our doctors who were on the campus when the aircraft crashed - they too were killed,\" Dr Parikh said.\n\"We are relying only on DNA matching to identify them and it is something where we simply cannot rush or afford mistakes. \n\"We are working with sincerity. We want relatives to understand, and be a bit patient. We want to hand over [the bodies] as soon as possible.\" \nOn Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent around 20 minutes at the site of the plane crash. \nHe did not speak to reporters afterwards but a video posted on his YouTube channel showed him walking around the site and inspecting the debris.\nModi also visited the location of a now-viral image that shows the tail of the crashed plane lodged in a building. \nEarlier on Friday, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson also went to the crash site, later describing the visit as \"deeply moving\".\nAccording to data by tracking website, Flightradar24, the Boeing Dreamliner 787-8 had completed more than 700 flights in the year leading up to the Thursday's disaster. \nThe Air India plane was 11 years old and its most common routes included flights between Mumbai and Dubai, as well as the capital New Delhi and European destinations such as Milan, Paris and Amsterdam.\nThe plane had operated 25 flights from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick in the past two years.",

        "article_text": "In 2010, Indian filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan made a striking debut at Cannes with Masaan -  a poignant tale of love, loss, and the oppressive grip of the caste system, set against the holy city of Varanasi.\nThe main lead in the film (Vicky Kaushal) performed a job assigned to one of the lowest castes in the rigid Hindu caste hierarchy \u2013 cremating dead bodies along the Ganges. Masaan played in the \"Un Certain Regard\" section at the festival, which looks at films with unusual styles and or that tells non-traditional stories. It won the FIPRESCI and the Avenir - also known as the Promising Future Prize - prizes.\nSince then, Ghaywan was in search of a story about India's marginalised communities. Five years ago in the middle of the pandemic, a friend, Somen Mishra - the head of creative development at Dharma Productions in Mumbai - recommended an opinion piece called Taking Amrit Home, published in The New York Times. It was written by the journalist Basharat Peer. \nWhat drew Ghaywan to Peer's article was that it tracked the journeys - sometimes of hundreds or even thousands of miles - taken by millions of Indians who travelled on foot to get home during the nation's strict lockdown during the pandemic. But he was also drawn to the core of the story, which focused on the childhood friendship between two men \u2013 one Muslim and the other Dalit (formerly known as the untouchables).\nGhaywan's new film Homebound, inspired by Peer's article, premiered at Cannes Film Festival's \"Un Certain Regard\" section this week, ending with a nine-minute long standing ovation. \n\nMany in the audience were seen wiping away tears. Ghaywan gave the lead producer Karan Johar a tight hug, while he and his young lead actors \u2013 Ishan Khatter, Vishal Jethwa and Janhvi Kapoor - came together in a larger group hug later. \nSince this was the biggest South Asian event at Cannes 2025, other film luminaries showed up to support the screening. India's Mira Nair (who won the Camera d'Or in 1988 for Salaam Bombay) leaned across two rows of seats to reach out to Johar. Pakistan's Siam Sadiq (who won the Un Certain Regard Jury Prize in 2022 for Joyland) was seen making a reel of the mood inside the theatre that he later posted on Instagram.\nThe film also received backing from a rather unexpected quarter. Its main producer is Johar, the leading Indian commercial filmmaker (known for blockbuster films like Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham and the recent Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani). But last month Martin Scorsese stepped in as the executive producer after he was introduced to the film by the French producer M\u00e9lita Toscan du Plantier.\nThis is the first time Scorsese has stepped in to support a contemporary Indian film. Until now he has only backed restored classic Indian films. \n\"I have seen Neeraj's first film Masaan in 2015 and I loved it, so when M\u00e9lita Toscan du Plantier sent me the project of his second film, I was curious,\" Scorsese said in a statement last month. \n\"I loved the story, the culture and was willing to help. Neeraj has made a beautifully crafted film that's a significant contribution to Indian cinema.\"\nAccording to Ghaywan, Scorsese helped nurture the film by mentoring the team through a number of rounds of edits. But he also tried to understand the cultural context which helped the exchange of ideas.\nThe context was important to Ghaywan, since he had been trying to capture the right spirit of the subject he was tackling. \nThe film's two lead characters \u2013 Mohammed Shoaib Ali (Khatter) and Chandan Kumar (Jethwa) have shared histories \u2013 the weight of centuries of discrimination at the hand of upper caste Hindus, but also similar goals to rise above the barriers imposed on them - in this case by joining their state's police force.\nGhaywan has openly shared that he was born into a Dalit family - a reality that has cast a long shadow over his life, haunting him since childhood.  \nAs an adult, he went on to study business administration and then worked in a corporate job in Gurgaon outside the capital, Delhi. He said he never faced discrimination but was acutely aware of his position in the caste hierarchy and still lives with the weight of where he was born. \n\"I am the only acknowledged person from the community who is there behind and in the front of camera in all of Hindi cinema history. That is the kind of gap we are living with,\" he says.\nA majority of India lives in its villages, but Hindi filmmakers rarely talk about bringing the villages to their stories, says Ghaywan. What also offends him is that marginalised communities are only talked about as statistics. \n\"What if we pick one person out of that statistic and see what happened in their lives?\" he says. \"How did they get to this point? I felt it was worth narrating a story.\"\nWhen he sat down to write the script, he tried to fictionalise the backstories of the two protagonists until the point that they took the journey during Covid \u2013 which is the beginning of Peer's article.\nAs a child in Hyderabad, Ghaywan had a close Muslim friend, Asghar, so he felt deeply connected to Ali and Kumar's lived experiences in the film.\n\"What appealed to me more was the humanity behind it, the interpersonal, the interiority of the relationship,\" he says, that took him back to his childhood in Hyderabad.\nIn Ghaywan's hands, Homebound has the wonderful glow and warmth of the winter sun. It is gorgeously shot in India's rural North, capturing simple joys and the daily struggles of its Muslim and Dalit protagonists. The two men, the woman one of them loves (Kapoor and Jethwa both portray Dalit characters), and their interactions offer much to reflect on and understand.\nFor the most part, Ghaywan's script keeps viewers on the edge. Back in 2019, none of us truly grasped the scale of the coming pandemic - but the film subtly foreshadows a shift, reminding us that a crisis can cut across class, caste, and ethnicity, touching everyone.\nHomebound's seamless blend of fiction and reality has produced a powerful public document, grounding its characters in authenticity. More than just moving its audience to tears, the film is bound to spark meaningful conversations - and, one hopes, a deeper understanding of those who live in the shadows. ",

        "article_text": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.\nYet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.\nEven scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. \nSix years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. \nAs the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.\nPresident Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\n\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.\nIndia and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.\nThe bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \n\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.\nOne reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.\nSince testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. \nIndia, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.\nFurther ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.\nIn 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.\nIn his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.\nAround the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. \nFormer Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \n\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.\nBut nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.\nIn March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)\nYet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \n\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \n\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\n\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.\nAt the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. \nWith new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  \nAnd as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.\nDespite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.\nYet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\n\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\n\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\"",

He deserves to be recognised for this and I'm sure he will have a bright future in the game.\"\nThe Hornets are now looking for their 10th permanent head coach since Nigel Pearson was sacked in the summer of 2020 with the club facing relegation from the Premier League.\nCleverley was the first head coach to remain in charge for an entire season since Javi Gracia in 2018-19.\nHe was unbeaten at home in his first 15 league games as boss, but results took a downturn following a 2-1 defeat by Cardiff on 29 December and they only took five points from the next nine matches.\nReports in Spain earlier this season claimed former Villarreal head coach Jose Rojo Martin, known as Pacheta, had been in talks with Watford to replace him.\nIn January, the club dismissed that as \"pure speculation\" and owner Gino Pozzo later said of Cleverley: \"We are committed to support him and look forward to the challenges ahead together.\"\nSpeaking last week, Cleverley said that hopes of achieving a play-off place had been undermined by injuries, particularly among his forwards.\n\"There's no difference in the number of goals we've conceded from pre-January to post-January, but the amount of goals we've scored has dropped significantly,\" he said.\nHe promised to learn the lessons of the campaign and added: \"We spent 10 weeks in the play-offs [places], we showed real positive signs before the turn of the year and I think we can clearly identify where and why we've run out of a bit of steam.\n\"We've got an incredibly young squad, the average age is boosted up by one or two individuals, but apart from that it's largely under 25 and the majority under 21 at the minute.\n\"The experiences they will have had this year - some bad ones - to really develop and ultimately improve from is one of the really exciting positives from this season.\"\nNo Watford manager or head coach has lasted an entire calendar year in the job since Malky Mackay in 2010.\nSince being relegated from the Premier League in 2022, they have finished 11th, 15th and now 14th.\n\"There will be no further club comment until a new appointment has been made,\" a statement on the Hornets website said.\nTom Cleverley made 146 appearances for Watford as a player\nBy Geoff Doyle, BBC Three Counties Radio sport editor\nThis is going to go down very badly with Watford fans. Tom Cleverley was a really popular head coach \u2013 probably the most popular since Javi Gracia who took the club to a Wembley FA Cup final - and supporters will be upset and angry. \nCleverley was a former player who first joined the club when he was a youngster on loan from Manchester United and then came back towards the end of his career. He then became academy manager at the club before his role as first-team head coach. \nWatford were seen as possible relegation candidates this season but Cleverley had them in and around the play-offs all season before they drifted away. \nHe also had to go through a seriously awkward situation in January where his club had to reassure him he wasn't being sacked on the day of a game when reports in Spain suggested the club had a new man lined up. \nThe Watford board feel like it's the right time for change and can point to a poor run of form in the last four months. But Watford fans' favourite song this season has been about not caring about owner Gino Pozzo and only caring about Cleverley. \nThis news isn't going to help relations between the owner and supporters.",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

        "article_text": "The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desk calls to break into organisations.\nHackers have targeted Marks & Spencer, Co-op and Harrods in the last two weeks, and on Friday the anonymous group told the BBC there will be more attacks soon.\nNow the NCSC, the government agency responsible for cyber security, has issued guidance to organisations urging them to review their IT help desk \"password reset processes\" to reduce their chances of getting hacked.\n\"We believe by following best practice, all companies and organisations can minimise the chances of falling victim to actors like this,\" it said.\nIt said firms should reassess how their IT help desk \"authenticates staff members\" before resetting passwords, especially senior employees with access to high-level parts of an IT network.\nIt highlighted press speculation around \"social engineering\" as a way hackers may have gained access to accounts.\nCriminals use social engineering techniques to get people to trust them when they email, text or call pretending to be from a company's IT help desk - ultimately tricking employees into handing over their log in passwords and security codes.\nThis also works the other way - calling people who work on the help desk and pretending to be an employee locked out of their account.\nCyber security experts now recommend further layers of security to deal with these sorts of attacks.\n\"Having code words that get used when an employee phones up to change their credentials, such as \"BluePenguin\", is one thing being discussed in the cyber community as a way to check that the member of staff is genuine,\" said Lisa Forte from cyber security firm Red Goat.\n\"Ultimately it comes back to the same issue with login credentials as always \u2013 we need multiple ways to do it to ensure it isn't easy to bypass.\"\nThe NCSC advice is the strongest hint yet the hackers are using tactics most commonly associated with a collective of English-speaking cyber criminals nicknamed Scattered Spider.\nThe name derives from \"spider\" being the label given to financially motivated cyber criminals, while \"scattered\" is because they are not a cohesive, organised gang.\nIn the past two years these disparate hackers, in their teens or early twenties, have coordinated and planned attacks on Discord and Telegram to breach dozens of companies and steal or scramble data to extort their victims.\nThe NCSC does not specifically name the group as being responsible for the current wave of attacks, but acknowledges Scattered Spider are known for these types of hacks.\nIn other NCSC advice, cyber defenders are being urged to watch out for \"Risky Logins\".\nThis means looking out for when and where employees have logged in from - for example late at night or from strange locations.\nAlthough cyber criminals could be anywhere in the world, young English-speaking hackers in the UK and US have become adept at using social engineering in their attacks.\nScattered Spider hackers have been responsible for high profile attacks including the coordinated moves against casinos in Las Vegas in which MGM Grand Casinos and Caesar's Palace were hit in quick succession.\nThere have been six arrests in the last year of hackers accused of being from Scattered Spider in the US and UK.\nIn July 2024 a 17-year-old from Walsall was arrested as part of an FBI investigation into the MGM hack - and months later a person of the same age and location was arrested in connection with another hack on Transport for London. \nPolice would not say if the alleged hacker was the same person.\nOn Friday, the hackers responsible for the current wave of attacks spoke to the BBC.\nThe criminals repeatedly denied they are Scattered Spider hackers and would only call themselves DragonForce - the name of a cyber crime service hackers can use for malicious software and extortion.\nThe hackers, who were fluent English speakers, revealed to the BBC they had compromised Co-op and stolen a large amount of customer and employee data.\nThey would not discuss the M&S hacks.

        "summary": "Beware phony IT calls after Co-op and M&S hacks, says UK cyber centre3 hours agoShareSaveJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServiceShareSaveGetty ImagesThe National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned that criminals launching cyber attacks at British retailers are impersonating IT help desk calls to break into organisations.Hackers have targeted Marks & Spencer, Co-op and Harrods in the last two weeks, and on Friday the anonymous group told the BBC there will be more attacks soon.Now the NCSC, the government agency responsible for cyber security, has issued guidance to organisations urging them to review their IT help desk \"password reset processes\" to reduce their chances of getting hacked. \"We believe by following best practice, all companies and organisations can minimise the chances of falling victim to actors like this,\" it said.It said firms should reassess how their IT help desk \"authenticates staff members\" before resetting passwords, especially senior employees with access to high-level parts of an IT network.It highlighted press speculation around \"social engineering\" as a way hackers may have gained access to accounts.Co-op cyber attack affects customer data, firm admits, after hackers contact BBCCriminals use social engineering techniques to get people to trust them when they email, text or call pretending to be from a company's IT help desk - ultimately tricking employees into handing over their log in passwords and security codes.This also works the other way - calling people who work on the help desk and pretending to be an employee locked out of their account.Cyber security experts now recommend further layers of security to deal with these sorts of attacks. \"NCSC adviceThe NCSC advice is the strongest hint yet the hackers are using tactics most commonly associated with a collective of English-speaking cyber criminals nicknamed Scattered Spider.The name derives from \"spider\" being the label given to financially motivated cyber criminals, while \"scattered\" is because they are not a cohesive, organised gang.In the past two years these disparate hackers, in their teens or early twenties, have coordinated and planned attacks on Discord and Telegram to breach dozens of companies and steal or scramble data to extort their victims.The NCSC does not specifically name the group as being responsible for the current wave of attacks, but acknowledges Scattered Spider are known for these types of hacks.In other NCSC advice, cyber defenders are being urged to watch out for \"Risky Logins\".This means looking out for when and where employees have logged in from - for example late at night or from strange locations.Although cyber criminals could be anywhere in the world, young English-speaking hackers in the UK and US have become adept at using social engineering in their attacks.Scattered Spider hacksScattered Spider hackers have been responsible for high profile attacks including the coordinated moves against casinos in Las Vegas in which MGM Grand Casinos and Caesar's Palace were hit in quick succession.There have been six arrests in the last year of hackers accused of being from Scattered Spider in the US and UK.In July 2024 a 17-year-old from Walsall was arrested as part of an FBI investigation into the MGM hack - and months later a person of the same age and location was arrested in connection with another hack on Transport for London. \"Having code words that get used when an employee phones up to change their credentials, such as \"BluePenguin\", is one thing being discussed in the cyber community as a way to check that the member of staff is genuine,\" said Lisa Forte from cyber security firm Red Goat. Police would not say if the alleged hacker was the same person.On Friday, the hackers responsible for the current wave of attacks spoke to the BBC.The criminals repeatedly denied they are Scattered Spider hackers and would only call themselves DragonForce - the name of a cyber crime service hackers can use for malicious software and extortion.The hackers, who were fluent English speakers, revealed to the BBC they had compromised Co-op and stolen a large amount of customer and employee data.They would not discuss the M&S hacks.",

The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.\nIn July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.\nA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.\nBy that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.\nWithin Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.\nReligion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.\nAn armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.\nIn 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.\nFor several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nTensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.\nIndia responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.\nKashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.\nIndia and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.\nIn 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.\nNawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.\nBut a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab.

I had a clear vision for my life.\"\nBujumbura, located on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, is the commercial capital of a nation which is one of the world's poorest in terms of GDP per capita, according to the World Bank.\nBorn in the Buyenzi area of the city, Ndayishimiye is the eldest of three siblings and has another five half-siblings. His family later moved to the \"dumpsite neighbourhood\" of Buterere.\nHis skills on a football pitch helped him stand out even if, on occasion, he had to train barefoot.\nWhen bigger clubs came calling, he would even have to deal with bouts of jealousy from his peers.\n\"One day I had to borrow boots from a friend when a second division club, Les Lierres, had agreed to sign me,\" he said.\n\"I was devastated when he refused to lend me the boots [for a trial], but I didn't give up.\"\nAfter a spell playing for Aigle Noir in Burundi's southern province of Makamba, Ndayishimiye got his big break in Europe in January 2020 when he joined Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor.\nJust a year later he was on the move again, sealing a switch to Istanbul Basaksehir.\nThe defender is now well settled on the Cote d'Azur as vice-captain of Nice.\nHe has two children under five, is a committed Muslim, and retains links to his homeland with his support of Burundian musicians, whom he regularly listens to at home and in his car.\nThe centre-back says his story should serve as an inspiration to others.\n\"I knew that there was no other way to help me get out of this life than through football,\" he said.\n\"You should not lose hope. Look at the homes you grew up in, look at your destitute families, then wake up early and work hard to get your families out of poverty.\n\"So, it is vital for the youth to keep hope, respect God and work hard. None of us were born with the success we've reached.\"\nNdayishimiye's message about resilience will be important over the next few months, as he could be out of action until 2026 after rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in training last week.\nNdayishimiye spent two years playing in Turkey before joining Nice\nNdayishimiye's performances in his first full Ligue 1 campaign with Nice were strong enough to see him nominated for the Prix Marc-Vivien Foe Award, an award handed to the best African footballer in France.\nBefore suffering his injury, Ndayishimiye was leading from the front in the club's bid to reach the Champions League and, while wearing the captain's armband, he netted the killer third goal against Paris St-Germain last month.\nThat header kept his side in the hunt for a place at Europe's top table and ended PSG's hopes of becoming the first team to complete an unbeaten season in the French top flight.\nWhile usually taking acclaim from the stands at the Allianz Riviera, Ndayishimiye is well aware that playing in Europe comes with its downsides.\n\"Some of my team-mates here have been racially abused,\" he said.\n\"I always tell them 'let's focus on the job that brought us here. Let's shut those jealous people up with our performances'.\n\"Frankly, racism is like a pandemic - undefeatable anytime soon.\"\nNdayishimiye is proud of being black, but feels there is little he can do to combat discrimination in the game.\n\"Even before us, Yaya Toure tried his best, Samuel Eto'o tried but they couldn't succeed,\" he said.\n\"I can't do anything about it. I have no power.\n\"If I'm abused, it won't affect me because I know why I came \u2013 just to play football.\"\nBurundi's sole appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations came at the 2019 edition, when the side lost all three group games\nEven if Ndayishimiye makes his bow in the Champions League next season, he is still waiting to play at a major international tournament.\nHe was \"heartbroken\" to miss out on a place in Burundi's squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation (Afcon) as a 20-year-old, and the Swallows have not managed to qualify for the finals since.\nHowever, he is bullish about the country's chances of returning to Afcon in the near future \u2013 and going far at the tournament.\n\"There might be some challenges we don't always talk about, internal hurdles that we have to overcome, but ahead are three Afcons I want to lead my team to,\" he said.\n\"I'm now confident that I'll lead the Swallows to the upcoming 2027, 2029 and 2031 tournaments - and I believe that we will lift one of them.\"\nMeanwhile, Ndayishimiye is remembering his roots as he looks to the future.\nHe has ambitions to set up a football academy back in Burundi to support children from underprivileged families.\n\"A football career has a limited time span and I know that I have to make some savings, keeping in mind my poor background, so that I do not return to that life.\n\"That's advice I give my team-mates - manage your good salaries wisely so that we don't end up in regret.\n\"That's why, once I retire, I plan to open a school named after me.\"",

        "article_text": "During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed. \nBehind this authoritarian curtain, her Congress party government quietly began reimagining the country - not as a democracy rooted in checks and balances, but as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book.\nIn Indira Gandhi and the Years That Transformed India, Prof Raghavan shows how Gandhi's top bureaucrats and party loyalists began pushing for a presidential system - one that would centralise executive power, sideline an \"obstructionist\" judiciary and reduce parliament to a symbolic chorus.\nInspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. \nIt all began, writes Prof Raghavan, in September 1975, when BK Nehru, a seasoned diplomat and a close aide of Gandhi, wrote a letter hailing the Emergency as a \"tour de force of immense courage and power produced by popular support\" and urged Gandhi to seize the moment. \nParliamentary democracy had \"not been able to provide the answer to our needs\", Nehru wrote. In this system the executive was continuously dependent on the support of an elected legislature \"which is looking for popularity and stops any unpleasant measure\".\nWhat India needed, Nehru said, was a directly elected president - freed from parliamentary dependence and capable of taking \"tough, unpleasant and unpopular decisions\" in the national interest, Prof Raghavan writes.\nThe model he pointed to was de Gaulle's France - concentrating power in a strong presidency. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. He even proposed stripping fundamental rights - right to equality or freedom of speech, for example - of their justiciability.\nNehru urged Indira Gandhi to \"make these fundamental changes in the Constitution now when you have two-thirds majority\". His ideas were \"received with rapture\" by the prime minister's secretary PN Dhar. Gandhi then gave Nehru approval to discuss these ideas with her party leaders but said \"very clearly and emphatically\" that he  should not convey the impression that they had the stamp of her approval. \nProf Raghavan writes that the ideas met with enthusiastic support from senior Congress leaders like Jagjivan Ram and foreign minister Swaran Singh. The chief minister of Haryana state  was blunt: \"Get rid of this election nonsense. If you ask me just make our sister [Indira Gandhi] President for life and there's no need to do anything else\". M Karunanidhi of Tamil Nadu \u2013 one of two non-Congress chief ministers consulted - was unimpressed.\nWhen Nehru reported back to Gandhi, she remained non-committal, Prof Raghavan writes. She instructed her closest aides to explore the proposals further. \nWhat emerged was a document titled \"A Fresh Look at Our Constitution: Some suggestions\", drafted in secrecy and circulated among trusted advisors. It proposed a president with powers greater than even their American counterpart, including control over judicial appointments and legislation. A new \"Superior Council of Judiciary\", chaired by the president, would interpret \"laws and the Constitution\" - effectively neutering the Supreme Court.\nGandhi sent this document to Dhar, who recognised it \"twisted the Constitution in an ambiguously authoritarian direction\". Congress president DK Barooah tested the waters by publicly calling for a \"thorough re-examination\" of the Constitution at the party's 1975 annual session.\nThe idea never fully crystallised into a formal proposal. But its shadow loomed over the Forty-second Amendment Act, passed in 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers, limited judicial review and further centralised executive authority.\nThe amendment made striking down laws harder by requiring supermajorities of five or seven judges, and aimed to dilute the Constitution's 'basic structure doctrine' that limited parliament's power.\nIt also handed the federal government sweeping authority to deploy armed forces in states, declare region-specific Emergencies, and extend President's Rule - direct federal rule - from six months to a year. It also put election disputes out of the judiciary's reach.\nThis was not yet a presidential system, but it carried its genetic imprint - a powerful executive, marginalised judiciary and weakened checks and balances.  The Statesman newspaper warned that \"by one sure stroke, the amendment tilts the constitutional balance in favour of the parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, Gandhi's loyalists were going all in. Defence minister Bansi Lal urged \"lifelong power\" for her as prime minister, while Congress members in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh unanimously called for a new constituent assembly in October 1976.\n\"The prime minister was taken aback. She decided to snub these moves and hasten the passage of the amendment bill in the parliament,\" writes Prof Raghavan.\nBy December 1976, the bill had been passed by both houses of parliament and ratified by 13 state legislatures and signed into law by the president.\nAfter Gandhi's shock defeat in 1977, the short-lived Janata Party - a patchwork of anti-Gandhi forces - moved quickly to undo the damage. Through the Forty-third and Forty-fourth Amendments, it rolled back key parts of the Forty Second, scrapping authoritarian provisions and restoring democratic checks and balances.\nGandhi was swept back to power in January 1980, after the Janata Party government collapsed due to internal divisions and leadership struggles. Curiously, two years later, prominent voices in the party again mooted the idea of a presidential system.\nIn 1982, with President Sanjiva Reddy's term ending, Gandhi seriously considered stepping down as prime minister to become president of India. \nHer principal secretary later revealed she was \"very serious\" about the move. She was tired of carrying the Congress party on her back and saw the presidency as a way to deliver a \"shock treatment to her party, thereby giving it a new stimulus\".\nUltimately, she backed down. Instead, she elevated Zail Singh, her loyal home minister, to the presidency.\nDespite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system. Did Gandhi, a deeply tactical politician, hold herself back ? Or was there no national appetite for radical change and India's parliamentary system proved sticky?\nThere was a hint of presidential drift in the early 1970s, as India's parliamentary democracy - especially after 1967 - grew more competitive and unstable, marked by fragile coalitions, according to Prof Raghavan. Around this time, voices began suggesting that a presidential system might suit India better. The Emergency became the moment when these ideas crystallised into serious political thinking.\n\"The aim was to reshape the system in ways that immediately strengthened her hold on power. There was no grand long-term design - most of the lasting consequences of her [Gandhi's] rule were likely unintended,\" Prof Raghavan told the BBC.\n\"During the Emergency, her primary goal was short-term: to shield her office from any challenge. The Forty Second Amendment was crafted to ensure that even the judiciary couldn't stand in her way.\"\nThe itch for a presidential system within the Congress never quite faded. As late as April 1984, senior minister Vasant Sathe launched a nationwide debate advocating a shift to presidential governance - even while in power. \nBut six months later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in Delhi, and with her, the conversation abruptly died. India stayed a parliamentary democracy.  ",

        "article_text": "It was a killing that shocked India: Punjabi hip-hop star Sidhu Moose Wala shot dead through the windscreen of his car by hired gunmen.\nWithin hours, a Punjabi gangster named Goldy Brar had used Facebook to claim responsibility for ordering the hit.\nBut three years after the murder, no-one has faced trial - and Goldy Brar is still on the run, his whereabouts unknown.\nNow, BBC Eye has managed to make contact with Brar and challenged him about how and why Sidhu Moose Wala became a target.\nHis response was coldly articulate.\n\"In his arrogance, he [Moose Wala] made some mistakes that could not be forgiven,\"  Brar told the BBC World Service.\n\"We had no option but to kill him. He had to face the consequences of his actions. It was either him or us. As simple as that.\"\nOn a warm May evening in 2022, Sidhu Moose Wala was taking his black Mahindra Thar SUV for its usual spin through dusty lanes near his village in the northern Indian state of Punjab when, within minutes, two cars began tailing him.\nCCTV footage later showed them weaving through narrow turns, sticking close. Then, at a bend in the road, one of the vehicles lurched forward, cornering Moose Wala's SUV against a wall. He was trapped. Moments later, the shooting began.\nMobile footage captured the aftermath. His SUV was riddled with bullets, the windscreen shattered, the bonnet punctured.\nIn trembling voices, bystanders expressed their shock and concern.\n\"Someone get him out of the car.\"\n\"Get some water.\"\n\"Moose Wala has been shot.\"\nBut it was too late. He was declared dead on arrival at hospital - hit by 24 bullets, a post-mortem would later reveal. The 28-year-old rapper, one of modern-day Punjab's biggest cultural icons, had been gunned down in broad daylight.\nOutside the UK, watch on YouTube, or listen on BBC.com\nA cousin and a friend who had been in the car with Moose Wala at the time of the ambush were injured, but survived.\nSix gunmen were eventually identified. They carried AK-47s and pistols. In the weeks that followed the murder, about 30 people were arrested and two of the suspected armed men were killed in what the Indian police described as \"encounters\".\nYet even with arrests piling up, the motive remained murky.\nGoldy Brar, who claims to have ordered the hit, wasn't in India at the time of the killing. He is believed to have been in Canada.\nOur conversation with him unfolded over six hours, pieced together through an exchange of voice notes. It gave us a chance to find out why Moose Wala had been killed and to interrogate the motives of the man who claimed responsibility.\nSidhu Moose Wala was born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu in a Jat-Sikh family in rural Punjab, before moving in 2016 to Canada to study engineering - a journey familiar to hundreds of thousands in the Punjabi diaspora.\nBut it was there, far from his village of Moosa - the inspiration for his rap name - that he reinvented himself as one of Punjabi music's most influential artists. In just five years, Moose Wala became the unmistakable voice of Punjabi hip-hop.\nWith his signature swagger, flashy style, and lyrical grit, Moose Wala sang openly about identity and politics, guns and revenge, pushing the boundaries of what Punjabi music had been willing to say.\nHe was fascinated by rapper Tupac Shakur, who had been murdered, aged 25, in 1996. \"In terms of personality, I want to be like him,\" Moose Wala once told an interviewer. \"The day he died, people cried for him. I want the same. When I die, people should remember that I was someone.\"\nOver a brief but explosive career, the singer spotlighted the darker undercurrents of India's Punjab region - gangster culture, unemployment, and political decay - while evoking a deep nostalgia for village life.\nMoose Wala was also a global force. With more than five billion views of his music videos on YouTube, a Top 5 spot in the UK charts, and collaborations with international hip-hop artists including Burna Boy, Moose Wala swiftly built a fan base stretching across India, Canada, the UK and beyond, powered by a diaspora that saw him as both icon and insurgent.\nBut fame came at a cost. Despite his rising star and socially conscious lyrics, Moose Wala was drifting into dangerous territory. His defiant attitude, visibility, and growing influence had drawn the attention of Punjab's most feared gangsters. These included Goldy Brar, and Brar's friend Lawrence Bishnoi, who even then was in a high-security jail in India.\nNot much is known about Brar, apart from the fact he is on the Interpol Red Notice list, and is a key operative in a network of gangsters operated by Bishnoi \u2013 orchestrating hits, issuing threats and amplifying the gang's reach. It is thought he emigrated to Canada in 2017, just a year after Moose Wala himself, and initially worked as a truck driver.\nBishnoi, once a student leader steeped in Punjab's violent campus politics, has grown into one of India's most feared criminal masterminds.\n\"The first [police] cases filed against Lawrence Bishnoi were all related to student politics and student elections\u2026 beating a rival student leader, kidnapping him, harming him,\" according to Jupinderjit Singh, deputy editor of Indian newspaper the Tribune.\nThis led to a spell in jail which hardened him further, says Gurmeet Singh Chauhan, Assistant Inspector General of the Anti-Gangster Task Force of Punjab Police.\n\"Once he was in jail, he started to get deeper into crime. Then he formed a group of his own. When it became an inter-gang thing, he needed money for survival. They need more manpower, they need more weapons. They need money for all that. So, for money, you have to get into extortion or crime.\"\nNow 31, Bishnoi runs his syndicate from behind bars - with dedicated Instagram pages and a cult-like following.\n\"So while Bishnoi sits in jail, Brar handles the gangs,\" says Assistant Inspector General Chauhan.\nSecuring BBC Eye's exchange with Brar took a year of chasing - cultivating sources, waiting for replies, gradually getting closer to the kingpin himself. But when we got through to Brar, the conversation cast new light on the question of how and why he and Bishnoi came to see Moose Wala as an enemy.\nOne of the first revelations was that Bishnoi's relationship with Moose Wala went back several years, long before the singer's killing.\n\"Lawrence [Bishnoi] was in touch with Sidhu [Moose Wala]. I don't know who introduced them, and I never asked. But they did speak,\" said Brar.\n\"Sidhu used to send 'good morning' and 'good night' messages in an effort to flatter Lawrence.\"\nA friend of Moose Wala's, who spoke anonymously, also told us that Bishnoi had been in touch with Moose Wala as early as 2018, calling him from jail and telling him he liked his music.\nBrar told us that the \"first dispute\" between them came after Moose Wala had moved back to India. It began with a seemingly innocuous match of kabbadi - a traditional South Asian contact team sport - in a Punjabi village.\nMoose Wala had promoted the tournament which was organised by Bishnoi's rivals - the Bambiha gang - Brar told us, in a sport where match-fixing and gangster influence are rampant.\n\"That's a village our rivals come from. He was promoting our rivals. That's when Lawrence and others were upset with him. They threatened Sidhu and said they wouldn't spare him,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\nYet the dispute between Moose Wala and Bishnoi was eventually resolved by an associate of Bishnoi's called Vicky Middhukhera.\nBut when Middukhera himself was gunned down by gangsters in a parking lot in Mohali in August 2021, Brar told us Bishnoi's hostility towards Sidhu Moose Wala reached the point of no return.\nThe Bambiha gang claimed responsibility for killing Middukhera. The police named Moose Wala's friend and sometime manager Shaganpreet Singh on the charge sheet, citing evidence that Singh had provided information and logistical support to the gunmen. Singh later fled India and is believed to be in Australia. Moose Wala denied any involvement.\nThe Punjab police told the BBC there was no evidence linking Moose Wala to the killing or to any gang-related crime. But Moose Wala was friends with Shaganpreet Singh, and he was never able to shake off the perception that he was aligned with the Bambiha gang - a perception that may have cost him his life.\nAlthough he can cite no proof of Moose Wala's involvement, Brar remains convinced that the singer was somehow complicit in the killing of Middukhera. Brar repeatedly told us that Shaganpreet Singh had assisted the gunmen in the days before Middukhera's shooting - and inferred that Moose Wala himself must have been involved.\n\"Everyone knew Sidhu's role, the police investigating knew, even the journalists who were investigating knew. Sidhu mixed with politicians and people in power. He was using political power, money, his resources to help our rivals,\" Brar told BBC Eye.\n\"We wanted him to face punishment for what he'd done. He should have been booked. He should have been jailed. But nobody listened to our plea.\n\"So we took it upon ourselves. When decency falls on deaf ears, it's the gunshot that gets heard.\"\nWe put it to Brar that India has a judicial system and the rule of law - how could he justify taking the law into his own hands?\n\"Law.

Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand.

Wrestler Sakshi Malik told the BBC at the time that she believed \"the player was pressurised into withdrawing the charges\". Mr Singh refused to comment on the allegation, saying \"let law take its course\".\nOn Monday, legal news site Bar and Bench reported that the police had given a report in court seeking cancellation of the case as the minor wrestler's father said he had made a false complaint.\nThe prosecution lawyer said \"no corroborative evidence\" had been found in the allegations after a detailed investigation in the case.\nBar and Bench said the wrestler and her father had appeared before the court and expressed satisfaction with the police investigation. They also did not oppose the cancellation report.\nIn the aftermath of the row, Singh had stepped down as the wrestling federation chief.

        "article_text": "Nearly three weeks after Rohit Sharma's sudden retirement from Test cricket, the Indian cricket board has ended speculation of his successor by naming Shubman Gill as India's new captain for the upcoming five-Test series against England in June.\nAt 25, Gill becomes India's 37th Test captain - and one of its youngest, after Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri.\nHis appointment marks a turning point for Indian cricket. The squad he leads is without batting greats Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, spin stalwart R Ashwin who retired six months ago, and pace spearhead Mohammed Shami, who was sidelined due to fitness concerns.\nThe team is rich in young batting talent but will miss the experience of Kohli and Sharma. Despite Jaspreet Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, and Mohammad Siraj, the bowling attack still feels a touch raw. \nAdding to Gill's challenge: India haven't won a Test series in England since 2007.\nHis appointment followed intense deliberations between chief selector Ajit Agarkar, coach Gautam Gambhir, and backchannel talks with other contenders.\nThough Bumrah seemed the natural choice after serving as vice-captain in Australia, concerns over his ability to shoulder the workload of a five-Test series tipped the scales in Gill's favour.\nA prodigy from Punjab state, Gill has long carried the weight of expectation with elegance.\nHe burst into the spotlight in 2014, not yet 15, hammering 351 in a world-record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh in the Punjab Inter-District ML Markan Trophy. It was a knock that vindicated his family's bold move from the border village of Chak Kherewala to Mohali, seeking better training and greater exposure for the young talent.\nConsistent run-getting as a junior, fast-tracked him into the under-19 ranks which is where Gill really made his first big impact.\nVice-captain of the team that played the 2017-18 U-19 World Cup, he emerged as the top run aggregator for India, highlighted by a skilful, unbeaten 102 against arch rivals Pakistan in the semi-final. In the final where India beat Australia, Gill scored a handy 31.\nAt the time, all eyes were on Prithvi Shaw - the U-19 captain whose Mumbai schoolboy feats drew comparisons with Tendulkar. His rise was meteoric: a Test debut century, another soon after. But by 2020, his career had begun to unravel.\nTemporarily sidelined, Gill made an immediate impact on his Ranji Trophy debut with a half-century, followed by a century. Under Yuvraj Singh's mentorship, he sharpened both his batting and game awareness.\nProlific runs pushed selectors to consider Gill as Shaw's replacement. He debuted in Tests in Melbourne, December 2020, during India's memorable comeback series win.\nTall and graceful, Gill's technical precision and elegant stroke play - especially front of the wicket - set him apart as a promising young talent. Nicknamed the 'Prince' by his family, the title soon became his cricketing identity. Hailed as the Next Big Thing, he's widely tipped to succeed Virat Kohli as the next generation's leading batsman.\nThat promise remains unproven. Like Kohli, Gill is an all-format player, but unlike Kohli's early dominance, Gill has yet to display the same ambition and match-winning impact - especially in Tests, where his 1,893 runs in 32 matches are solid but not outstanding.\n\nGill's first captaincy, less than five years after his Test debut, comes at a crucial point in his career.\nWith enough international experience to elevate his batting from good to great, he now faces a stern test against England's Bazball style of play in challenging conditions. Success here would be a major boost to his standing as a top Test player.\nBut it is as captain that Gill probably faces tougher challenges.\nThe England series kicked off India's new World Test Championship cycle, following two finals appearances but a disappointing early exit in the last one. India's recent Test form has been poor, with back-to-back series losses to New Zealand and Australia.\nTo pull India out of the current rut, Gill will have to lead the way as batter as well as captain in charge of a new-look team, whose dressing-room and dynamics he will have to understand and, perhaps, reshape.\n\"Gill is a young man we are investing in not just for one series, but for the next five-six years to take Indian cricket ahead,'' said chief selector Ajit Agarkar.\nThat should be a tremendous reassurance for the new captain. While his appointment brings its share of pressure, it also carries immense hope - and an opportunity to carve his own legacy in Indian cricket history.",

        "article_text": "Shona Banu still shudders when she thinks of the past few days.\nThe 58-year-old, a resident of Barpeta district in India's north-eastern state of Assam, says that she was called to the local police station on 25 May and later taken to a point at the border with neighbouring Bangladesh. From there, she says, she and around 13 other people were forced to cross over to Bangladesh. \nShe says she was not told why. But it was a scenario she had been dreading - Ms Banu says she has lived in Assam all her life but for the past few years, she has been desperately trying to prove that she is an Indian citizen and not an \"illegal immigrant\" from Bangladesh.\n\"They pushed me over at gunpoint. I spent two days without food or water in the middle of a field in knee-deep water teeming with mosquitoes and leeches,\" Ms Banu said, wiping away tears. After those two days in no man's land - between India and Bangladesh - she says she was taken to what appeared to be an old prison on the Bangladeshi side.\nAfter two days there, she and a few others - she is not sure if all of them were from the same group sent with her - were escorted by Bangladeshi officials across the border, where Indian officials allegedly met them and sent them home.\nIt's not clear why Ms Banu was abruptly sent to Bangladesh and then brought back. But her case is among a spate of recent instances where officials in Assam have rounded up people declared foreigners by tribunals in the past - on suspicion of being \"illegal Bangladeshis\" - and sent them across the border. The BBC found at least six cases where people said their family members had been picked up, taken to border towns and just \"pushed across\".\nOfficials from India's Border Security Force, the Assam police and the state government did not respond to questions from the BBC.\nCrackdowns on alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are not new in India - the countries are divided by a 4,096km (2,545 miles) long porous border which can make it relatively easy to cross over, even though many of the sensitive areas are heavily guarded.\nBut it's still rare, lawyers working on these cases say, for people to be picked up from their homes abruptly and forced into another country without due process. These efforts seem to have intensified over the past few weeks.\nThe Indian government has not officially said how many people were sent across in the latest exercise. But top sources in the Bangladesh administration claim that India \"illegally pushed in\" more than 1,200 people into the country in May alone, not just from Assam but also other states. Out of this, they said on condition of anonymity, Bangladesh identified 100 people as Indian citizens and sent them back.\nIn a statement, the Border Guard Bangladesh said it had increased patrolling along the border to curb these attempts. \nIndia has not commented on these allegations.\nWhile media reports indicate that the recent crackdown includes Rohingya Muslims living in other states too, the situation is particularly tense and complex in Assam, where issues of citizenship and ethnic identity have long dominated politics. \nThe state, which shares a nearly 300km-long border with Muslim-majority Bangladesh, has seen waves of migration from the neighbouring country as people moved in search of opportunities or fled religious persecution.\nThis has sparked the anxieties of Assamese people, many of whom fear this is bringing in demographic change and taking away resources from locals.\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party - in power in Assam and nationally - has repeatedly promised to end the problem of illegal immigration, making the state's National Register of Citizens (NRC) a priority in recent years.\nThe register is a list of people who can prove they came to Assam by 24 March 1971, the day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan. \nThe list went through several iterations, and after a chaotic process, the final draft published in 2019 excluded nearly two million residents of Assam. Many of them say they already spent time in detention camps in the past after foreigners' tribunals - quasi-judicial forums - declared them illegal. Lawyers say people excluded from the final draft can only file an appeal once there is a gazette notification - an authorised legal government document. This hasn't been issued yet.\nMs Banu said her appeal against a foreigners' tribunal order is pending in the Supreme Court but that authorities still forced her to leave.\nThe BBC heard similar stories from at least six others in Assam - all Muslims - who say their family members were sent to Bangladesh around the same time as Ms Banu, despite having necessary documents and living in India for generations. At least four of them have now come back home, with no answers still about why they were picked up.\nA third of Assam's 32 million residents are Muslims and many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled there during British rule.\nMaleka Khatun, a 67-year-old from Assam's Barpeta who is still in Bangladesh, says she has temporarily been given shelter by a local family.\n\"I have no-one here,\" she laments. Her family has managed to speak to her but don't know if and when she can return. She lost her case in the foreigners' tribunal and in the state's high court and hadn't appealed in the Supreme Court.\nDays after the recent round of action began, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma cited a February Supreme Court direction which ordered the government to start deportation proceedings for people who had been \"declared foreigners\" but were still held in detention centres.\n\"The people who are declared foreigners but haven't even appealed in court, we are pushing them back,\" Sarma said. He also claimed that people with pending court appeals were not being \"troubled\".\nBut Abdur Razzaque Bhuyan, a lawyer working on many citizenship cases in Assam, alleged that in many of the recent instances, due process - which would, among other things, require India and Bangladesh to cooperate on the action - was not followed.\n\"What is happening is a wilful and deliberate misinterpretation of the court order,\" he said.\nMr Bhuyan recently filed a petition on behalf of a student organisation seeking the Supreme Court's intervention in stopping what they said was a \"forceful and illegal pushback policy\" but was asked to first approach the Assam high court.\nIn Morigaon, around 167km from Barpeta, Reeta Khanum sat near a table which had a pile of papers on it.\nHer husband Khairul Islam, a 51-year-old school teacher, was in the same group as Ms Banu that was allegedly picked up by authorities.\nA tribunal had declared him a foreigner in 2016, after which he spent two years in a detention centre before being released. Like Ms Banu, his case is also being heard in the Supreme Court.\n\"Every document is proof that my husband is Indian,\" Ms Khanum said, leafing through what she said was Mr Islam's high school graduation certificate and some land records. \"But that wasn't enough to prove his nationality to authorities.\" \nShe says her husband, his father and grandfather were all born in India.\nBut on 23 May, she says that policemen arrived at their home and took Mr Islam away without any explanation.\nIt was only a few days later - when a viral video surfaced of a Bangladeshi journalist interviewing Mr Islam in no man's land - that the family learnt where he was.\nLike Ms Banu, Mr Islam has now been sent back to India. \nWhile his family confirmed his return, the police told the BBC they had \"no information\" about his arrival.\nSanjima Begum says she is sure her father was declared a foreigner due to a case of mistaken identity - he was also taken on the same night as Mr Islam. \n\"My father's name is Abdul Latif, my grandfather was Abdul Subhan. The notice that came [years ago, from the foreigners' tribunal] said Abdul Latif, son of Shukur Ali. That's not my grandfather, I don't even know him,\" Ms Begum said, adding that she had all the necessary documents to prove her father's citizenship.\nThe family has now heard that Mr Latif is back in Assam, but he hasn't reached home yet.\nWhile some of these people are back home now, they fear they might be picked up again abruptly.\n\"We are not playthings,\" Ms Begum said. \n\"These are human beings, you can't toss them around as per your whims.\"\nAdditional reporting by Aamir Peerzada and Pritam Roy\nA line in the original article incorrectly said that many people left out of the final NRC draft were either put in detention camps or have appealed in higher courts. Many of those left out of the NRC had spent time in detention camps in previous years when they were deemed foreigners by Assamese tribunals and not after the publication of the final draft. Those excluded from the draft are yet to appeal against their exclusion as they are waiting for a gazette notification.",

        "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.\nThe recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\n\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\n\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.\nIndia and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. \nThe LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. \nCeasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)\nThe LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". \nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. \nNot surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\n\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.\nViolence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.\nThe 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.\nBetween 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \n\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.\nTensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\n\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.\nMr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\n\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.\nMr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.\nHe argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \nThe hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.\nSome experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\n\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"\nIn his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \n\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.\nToday, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\n\"You never know what will happen next.

        "summary": "\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. How India and Pakistan share one of the world's most dangerous borders7 days agoShareSaveSoutik BiswasIndia correspondent\u2022@soutikBBCShareSaveAFPA man stands inside his shell-hit home in Salamabad, Uri, near the Line of Control in Indian-administered KashmirTo live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. \"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.Mr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades.",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, zoologist Khlur Baiaineh Mukhim spotted something intriguing in a stream in a remote underground cave in India's north-eastern Meghalaya state.\nIt was a fish he had never seen before, with long barbels - the whisker-like protrusion around a fish's mouth - yellowish-green in colour and, most importantly, with eyes.\nCave-dwelling fish, or species of fish that live exclusively in caves, usually don't have  eyes, as they have adapted to living in darkness, which is why the fish Mr Mukhim spotted stood out to him. \nResearchers in Meghalaya now say it is a brand new species of fish, one that has adapted to living above as well as under the ground - a unique characteristic among cave-dwelling species.\nTheir findings were published earlier this month in the latest issue of the Journal of Fish Biology, a leading peer-reviewed publication on fish research.\nThe researchers have named the fish Schistura 'densiclava' after the thick black stripe on its tail. \nThey say that the species is endemic to the cave it was discovered in - Krem Mawjymbuin - in the eastern Khasi Hills, and has been found to exist in both water pools 60m (196ft) deep inside the cave, as well as a nearby stream above ground.\nDandadhar Sarma, a professor of zoology and one of the researchers of the study, says that the environment inside the cave is harsh, where temperatures drop to 18C (64.4F) - the ideal temperature for tropical fish to survive is much higher - and oxygen levels are extremely low.\n\"So it's remarkable that the fish can adapt to both - harsh subterranean conditions as well as more favourable surface conditions,\" Mr Sarma says.\nSchistura densiclava is the sixth cave-dwelling species of fish that has been discovered in Meghalaya over the past two to three decades, but the only one which has been found to show this ability to adapt to two very different kinds of environments.\nThe state is known to have some of the most complex cave systems in the world but many of its estimated 1,500 to 1,700 limestone and sandstone caves remain unexplored, as they are located in remote, forested regions that are challenging to access.\nThese cave networks are home to numerous animal species that display fascinating evolutionary characteristics but they remain  largely unknown because of insufficient research, Mr Sarma says.\nOver the past five years, a team of researchers from the state, funded by the federal government, have been systematically exploring Meghalaya's vast network of caves to locate and document new species of fish living inside them.\nIn 2019, the research team discovered Neolissochilus pnar, the largest cave-dwelling fish species in the world, Mr Sarma says.\nThe fish was found inside the Krem Umladaw cave in the western Jaintia Hills in a deep pond hundreds of metres below the ground.\nMr Mukhim, who is part of the team and has undertaken dozens of cave expeditions, says that cave-dwelling fish display evolutionary traits that are as fascinating as the those displayed by animals living at the Earth's poles or deep inside its oceans.\n\"Cave ecosystems are one of the harshest environments to live in,\" he says. \n\"These fish usually live in perpetual darkness, stagnant, shallow water pools with dangerously low oxygen levels and sometimes, go for months with little to no food.\"\nNature has helped them survive by doing away with the unwanted and strengthening what's necessary for survival. \nConsequently, they've lost their eyesight and ability to produce colourful pigments, which would otherwise be a needless waste of energy inside a pitch-dark cave.\nInstead, they have a sharper sense of taste and smell, and sensory organs on their skin help them detect vibrations to navigate the substrate and avoid predators. \nTheir sources of food include only what's available inside the cave, like leaf debris and marine organisms flushed in by seasonal floods, and even bat excreta.\nAnd within this extremely harsh environment, these cave-dwelling fish species live out their lives, some living up to a decade, and even produce offspring.\nRemarkably, their offspring are born with eyesight - a feature that links them to the surface-dwelling ancestors from which they've evolved - and gradually, they lose their eyesight as they age.\nBut searching for these fish is no easy task.\nIt involves rappelling down hundreds of metres into cavernous holes in the earth, squeezing through tiny tunnels with little oxygen and wading through pools filled with creatures yet unknown in pitch darkness.\n\"Our headlights are the only source of light,\" Mr Mukhim says.\nCatching fish involves squatting near pools for hours, and swiftly sweeping up the skittish creatures in a net as they present themselves.\nMr Mukhim, who has been studying fish found in the caves of Meghalaya for over a decade, says that there's a need to study these species as that is the only way we will be able to conserve them.\n\"Once a species is wiped out, you can never bring them back,\" Mr Mukhim says.\n\"It's painful to think that an entire ecosystem in our midst, one of the most fascinating ones, has been studied so little,\" he adds.\n\"It's time we paid a little more attention to these cave-dwelling marvels of nature.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. \nIn a message on his Truth Social site on Sunday, President Trump said that \"for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders\".\nThe reopening of Alcatraz - once notorious as one of the US's toughest prisons - would serve as a \"symbol of law, order, and justice,\" he said. \nLeading Democrats said the proposal was \"not a serious one\". The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and it is currently operating as a successful tourist site.\n\"Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,\" Trump wrote.\nThe prison would \"house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders\".\nPresident Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members there. He has also talked about sending \"homegrown criminals\" to foreign prisons. \nAlcatraz was originally a naval defence fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison. The Department of Justice took it over in the 1930s and it began taking in convicts from the federal prison system. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. \nThe prison was also made famous by the 1962 film, Birdman of Alcatraz, starring Burt Lancaster, about the convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who while serving a life sentence on the prison island developed an interest in birds and went on to become an expert ornithologist. \nIn 1979, the American biographical prison drama Escape from Alcatraz recounted a 1962 prisoner escape with Clint Eastwood starring as ringleader Frank Morris.\nIt was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz island. \nThe prison closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison website. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, largely due to its island location. \nIt would take an enormous amount of money to make Alcatraz into a functioning prison, Professor Gabriel Jack Chin from the Davis School of Law at the University of California told the BBC.  \nThe federal prison system is actually down about 25% from its peak population and \"there are a lot of empty beds\" in existing prisons, Chin said. \"So its not clear if a new one is needed.\"\nAlcatraz has \"a reputation as a tough prison\" and Trump is trying to send a message that his administration will be tough on crime, Chin added. \nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, said the proposal was \"not a serious one,\"  while the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, Scott Wiener, called the idea \"deeply unhinged\" in a post on Instagram and \"an attack on the rule of law.\"",

Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. \nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.\nIt is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.\nHowever, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.\nThe UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.\nOne of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.\nThe British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.\nBut it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.\nThis agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.\nThe UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily.\n\"It opens up a small number of visas from an existing route for chefs and musicians and yoga teachers, very, very small, about 1,800,\" he added.",

        "article_text": "Could India's decades-long jungle insurgency finally be approaching its end?\nLast week, the country's most-wanted Maoist, Nambala Keshava Rao - popularly known as Basavaraju - was killed along with 26 others in a major security operation in the central state of Chhattisgarh. Home Minister Amit Shah called it \"the most decisive strike\" against the insurgency in three decades. One police officer also died in the encounter.\nBasavaraju's death marks more than a tactical victory - it signals a breach in the Maoists' last line of defence in Bastar, the forested heartland where the group carved out its fiercest stronghold since the 1980s.\nMaoists, also known as \"Naxalites\" after the 1967 uprising in Naxalbari village in West Bengal, have regrouped over the decades to carve out a \"red corridor\" across central and eastern India - stretching from Jharkhand in the east to Maharashtra in the west and spanning more than a third of the country's districts. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh had described the insurgency as India's \"greatest internal security threat\".\nThe armed struggle for Communist rule has claimed nearly 12,000 lives since 2000, according to the South Asian Terrorism Portal. The rebels say they fight for the rights of indigenous tribes and the rural poor, citing decades of state neglect and land dispossession.\nThe Maoist movement - officially known as Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) - took formal shape in 2004 with the merger of key Marxist-Leninist groups into the CPI (Maoist). This party traces its ideological roots to a 1946 peasant uprising in the southern state of Telangana.\nNow, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government pledging to end Maoism by March 2026, the battle-hardened rebellion stands at a crossroads: could this truly be the end - or just another pause in its long, bloody arc?\n\"There will be a lull. But Marxist-Leninist movements have transcended such challenges when the top leadership of the Naxalites were killed in the 70s and yet we are talking about Naxalism,\" said N Venugopal, a  journalist, social scientist and long-time observer of the movement, who is both a critic and sympathiser of the Maoists. \nOne of the senior-most officials in India's home ministry who oversaw anti-Maoist operations, MA Ganapathy, holds a different view.\n\"At its core, the Maoist movement was an ideological struggle - but that ideology has lost traction, especially among the younger generation. Educated youth aren't interested anymore,\" says Mr Ganapathy.\n\"With Basavaraju neutralised, morale is low. They're on their last leg.\"\nThe federal home ministry's latest report notes a 48% drop in violent incidents in Maoist-related violence - from 1,136 in 2013 to 594 in 2023 - and a 65% decline in related deaths, from 397 to 138. \nHowever, it acknowledges a slight rise in security force casualties in 2023 compared to 2022, attributed to intensified operations in core Maoist areas.\nThe report says Chhattisgarh remained the worst-affected state in 2023, accounting for 63% of all Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) incidents and 66% of the related deaths. \nJharkhand followed, with 27% of the violence and 23% of the deaths. The remaining incidents were reported from Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.\nThe collapse of Maoism in Chhattisgarh, a stronghold of the insurgency, offers key clues to the movement's broader decline.\nA decade ago, the state's police were seen as weak, according to Mr Ganapathy.\n\"Today, precise state-led strikes, backed by central paramilitary forces, have changed the game. While paramilitary held the ground, state forces gathered intelligence and launched targeted operations. It was clear role delineation and coordination,\" he said.\nMr Ganapathy adds that access to mobile phones, social media, roads and connectivity have made people more aware and less inclined to support an armed underground movement.\n\"People have become aspirational, mobile phones and social media have become widespread and people are exposed to the outside world. Maoists also cannot operate in hiding in remote jungles while being out of sync with new social realities. \n\"Without mass support, no insurgency can survive,\" he says.\nA former Maoist sympathiser, who did not want to be named, pointed to a deeper flaw behind the movement's collapse: a political disconnect.\n\"They delivered real change - social justice in Telangana, uniting tribespeople in Chhattisgarh - but failed to forge it into a cohesive political force,\" he said.\nAt the heart of the failure, he argued, was a dated revolutionary vision: building isolated \"liberated zones\" beyond the state's reach and \"a theory to strike the state through a protracted people's war\".\n\"These pockets work only until the state pushes back. Then the zones collapse, and thousands die. It's time to ask - can a revolution really be led from cut-off forestlands in today's India?\"\nThe CPI (Maoist)'s 2007 political document clings to a Mao-era strategy: of creating a \"liberated zone\" and \"encircling the cities from the countryside.\" But the sympathiser was blunt: \"That doesn't work anymore.\"\nThe party still retains some popular support in a few isolated pockets, primarily in the tribal regions of eastern Maharashtra, southern Chhattisgarh and parts of Odisha and Jharkhand - but without a strong military base.\nOngoing operations by state forces have significantly weakened the Maoist military infrastructure in their strongholds in southern Chhattisgarh. Cadres and leaders are now being killed regularly, reflecting the rebels' growing inability to defend themselves.\nMr Venugopal believes the strategy needs rethinking - not abandonment.\nThe underground struggle has its place, he said, but \"the real challenge is blending it with electoral politics\".\nIn contrast, Mr Ganapathy sees little hope for the Maoists to mount a meaningful fightback in the near future and argues that the time has come for a different approach - dialogue.\n\"It would be wise for them to go for talks now and perhaps unconditionally or even lay down the conditions and let the government consider them. This is the time to approach the government instead of unnecessarily sacrificing their own cadres, without a purpose,\" he said.\nMaoists enjoy support in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from mainstream political parties. In Telangana, both the ruling Congress and the main opposition Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) have backed calls for a ceasefire, along with 10 smaller Left parties - an effort widely seen as aimed at protecting the group's remaining leaders and cadres. \nThe Maoist movement, rooted in past struggles against caste oppression, still carries social legitimacy in parts of these states. Civil society activists have also joined the push for a truce.\n\"We, along with other civil rights groups, demanded a two-step process - an immediate ceasefire followed by peace talks,\" said Ranjit Sur, general secretary of the Kolkata-based group Association for Protection of Democratic Rights.\nMaoist-affected states remain resilient strongholds in part because they are rich in minerals - making them sites of intense resource battles. Mr Venugopal believes this is key to the CPI (Maoist's) enduring presence.\nChhattisgarh, for instance, is India's sole producer of tin concentrates and moulding sand, and a leading source of coal, dolomite, bauxite and high-grade iron ore, according to the ministry of mines. \nIt accounts for 36% of the country's tin, 20% iron ore, 18% coal, 11% dolomite and 4% of diamond and marble reserves. Yet, despite strong interest, mining companies - both global and national - have long struggled to access these resources.\n\"Multinational companies couldn't enter because the Maoist movement, built on the slogan 'Jal, Jangal, Jameen (Water, Forest, Land),' asserted that forests belong to tribespeople - not corporations,\" Mr Venugopal said.\nBut with the Maoists now weakened, at least four Chhattisgarh mines are set to go to \"preferred bidders\" after successful auctions in May, according to an official notification. \nMr Venugopal believes that the resistance won't die with the death of Maoist leaders.\n\"Leaders may fall, but the anger remains. Wherever injustice exists, there will be movements. We may not call them Maoism anymore - but they'll be there.\"",
