        "article_text": "The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX company operates on the southern tip of Texas is to officially become a city called Starbase. \nResidents approved incorporating a patch of land as the new municipality in an election on Saturday.\nMost of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote \"Starbase, Texas is now a real city!\" on his social media platform X.\nThe new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.\nThe city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.\nSince SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.\nAbout 500 people are estimated to live nearby.\nThe possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.\nThe first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. \nThe BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.\nStarbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.\nA bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.\nCurrently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.\n\nThe result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.\nThe top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.\nIn recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.\nThe headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.\nIn contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers \u2013 most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.\nEnvironmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. \nIn 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.\nThe company has called the fines the result of \"disagreements over paperwork\" and maintains it follows environmental laws.

        "article_text": "Community leaders have called for people to stand united as tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following reported military strikes between the two countries.\nOn Wednesday, Indian forces launched \"Operation Sindoor\" targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in retaliation for a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed at least 26 people on 22 April. \nPakistan denies involvement, but Indian authorities allege attackers included Pakistani nationals.\nIn the west of England, the impact of the conflict is reverberating on families who are fielding anxious WhatsApp calls. Local leaders are also stepping forward to offer guidance and solidarity.\nThere is growing concern, not only for relatives overseas, but also over the risk of tensions disrupting the unity between communities in the region.\nBristol Green Party councillor Abdul Malik, who recently returned from his ancestral village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, said the escalation tension has \"caused a lot of grief\". \nAfter Wednesday's strikes in Pakistan, a gathering was held at Easton's Jamia Mosque. \n\"It's so important to give a sense of security to the elders who've lived most of their lives in the UK but still feel so connected to what happens abroad,\" said Mr Malik.\n\"This isn't a war about religion. This is a political war about borders. We must not bring hatred to our streets and our homes.\n\"Bristol has a wonderful Indian and Pakistani community. We've sat together. We've listened. This is the time to stand united - and that's what we intend to do.\"\n\"Trying to avoid any conflicts is my main concern,\" said Pankaj Pandya, one of the trustees of the Hindu Temple in Bristol. \n\"Hopefully it doesn't escalate, and it doesn't become tit-for-tat leading to an outright war between two nuclear nations.\n\"Being an Indian myself, it's a concern for not only what is happening between India and Pakistan, but just generally the issues of war throughout the world at the moment.\"\nLocal leaders in the west of England are also are urging communities not to spread misinformation online. \n\"There's a lot of fake information and false news being spread around which doesn't help the situation,\" said Atiff Ghafar, vice chair of the Swindon Pakistan Association.\n\"So, we have been telling and encouraging our communities not to share unverified news reports.\"\nPakistan says 36 people have been killed by Indian air strikes and firing. India says at least 16 people were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\n\"As someone from the Pakistani diaspora, it's quite sad to see that there's tensions between both communities and innocent lives have been lost on both sides of the border,\" said Mr Ghafar.\n\"We don't want anything to be spreading across to this part of the world as we have very good cordial and friendly relationships with our Indian diaspora community who have lived with us side by side for a good 50 to 60 years.\"\nOn 29 April, an interfaith and intercultural meeting was organised in Bristol by the International Human Rights Movement (HRM), Bristol Pakistani Forum and the Bristol Multi-Faith forum.\nRana Basharat Ali Khan, chairman of the HRM, said: \"It's so horrible to witness something like this in the 21st Century.\n\"It is not something we want to witness in this age, while we are fighting for justice.\n\"We need to change our priorities - we need to focus and invest on humans rather than defence and we need to come off this war affected mentality.\"\nIndian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency which has claimed thousands of lives.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over the area.\nFollowing the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, a Hindu prayer vigil was held on 27 April at the Hindu Garden of Peace in Gloucester to remember the victims of the deadly attack.\nSpeaking to the BBC Radio Gloucestershire at the vigil, Manish Jani said: \"It is something horrific against humanity, not just against one country.\" \nHema Patel echoed those emotions: \"Many people were killed, including Christians and Muslims. This is not about condemning any religion; we just pray for peace.\" \nDr Ashok and Dr Pravin Patel, co-chairs of the Hindu Cultural Association, both emphasised unity and empathy over division. \n\"The first religion is humanity,\" said Dr Pravin. \"Any heinous act by one human on another is a blot on humanity.\"\nThe Indian government says its forces have launched \"Operation Sindoor\", \"hitting terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir \"from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed\".\nIn a statement, the Indian government said that \"nine sites have been targeted\".\n\"Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution.\"\nThe statement adds that the attack was ordered after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.\n\"Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,\" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. \n\"But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.\"\nShe had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. \nMoving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.\nLovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.\n\"Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,\" Lovina jokes. \"I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.\"\nSo she posted an open message on her Facebook account: \"Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?\"\nTo her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.\nShe quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.\n\"I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,\" she says. \"I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.\"\nLovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. \nAccording to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. \nIndians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.\nFollowing that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. \nShortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.\nLovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupra\u2060, Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. \nThey say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.\nThe community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. \nThey say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. \nA member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.\n\"The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,\" she says.\nBeyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. \nIn one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. \nNishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.\n\"The group was her first port of call,\" says Nishi. \"As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.\"\nAnother woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.\n\"I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,\" Priya says.\n\"Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused.\" \nSo she asked the group and they offered advice.\nPriya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.\n\"The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,\" says Priya. \"I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.\"\nThere has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. \nLovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.\n\"I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,\" says Lovina.\n\"I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.\"\nLovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. \nIt has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation.\nThe World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority.\nThe members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.\n\"We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,\" says Lovina. \"I think that's the biggest support system for us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "From blossoming long-distance love to helping families stay connected, for years Skype held a unique place in people's hearts.\nIn the days before Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams, the video call service was once one of the world's most popular websites.\nIt allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world.\nIn recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Its services will close for good on 5 May, with the Skype for Business feature the only part to remain.\nHere are just some of the many people whose lives were touched by Skype since it launched in 2003.\nWeng and Owen Williams have a lot to thank Skype for - it is one of the main reasons they are married.\nIn 2012, Weng left Macau, China to start a six-month internship at a National Trust site in Carmarthenshire, Wales.\nFeeling a bit homesick, she would speak to friends and family on Skype. She then met Owen, who was also working for the National Trust.\nAt first they were friends, but after Weng returned to Macau, romance blossomed over months of Skype chats and visits to see one another.\n\"Skype was a very important part of our relationship,\" she said. \nWhen they decided to embark on a long-distance relationship, Skype was the glue that held it together.\nThey video called every day - including when Weng sent Owen a birthday cake and he cut it in front of her during their chat.\n\"That was quite sweet,\" she said. \"Skype just kept us going.\"\nThe pair ultimately got engaged, and Weng moved back to Wales in 2015.\nNow, they are happily married.\nLike many over the years, Erica from New Zealand used Skype to communicate with a loved one while they were in another part of the world. \nIn her case, it was her husband when one of them was on a work trip.\nFollowing his death in 2017, Skype took on another role for Erica, who spoke to the BBC anonymously.\n\"I was clearing out his files to decommission his work computer,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I had the opportunity to review these messages we had exchanged and realised how they inadvertently documented a period of distress and heartache in our relationship.\"\nWhat Erica did next tried to bring some closure to this difficult period in her life.\n\"I sent a posthumous message to his Skype address to which, I - or he - replied from his computer,\" she said.\nErica said she then began a brief conversation back and forth \"over a period of weeks\" - where she would send a message to his Skype address, then reply to herself from his account.\n\"In this exchange, we responded to each other's messages and questions with all the apologies and regret that we needed to hear from each other,\" she said. \n\"It helped me to move on. I believed it.\"\nSince 2003, Susan Bertotti has lived in Chile. Skype has been her way of keeping in touch with her mum Vera, who lives in in Milton Keynes.\nFor the past 15 years, they have spoken to each other every day they are apart on Skype.\nFrom sharing Christmas memories to showing each other their gardens in Chile and England, the video call app has been a constant.\n\"Skype has given my mother and I the most wonderful close connection all these years,\" Susan said.\nWhen she became her mum's carer, Susan used the app to deal with all her life admin back in the UK. \nAs the years went on, the family starting using WhatsApp, but they still use Skype to set up their chats. Vera is now 99.\n\"It is going to be a huge loss to me,\" Susan said.\n\"I'll be back to making lost-distance calls now on her behalf, and that will be horrible, or I'll have to email.\n\"I'm so disappointed about losing Skype.\"\nBeing able to call internationally without big fees are an important part of Stan Calderwood's business. \nOn the day it was announced the service would close, he had used it eight times to call estate agents, accountants and lawyers in Canada about the sale of a property there.\n\"You can't call everyone on WhatsApp, Zoom or Teams,\" he said.\n\"You do have to call people on their mobiles and their landlines, particularly businesses.\"\nStan is now looking for a new low-cost alternative for cheap international calls.\nWhile Skype fell away in recent years, it still had millions of users - with the website Statista stating it had almost 28 million as of March last year. \nSo what will happen now? \nMicrosoft says Skype's free services will be retired, and users have a choice - move over to Teams, or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history.\n\"The timing of this shift is driven by the significant advancements and adoption of Microsoft Teams,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\"Teams free offers many of the same core features as Skype.\"\nMeanwhile, the firm says its Skype for Business users are unaffected by the change and the service will continue. \nOne of those customers is the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Its spokesperson told the BBC the MoD is retiring most of its Skype service as it moves to Teams, but a \"small group of users\" will continue using the business version of Skype.\nFor Skype customers who pay a subscription or have credits to make calls to landlines and mobiles, they will be able to use Skype Dial Pad on Teams. When their credit or subscription ends, there will be no way to continue using it.\nSkype as we know it is going - and with it, one of the the most recognisable tech products of this century.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

        "article_text": "More than two million people have attended a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, city officials say. \nThe pop star's biggest ever concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy. \nThey expect it could bring in $100m (\u00a375m) to the local economy. \nSaturday's performance was part of a promotional tour for Lady Gaga's eighth album, Mayhem, whose songs include Abracadabra and Die With a Smile. She last performed in Brazil in 2012.\nSome fans - known as Gaga's \"Little Monsters\" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.\nA massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event. \nLady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.\n\n\"You waited for me, you waited for more than 10 years for me,\" an emotional Lady Gaga told the crowds as she unfurled a Brazilian flag.  \n\"Brazil, I'm ready. I'm going to give it my all.\"\nThe pop star appeared in Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team. \nThousands sang along with her best known hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra, creating an electric atmosphere as many waved rainbow-themed fans and watched on huge screens along the beach. \nFans travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance.  \nOne man, 28-year-old Luan Messias, said he spent all night on a bus from Itanhaem in neighbouring Sao Paulo state.\nAlisha Duarte, 22, told AFP news agency she started queuing at 0740 in the morning. \"Lady Gaga is worth it! It's going to get super crowded, but we'll survive,\" she said. \nAnother fan, Paulo Oliveira, explained why people were so excited about the concert. She \"tells us that we can be who we are, that we can be different and that being different is cool,\" he told Reuters. \nIt's going to be an \"unforgettable show\", concert attendee Lai Borges told Reuters on her way in. \"It's going to be emotional and I'm going to cry a lot,\" she said. \nAs the event drew to a close, Lady Gaga told the audience - in a reference to the nickname for Lady Gaga fans - \"we are monsters and monsters never die,\" and she brought the concert to a close with Bad Romance, perhaps her most famous song.",

        "article_text": "Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade \"reset\" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.\nLast week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.\nAs a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either \"stall\" or \"head back\", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI). \n\"India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.\"\nThe change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.\nThat may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was \"one of the highest tariff nations in the world\".\n\"India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,\" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were \"similar to those exported by China\".\nThere were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.\nNomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing \"anecdotal evidence\" of India emerging as a winner from \"trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing\" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.\nSome analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade \"reset\" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.\nFor one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.\nIndia and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called \"China exodus\" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.\nIndia has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.\nBut all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.\nApart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also \"not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars\", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month. \n\"Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.\"\nA tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.\nThe Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.\nThe government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's \"limited success\" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind. \nAnother major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.\n\"India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,\" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.\nAccording to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.\n\"Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,\" Mr Srivastava said.\nThe jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.\nQuite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, \"today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India\", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme. \nFinally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.\nIndia doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry \u2013 a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.\nBut experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.\nAll of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.\n\"Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,\" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post. \n\"Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.\" \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the \"capture\" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a \"forceful operation\" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population \"will be moved, to protect it\".\nHe did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that \"they will not enter and come out\".\nThe cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.\nThe UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.\nA Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's \"pressure and blackmail\".\nAsked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there.\nThe UK meanwhile said it \"does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza\". The EU earlier urged restraint, saying it was concerned about \"further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population\".\n\nIsrael's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March.\nAn Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to \"defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages\".\n\"The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,\" the official said.\nIsraeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated \"buffer zone\" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nLater, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called \"a window of opportunity\" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. \nFar-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was \"going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip\", according to Reuters news agency.\nIsrael occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline.\nIn a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued. \nHowever, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas.\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was \"choosing territories over the hostages\" and that this was \"against the will of over 70% of the people\" in Israel.\nHamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including \"a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides\".\nPalestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes.\n\"In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,\" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said.\n\"We lived through unbearable conditions in what Israel claimed was a 'safe zone' in the south. This time, we will not leave, even if Israel brings down the tents over our heads.\"\nOsama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: \"Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.\"\nThe Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority \"the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities\".\nThe security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a \"sterile area\" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection.\nOn Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to \"shut down the existing aid distribution system\" and \"have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings\".\nThe HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies.\n\"It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic \u2013 as part of a military strategy,\" it said.\n\"It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.\"\nIsrael cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive.\nAccording to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies.\nThe blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system.\nThe UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 52,567 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,459 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "Sam Simmonds, the then Exeter number eight, was the bolter in 2021's socially distanced squad announcement\nBolter: Noun, Australian informal - an outsider in a contest or race.\nPerhaps it was a term picked up on a previous tour down under. For whatever reason, in the northern hemisphere at least, the concept of a bolter has become synonymous with Lions squad selection.\nIt refers to the inexperienced, overlooked and out of favour. Players propelled from leftfield to centre stage and on to the plane with the best of Britain and Ireland.\nBack row Sam Simmonds, who had not been chosen for England in three years, was that pick when the Lions toured South Africa in 2021.\nSome bolters have blossomed into Lions greats.\nJeremy Guscott and Martin Johnson had each made just one appearance for England before playing for the Lions. Jason Robinson was still learning the game after switching from rugby league.\nOther gambles have not paid such dividends.\nHere are nine potential picks, all less than probable but the right side of impossible, to listen out for when Wales great Ieuan Evans announces the squad on Thursday.\nFarrell has not played Test rugby since 2023, after taking a break from internationals before moving to Racing 92\n\"I'd pick Owen Farrell. Who do you want in there when the going gets tough? Test-match animals.\"\nBack in October when he was asked by the Times who should start at fly-half, external for the first Test against the Wallabies, Johnny Sexton was retired from playing, working for a glass company and publicising his autobiography.\nNow, intriguingly, Sexton has been signed up as a coach for the tour.\nThe fallout would be substantial, but head coach Andy Farrell might judge selecting his son worth it.\nWith little Lions Test experience among other potential 10s, three-time tourist Farrell brings an accountability and intensity few can match.\nEven as a 21-year-old tour rookie in Australia in 2013, his communication and leadership were picked out as an example to the rest of the squad by captain Alun Wyn Jones.\nFarrell has endured a difficult, injury-interrupted season with French club Racing 92, though he and his team have come into some welcome form recently, winning five out of seven matches since the former Saracen's comeback from a groin problem in March.\nHowever, his final chance to press his case ended early when a head knock forced an early exit from Sunday's European Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Lyon \nMurray was born and brought up in New Zealand but qualifies for Wales via his mother\nAfter a wretched run of 17 successive Test defeats and with no Welsh voice among Andy Farrell's support staff, representation from The Dragons could be at an all-time low.\nWales have never supplied fewer than five players for a Lions squad. If they are to get up towards that figure again, then Blair Murray could be on the plane.\nThe Lions do not have huge depth at full-back.\nIreland's Hugo Keenan will likely tour, but Scotland's first-choice 15 Blair Kinghorn suffered a knee knock recently and would be a late arrival on tour with Toulouse destined for Top 14 play-offs.\nEngland have shuffled between George Furbank, Freddie Steward and Marcus Smith over the past year.\nMurray, all scampering pace and jagging sidesteps, would be a crowd-pleasing pick.

        "article_text": "For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.\nThose in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi. \nOn Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US. \nLater, in another post he said: \"I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir.\" \nThe Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.\nSeveral rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.\nThe latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.\nIndia blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.\nTrump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.\nThe two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.\nWhile US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.\n\"Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,\" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.\nIslamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.\n\"We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,\" a  foreign ministry statement said..\nDelhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.\nPresident Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to \"internationalise\" the Kashmir dispute.\nThe main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the \"ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first\".\n\"Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,\" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed \"to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site\". This has caught the Indians by surprise.\nDelhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.\nHistorically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they \"resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations\".\nIndian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.\nThe conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.\nBut Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.\"\nIt is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.\nThe view from Pakistan is different. \n\"Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,\" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.\n\"Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,\" Mr Gul says.\nPakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.\n\"Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,\" Mr Ali says.\nIndia's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.\nBut it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances. \nThe US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.\nThe previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds. \nThe US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (\u00a398bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.\nDelhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or \"understanding\" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US. \nAny attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of.",

During his final speech on Easter Sunday, he urged all \"warring parties\" to agree to a ceasefire and spoke of the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis. \nDuring 18 months of war, he reportedly called parishioners in Gaza nightly to check on their wellbeing, and suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide \u2013 an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.\nThe popemobile is one of a number of specially converted vehicles allowing the pontiff to greet huge crowds of well-wishers during official visits.

        "article_text": "Plans to turn land being used for the production of food into farms harvesting the power of the sun often see campaigns fought through the planning process.\nFor some these glimmering, undulating landscapes of panels are now as much a part of the countryside as the fields they inhabit, but for others, the feeling is they are totally at odds with it.\nHeading out of the Leicestershire market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch on almost any of its roads, once you pass a handful of entrances to housing estates of varying ages, you arrive in the National Forest countryside.\nOn a sunny spring morning, it is a glorious place to be.\nBut around Ashby these open spaces are not a green wedge, so much as a buffer of fields covered in panels harvesting green energy.\nWalking along the roadside in Shellbrook, on the western edge of the town, the chirpy song of chiffchaffs, blackcaps and robins in the hedgerows now mixes with the buzz of kit working away inside the green metal boxes behind the chain link fencing beyond them.\nOne homeowner nearby said they had not objected but were now living with the hum of the solar farm nearby, while one man living near to Ashby's biggest collection of panels, who did not wish to be named, told me all solar farms \"need a bomb putting under them\".\nHe fumed that having one on his doorstep had devalued his property, and that acres upon acres of \"valuable farmland\" were lost to the scheme.\nThese are arguments routinely put to planning officers and council committees the length and breadth of the country - that these renewable schemes lead to the loss of productive farmland, and come at a cost to the look of the landscape.\nThese battles are fought increasingly regularly, some are won by developers, and some are lost. But when the dust settles and one is built, what is it really like?\nFor more of the Ashby residents I spoke to, where the panels were mostly put in about a decade ago, there are drawbacks, despite most people having much less incendiary views on the solar farms next door.\nBut the overall consensus was - they do not really bother them.\nJohn Gillespie, 41, said the solar panels a stone's throw from his house were not flagged when he bought his home recently, and having them nearby had not affected him.\nHe said: \"As the population grows, we need more energy.

I don't think there were any written objections and I went to the council meeting, in which it was dealt with very quickly and without objections.\"\nThe government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the BBC that solar was \"at the heart\" of work to generate green energy.\nA spokesperson said: \"As of September last year, solar farms covered around 0.1% of the total land area of the UK, while bringing huge benefits for the British public and our energy security.\n\"Projects are subject to a rigorous planning process, in which the views and interests of the local community and impacts on the local environment, including any impact on amenities, landscapes and land use, are considered.\"\nWhile solar farms on fields are not set to disappear - especially those already built with lifetimes in their decades - the future of solar may be starting to move up towards the rooftops of the UK.\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government is set to publish new guidance on homebuilding \"later this year\", it said, which would \"maximise the installation of solar panels on new homes\".\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote \"Starbase, Texas is now a real city!\" on his social media platform X.\nThe new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.\nThe city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.\nSince SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.\nAbout 500 people are estimated to live nearby.\nThe possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.\nThe first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. \nThe BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.\nStarbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.\nA bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.\nCurrently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.\n\nThe result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.\nThe top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.\nIn recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.\nThe headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.\nIn contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers \u2013 most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.\nEnvironmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. \nIn 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.\nThe company has called the fines the result of \"disagreements over paperwork\" and maintains it follows environmental laws.

Trying to find the limit. I had a tiny moment into Turn One trying to find more time there but it's very tricky here with the tyres. It's qualifying, try to correct it and floor it out of the corner.\"\nIt was a second piece of good news for the four-time champion this week, after the birth of his first child, a daughter called Lily.\nNorris said: \"Congrats to Max, especially being a dad now. I was hoping it would slow him down a bit but it clearly didn't.\n\"Max did a Max lap again and I'm happy for him. The pace is there. I have been feeling good. It is what it is, I'm P2, Max on pole, ready to see what I can do into Turn One.\"\nAntonelli's third place proved his pole in the sprint on Friday was not a flash in the pan, on a weekend where he is showing the spark of prodigious talent that convinced Mercedes to put the 18-year-old straight into their team in his debut season. He beat team-mate George Russell by 0.114secs.\nIt also made amends to some degree for a disappointing sprint result, where he lost the lead at the start and then was hit by Verstappen's car in the pits and finished seventh.\n\"This weekend is going well so far,\" he said. \"It was a bit disappointing this morning, but happy to bounce back. I was a bit too greedy into Turn One but the rest of the lap was quite good. The gaps are super-tight.\"\nPiastri, winner of the last two races to put him into the championship lead, said his fourth place was down to \"poor execution - there was quite a bit left on the table\".\nA strong showing for Williams in sixth and seventh underlined the troubles of Ferrari, where Leclerc was 0.483secs off the pace and Hamilton failed to make it into the top 10 shootout.\nHe was just 0.058secs off Leclerc in the second session, but that was enough for four places, and it left him ruing a decision not to use an extra set of new tyres that he had available.\n\"It's always a surprise every session you go out what the car is doing,\" Hamilton said. \"It's a bit of a mess at the moment balance-wise. Unfortunate to have not got through. Same old.\"\nLeclerc said: \"It is just not good enough. It is frustrating because it is those kind of days and it has been quite a few races already that I feel I am doing a really good job. But when you are finishing P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, it is just a shame. I have no satisfaction of doing a good job.\n\"I am just hoping we can turn the situation around as soon as possible but at the moment that is the situation we are in and there is not much I can do.\"\nMiami Grand Prix practice times, sprint result and qualifying\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nMiami Grand Prix qualifying review",

So yeah, he's fighting, that is always expected, but that's what it is.\"\nVerstappen said: \"Honestly it's not frustrating at all (to lose a podium). We are here to win and today we were miles off that, so it doesn't really matter if you are a P3 or P4.\n\"I had nothing to lose, so I also just wanted to have a bit of fun out there.\"\nNorris lost out on a likely race win as a result of his first-lap incident with Verstappen.\nHe challenged the Red Bull on the outside of the first corner, and when Verstappen ran slightly deep, Norris cut back and tried to pass around the outside of the second corner.\nVerstappen took the racing line, appearing to flick his car towards Norris, and the McLaren went off the track into the run-off area and slipped to sixth.\nHad he backed off, Norris could have been the leading McLaren driver to attack Verstappen and given the car's dominant pace may well have won the race.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"With the benefit of hindsight, let's say that considering the situation in corner one-two, it could have been better for Lando to just lift and make sure that he could keep the second position because the car, again, with the benefit of hindsight, we see that he was very fast and he would certainly have passed Max, like Oscar, and then later Lando was in condition to do.\n\"So I think like every situation in racing, you have to approach with the mindset of reviewing where the opportunities lie. And I think in this case, Lando could have been a little bit more patient.\"\nNorris was further delayed in racing Verstappen because he passed him at Turn 11 by going off track and had to give the place back, before regaining it for good the following lap.\nStella said he saw no difference in his two drivers' approaches to racing Verstappen.\n\"Both drivers were approaching the overtaking in a way that had Lando not gone off by a few centimetres in corner 11, he would have completed the overtaking in what was a similar time. So I don't think we should over-read too much into situations. I think it's, like I said before, it's a matter sometimes of a fraction of a second or a fraction of a metre.\n\"The big time loss came because of having to give back the position. So I think in terms of overtaking manoeuvre and precision and determination, I don't see that there's any difference between both drivers.\"\nOnce he passed Verstappen, Norris closed on Piastri in the second stint, but ran out of time to close the gap.\nMcLaren dominated in Miami with a one-two in the sprint and main race\nPiastri's win was his third in a row and fourth in six races and he leads Norris by 16 points in the championship, with Verstappen a further 16 adrift.\nThe Australian said: \"It was tough at the beginning trying to get past Max. I tried pretty hard to get past, with everything still on my car.\n\"It was not easy but I picked my moments when I needed to. I could tell that we had a lot of pace from the get-go today, and it was going to be a matter of when I got past, not if.\n\"But I wanted to do it as efficiently as I could because I knew once Lando got back behind me, he was going to be catching us a lot. I wanted to get through quickly but cleanly. I felt like I did a pretty good job of that, then built a gap. Maybe not the strongest second half of the race of my life, but I think building that gap and being quick at the right times was what I needed.\n\"It was a matter of just biding my time, waiting for a moment, or forcing him into a moment. That's what I was able to do. Once I got past, I knew I had to try and build a gap while Lando was behind him.

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

Everyone onboard was seasick and some discussed turning back.\nEventually the Arnefjord made it safely across and delivered crews and passengers to the island of Mousa in Shetland.\nBut others were not so lucky. Of the six boats that crossed the North Sea with the Arnefjord that weekend, only four made it.\nIn total, 10 fishing boats were lost during the Shetland Bus convoys and 44 men lost their lives.\nThe current skipper of the MK Arnefjord, Morten Neset, is making the return journey back to Shetland as part of the VE Day commemorations.\nHe told BBC Scotland News that the boats had to make the crossings in the winter or late autumn to avoid being detected by the Germans. \n\"If they crossed on a clear summer day, they would be spotted straight away,\" he said. \n\"The Shetland Bus was really important for the general population of Norway as it showed that someone was 'standing up for them' in their resistance against the occupation.\"\nBill Moore, from the Shetland Bus Friendship Society, said that, although it was difficult to say what impact it had on the war, it was an important part of the resistance movement which gave optimism and hope to the people in Norway. \nPeople said they were \"taking the Shetland Bus\" as a code for escaping the occupation.\nShetland residents hosted soldiers and refugees from Norway throughout the war, forming a close bond between the two locations that endures to this day.",

People said they were \"taking the Shetland Bus\" as a code for escaping the occupation.Shetland residents hosted soldiers and refugees from Norway throughout the war, forming a close bond between the two locations that endures to this day.Royal NavyShetlandNorwayWorld War Two \"The Shetland Bus was really important for the general population of Norway as it showed that someone was 'standing up for them' in their resistance against the occupation.",

        "article_text": "Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. \nThe city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. \nThree people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday.\nBengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. \nMany parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. \nThis is \"rare\" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. \nApart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. \nIn one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee.\nVideos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. \nAuthorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to \"rectify\" the situation. \n\"There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,\" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. \nBut officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. \n\"No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,\" a user wrote on X.\nAnnu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. \n\"Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,\" she said. \nItty, who works in public policy, says a \"lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits\", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. \nKarnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.\nThe BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, \u00a387.5m) for relief operations.\nThe state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.\n\"The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,\" Shivakumar said.\nFloods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.\nAnanda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused \"discomfort and inconvenience\" for businesses. \n\"Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,\" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure. \n",

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

        "article_text": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.\nYet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.\nEven scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. \nSix years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. \nAs the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.\nPresident Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\n\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.\nIndia and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.\nThe bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \n\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.\nOne reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.\nSince testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. \nIndia, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.\nFurther ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.\nIn 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.\nIn his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.\nAround the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. \nFormer Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \n\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.\nBut nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.\nIn March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)\nYet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \n\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \n\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\n\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.\nAt the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. \nWith new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  \nAnd as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.\nDespite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.\nYet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\n\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\n\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\"",

        "article_text": "An 84-year-old belly dancer, whose twisting tummy was once frowned upon during a British midriff crisis, has urged people of all ages to keep active as she reflects on her career.\nTina Hobin, from Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, teaches a belly dancing class every week and says she is the oldest professional belly dancer in the UK.\n\"Life is precious,\" she said, taking stock of her art. \"Exercise and dancing gives people a purpose... it's important because it improves muscle tone.\" \nMs Hobin said that too many people were sitting down and watching TV instead of moving, which could cause back pain and mobility issues. But can shaking one's hips really avoid creaking hips? \nWell, according to Ms Hobin, her particular form of activity - a dance originating in ancient Egypt - has helped many of her students with physical health problems, including strengthening the upper back as well as boosting flexibility.\n\"It's changed my life,\" she said. \"It's fantastic, it raises your energy levels and people can't believe my age, I've stayed slim since my 30s.\"\nShe said the dance emerged after women in labour were encouraged to concentrate on their pelvic and abdominal regions to avoid the pain of contractions.\n\"Women tend to fight against contraction, but through the movements [they went with it], it's just nature,\" she said.\nBut such undulations - when presented on stage - once confused Britain which, she explained, could not easily disassociate the art from sex. \nMs Hobin said there was a lack of understanding about belly dancing, particularly regarding sexualisation, whether that be through deliberate presentation or flawed perception, both of which she was against. \n\"I was doing a lot of TV,\" she said of her past, \"and producers told me there hadn't been a belly dancer who had gone far [on screen]. That really, really annoyed me - they assumed [I was like] a stripper or prostitute.\n\"In this country, [the dance was mostly performed] in nightclubs [or by] strippers.\n\"I don't encourage people to come showing their bellies and boobs. I like to encourage women from all walks of life, all shapes and ages \u2013 there's not a particular image you have to emulate.\"\nIt's all meant that she somewhat struggles with the term belly dancing, although admits it's the one by which people most easily recognise the form.\nShe said she preferred to call it \"the sacred dance of life\", or at least \"belly dancing for health and fitness\".\nMs Hobin said she had seen women's confidence and self-esteem blossom after taking up the dance.\n\"I've seen women who have been divorced and their husbands left them for someone else,\" she said.\n\"They didn't think they were good enough anymore, but they do dancing and it's helped them get in touch with themselves.\n\"[I've also seen] people who have been abused and said it helped them get in touch with their body and sexuality again.\"\nMs Hobin said she was introduced to belly dancing in the 1970s. \nAfter seeing a newspaper article about a class, she thought the dancer looked \"elegant and lovely\" and decided to become a member. She said she had never looked back.\n\nShe has been teaching her own classes since 1974 - with students including inmates at a women's prison - and has been invited all over the world to host belly dancing workshops.\nAnd there are no plans to stop.\n\"I'll dance until I'm 120,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Rangers have performed well against Celtic but slipped up far too often to challenge their old rivals for the Scottish Premiership crown\nThe angst of a football manager's life was writ large over Barry Ferguson's contorted frame in the dying seconds of the last Old Firm derby of the season.\nA Rangers throw-in down the Celtic end and an opportunity for James Tavernier to hurl one towards the box in the hope of something happening to turn a 1-1 draw into a win.\nInstead, Hamza Igamane gets it and flings it back towards his own goal, whereupon Rangers are mugged and Celtic are away. Daizen Maeda, their principal goalscorer all season, is scampering into the Rangers penalty area - and Ferguson is practically jumping out of his own skin in frustration.\nGesticulating madly, he's like a man who's been given electric shock treatment. From the gantry up above, you could almost feel his pain.\nCeltic blew that moment, of course, but in real time you'd have bet money on Maeda picking out Johnny Kenny for a fairly routine tap-in winner. \nAt least Ferguson and the Rangers fans were spared that misery and the industrial-scale mocking that would have followed. The smallest mercy towards the end of a largely merciless season.\nFerguson retains hope of keeping Rangers head coach role\nRangers condemn 'unacceptable' banner and throwing of bottle\nIdah's Celtic equaliser leaves Rangers without home win in seven\nIn the wake of Philippe Clement's demise, Ferguson and his coaches - Billy Dodds, Neil McCann and Allan McGregor - were sent into Ibrox as some kind of survival experts, but it hasn't worked. Too many ills, too much damage done before they arrived, too little time to work on a solution.\nYou sense Ferguson has dedicated all his waking hours to this cause, that he's emptied himself into the role with abandon. He's spoken brilliantly, he's sent out all the right messages, he's practically tattooed the word BELIEVE on his forehead in an attempt to drag his players out their torpor.\nIt's not been enough to address the bizarre contradictions at the heart of this team, a gang of players with a twin personality; confident and dangerous against good teams, afflicted by uncertainty and impotence against supposedly inferior opposition.\nRangers have gone away to Fenerbahce and won a Europa League match but have been knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Queen's Park, the eighth-best team in the Championship.\nUnder Ferguson, they've beaten Brendan Rodgers' runaway champions in their own backyard at Celtic Park (scoring three times) and yet they've lost at home to Queen's Park, St Mirren and Motherwell (scoring once), though only the latter fixture was on Ferguson's watch.\nThey reached the last eight in Europe but haven't won in seven games at Ibrox. They've lost one in four in the league against Celtic, but they're 17 points behind them. They've outscored Celtic 7-6 in Old Firm games, but Celtic can't even see them in their rear-view mirror.\nAcross the span of the league, Rangers' record against Celtic is markedly better than their record against St Mirren, who are sixth. They've dropped as many points against Hibernian, Aberdeen and Motherwell as they have against Rodgers' serial league winners. Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham Hotspur only got a draw against them in Europe. Seven different domestic teams (including cup ties) have beaten them.\nThe fans have repeatedly turned on Cyriel Dessers, who has now scored 25 goals this season and has 47 goals in 107 games, while giving little of the same kind of vitriol to Danilo, who they signed for \u00a36m for a return (when fit) of 12 in 46.\nVery little of this makes sense. Not for the first time this season, we can borrow Winston Churchill's words to describe this utter basket case: \"A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\"\nBarry Ferguson harbours ambitions of taking on the Rangers managerial position on a permanent basis\nRangers were combative on Sunday, as predicted. They were fired up and, at times, threatening. Nothing about that was surprising. They scored first. Again, it wasn't a shock-horror moment. They've now taken the lead in four Old Firm games in a row.\nThe puzzle about how they can look pretty coherent in these games and look so bereft in others remains unsolved. Yes, they have more freedom to play when up against strong opposition who don't resort to the low block to frustrate them, but that only goes a certain part of the way in explaining the vast disparity in performances.\nHow can you go toe-to-toe with the likely Europa League finalists Spurs and Manchester United  - scoring in both, drawing one and losing the other to a late, late goal - and yet fall in a goalless heap against teams with a fraction of your playing resources and questionable defensive records?\nAt their worst this season, Rangers have lacked nous, steel, pace, leadership, creativity, goals from midfield, apart from Vaclav Cerny, and goals from a striker other than Dessers.\nAll four of Celtic's starting defenders on Sunday have scored more times this season than Conor Barron, who's on zero. Liam Scales, a centre-half, has as many as Nico Raskin, a defensive midfielder.\nOf the XIs who began at Ibrox, Rangers had two players in double figures for the season, Celtic had five - and that was with Nicolas Kuhn injured and Kyogo Furuhashi sold. Luke McCowan, an unused substitute on the day, has scored more goals than seven of Rangers' outfield starters.\nDespite all of this, they can live with Celtic on any given day. They just can't live with the pressure of should-win and must-win games.\nWe're told none of this is lost on the prospective new owners. They know the team and its foibles, they know the Scottish landscape and who dominates it, they know the distance they must travel across some rocky terrain and they know every inch of progress is going to be hard-won.\nRangers are capable of flash-in-the-pan performances, like Sunday and the other ones that went before against Celtic, but there's an empty feeling, an irrelevance when you suspect their next slip is just days away.\nUnbeaten, but still bowed, Rangers folk will want to go to sleep now and wake only when the new owners are in and making the kind of profound change that's required.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "The Italian island immediately conjures up grand bougainvillea-draped villas and a whitewashed city centre, lined by luxury boutiques. But that's \u2013 literally \u2013 only half of the story.\n\"Bring water,\" they said when I announced I'd be hiking the Sentiero dei Fortini (Trail of Little Forts). \"There's nothing out there.\"\nThe six-kilometre cliffside path linking the remains of three 19th-Century Bourbon military outposts was my fourth hike on this craggy Mediterranean island. Somewhere along the rocky, wild rosemary-flocked path while dodging spiky prickly pears, I realised that I'd only seen one other human in two hours. And there were indeed no water sources, aside from a rustic fountain I'd encountered a kilometre back at Fort M\u00e8sola.\nMy Google Maps sputtered. I'd already got lost twice before noting that the ceramic path markers were low to the ground, cataloguing the area's flora and fauna \u2013 fig trees and wildflowers, wall lizards and falcons. The terrain faded from wilderness to sheer crags. Finally at the last fort, Fort Orrico, I could see straight down to the sea; a 30m death drop. The islands of Ischia and Procida loomed in the Gulf of Naples like the humps of petrified sea monsters. And I was completely alone at the island's edge; triumphant.\nThis is Capri. But perhaps not as you imagine it.\nTypically, the word Capri conjures up bougainvillea-draped villas and luxury boutique-lined streets; a yacht dock for the glitterati and the perpetual artists' muse. Paul Feig's Another Simple Favor, which premiered on 1 May on Prime Video, is the latest film set against the island's opulent hotel culture and majestic cliffs, and is sure to inspire a fresh slew of Capri travel dreams.\nBut in Capri, glamour is \u2013 literally \u2013 only half of the story.\nThe camel-humped Capri \u2013 one of Italy's three volcanic Phlegrean islands \u2013 is actually home to two distinct towns. At the eastern end lies the princess Capri Town where loafer-wearing VIPs sip espresso in Piazza Umberto I; the \u00a0faraglioni sea stacks winking in the distance. And at Capri's western end is her rugged little sister, the township of Anacapri; a sea cliff and prickly pear paradise where hiking boots replace stilettos and wild outdoorsy adventures trump wild nightlife.\nTip:\nWhile Anacapri remains the island's outdoorsy paradise, Capri Town does have a few woodsy experiences of its own. Just push past the tourists and strike out from Piazza Umberto I or Via Camerelle towards the Punta Tragara lookout and the passeggiata del Pizzolungo. This clifftop trek offers incredible views of the faraglioni, passing the Arco Naturale \u2013 a Neolithic arch \u2013 and the Grotta di Matermania, the site of pagan rituals to the Goddess Mitra. Reward yourself with lunch at Le Grottelle for rustic island dishes and mesmerising Gulf views.\nBut while Capri sees as many as 16,000 visitors a day \u2013 outnumbering the 12,900 full-time residents \u2013 the majority only visit Capri Town.\n\"There's two main reasons for this,\" surmises Camilla Formisano, copyeditor at Caprionline. \"Time and imagination. Seventy to 80% of visitors arrive on organised excursions from Naples, Sorrento or cruise ships. So they visit the most famous, easily accessible places from the port, like Piazza Umberto I.\"\nFormisano also believes that social media plays a part: \"People see the faraglioni and the piazza and think, 'I saw Capri'. Social media has condensed the island into a single postcard.\"\nSocial media is merely Capri Town's latest PR rep. Before becoming a premier Italian bucket list destination, Capri was a humble fishing island. It was settled by the Ancient Greeks, later becoming the seaside retreat of the Roman emperor Tiberius, who left grand villas in his wake. It wasn't until centuries later, when the Romantic poets and then Hollywood filmmakers turned their artistic eye on Capri Town, that it became a VIP haven. Today, visitors spill out from the ferry and throng the bus and funicular ticket booths to jockey for place in Piazza Umberto I, dodging motorised luggage carts and women in Instagrammable sundresses at every turn.\nMeanwhile, it's just a 15-minute bus ride to Anacapri, where respite from Capri Town's day-tripper crowds and inflated prices await.\n\"Anacapri isn't completely free of overtourism,\" admits Formisano, referencing the tourist crush at the Blue Grotto, Villa San Michele and the chairlift to Monte Solaro. \"But head west, through the Boffe [main] quarter towards the lighthouse and the Migliera [trail], and you'll find the island's heart.\"\nPlan your trip\nArrive:\u00a0Get to Anacapri via bus or taxi from Capri Town or Marina Grande. Download the ATC Go app to calculate bus routes and buy tickets.\nStay:\u00a0The Giardino dell\u2019Arte offers lovely rooms and a sprawling garden.\nEat:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Aumm Aumm Family-friendly restaurant serving excellent Neapolitan-style pizza.\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Il Riccio Sea Lounge Jumeirah Capri Palace's luxe beach restaurant at the Blue Grotto.\n\u2022\u00a0Ristorante La Zagara Restaurant inside a lemon grove. The neighbouring vinoteca offers gourmet aperitivi.\nAnacapri is crisscrossed by stone-walled paths that yield to sudden sea views; perfumed in springtime by blooming orange trees. The terrain is hilly; locals zip by me on scooters and dusty motorised three-wheeled buggies. One wrong turn and I find myself either wheezing up a steep incline or at the cliff's edge.\nDespite the divine aimlessness of wandering Anacapri on foot, its principal outdoor attractions are best reached with wheels. The ATC Capri Srl buses operate regularly between Piazza Vittoria, the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena, a craggy bay dominated by the island's rust-red 19th-Century lighthouse, where sunbathers splay themselves on the rocks or dive nose-first into the sea. Beach clubs are cut into the cliffs, the most beloved being da Antonio, a shack serving panini, gelato and an excellent crouton-and-aubergine panzanella salad. The upscale Lido del Faro features a pool and a full-service restaurant; I enjoy a bracing limoncello Spritz while watching the wild swimmers from above.\nBut Punta Carena is best known for its sunsets.\n\"It's the only place on Capri where the sun sets into the sea,\" says Formisano. \"Thanks to Capri's particular shape, Anacapri remains sun-kissed until sunset. Sunsets here are a special experience, casting a golden light that envelops the landscape.\"\nIt was Formisano who first directed me to the Trail of Little Forts. \"A must-see,\" she called it.\nTip:\nIf starting the Trail of Little Forts from the Blue Grotto, take the Anacapri-Grotta Azzurra bus from Piazza della Pace until the Orrico stop, then head to the Piazzetta di Orrico to start the trail. Allow approximately three hours to complete.\nThe medium-difficulty trail runs along Anacapri's western coast between the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena. It's possible to start the trail at either end, but most trekkers begin at the Blue Grotto.\n\"So you can walk calmly immersed in nature, have a swim in M\u00e8sola cove and get to the lighthouse by afternoon; just in time to enjoy an aperitif and the magnificent spectacle of the sunset over the sea,\" says Formisano.\nBack in the Boffe quarter, Piazza della Pace is the origin point for two other brilliant Anacapri hikes; the Migliera trail and Mount Solaro.\n\"The Migliera is a narrow road winding through the countryside,\" says Formisano. \"You'll come to a dramatic cliff overlook. Climb the ridge to the left; you'll get a really unique view of the faraglioni.\"\nHowever, the view from Mount Solaro \u2013 Capri's highest point \u2013 is arguably the island's most famous. The 13-minute chairlift up the 589m mountain provides unforgettable views of terraced vineyards with the Amalfi Coast winking in the distance.\nVertigo? Summit Mount Solaro on foot by following Via Axel Munthe to Via Salita per il Solaro, keeping an eye out for stray mountain goats.\nFor any Anacapri hike, wear trail shoes; not your new Capri leather sandals. Before setting off, \"stop at De Martino in Piazza Capri for an excellent panino\", advises Formisano.\nMost people reach Anacapri by bus, but if you're fit, consider tackling the 1.7km Scala Fenicia, a 921-step flight of stone stairs chiselled into the cliffs by the Ancient Greeks; allowing countless generations of hardy Capresi to travel between Capri and Anacapri.\n\"It's not for everyone,\" admits Pep Minichino, founder of the Gulf of Naples-based blog, Campanica. Nonetheless, he encourages visitors to \"embrace the experience! All you need is a Led Zeppelin anthem [in your head] for the energy to climb the famous zig-zag staircase.\"\nThe Scala Fenicia, which can be accessed from Marina Grande, leads straight up to Villa San Michele, the residence of the early 20th-Century Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. The sprawling mansion \u2013 built over Roman ruins, featuring grand sitting rooms and Neoclassical gardens \u2013 is Anacapri's most touristed museum. But I came to climb, and my heart rate thunders as I bypass the tourist hordes at Marina Grande to undertake the trek, surrounded by olive trees, terraced lemon groves and, finally at the top, the sea.\n\"La Scala Fenicia is also open at night, so you can go down step by step,\" says Minichino. \"Slowly. Aided in your descent by a cascade of lights and stars.\"\nBy far, Anacapri's most visited attraction is the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), famed for its magical blue phosphorescence. Chaotic overtourism has engulfed this natural phenomenon, and I am overwhelmed by the massive queue and dozens of tourist-packed boats bobbing outside the grotto. But, once inside, the azure-blue light is breathtaking, and I am comforted as the boat captain's serenade of O Sole Mio echoes through the cave.\nFormisano's hack: \"The best way to visit the Blue Grotto is to be on the entrance steps at 09:00, arriving by land from Anacapri, not by sea from Marina Grande,\" she says. \"This way you'll be first in line. You won't have to wait your turn on a rocking boat.\"\nBut to truly enjoy the seas of Anacapri, Formisano suggests doing as the Capresi do: \"Going down to the Blue Grotto, follow the signs for \"gradola\" to reach a small terrace overlooking the sea with an excellent restaurant, a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.\"\nMinichino agrees: \"The best swimming, diving and sunbathing in Anacapri.\"\n\"After a day of outdoor activities in Anacapri, the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in the town's authentic, peaceful atmosphere,\" says Formisano.\nMy B&B, Giardino dell'Arte, is no sumptuous 19th-Century Capri Town palazzo, but my tidy room is floored with blue and white ceramic tiles, and orange blossoms spill over the wooden door. The courtyard overlooks a garden and the innkeeper offers me homemade ravioli alla Caprese; round ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs.\nStrolling deeper into the Boffe quarter, I come upon La Casa Rossa, a bright red mansion built by the American colonel John Clay MacKowen in the early 20th Century; a quirky blend of architectural styles ranging from medieval to Middle Eastern. There are generational bakeries in leaf-shaded alleys where I buy fistfuls of sour cherry pastries and pizzette.\nBut the neighbourhood stunner is the Chiesa Monumentale di San Michele Arcangelo, a petite Baroque church with a show-stopping majolica floor in ochres and blues depicting the Fall of Eden. The tiles can only be viewed from strategically positioned wooden boards or from the balcony above. Wide-mouthed crocodiles, lions and hooved Biblical beasts leer up at me, Adam and Eve at the centre of the fray.\nIt's my favourite view island\u2026 until the rooftops.\nBecause Anacapri is still Capri, just off the Boffe quarter there are two opulent hotels; Jumeirah Capri Palace and the historic Hotel Caesar Augustus, a palatial structure dating to 1850 whose clifftop terrace seems to extend into the sea. I charm my way into both, and wind up on their rooftop bars as the sun sinks pink and purple into the Gulf of Naples, throwing Ischia and Procida into bas relief.

        "article_text": "Robots for training carers, sensors that monitor people as they sleep and an app that can detect if someone is in pain - could this be the future of care?\nThe care sector is increasingly using technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to look after the UK's ever-growing elderly population.\nDespite this, experts have urged people to consider the potential risks of an overreliance on AI in the industry.\n\"AI can only be part of the solution but not the whole solution,\" says Dr Caroline Green from the University of Oxford.\nMs Green, the director of research at the Institute for Ethics in AI, spoke at an AI in Social Care Summit at the university in March.\nShe highlighted how AI systems could be susceptible to biases, which amplify discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping and has also recognised the worries people have around sharing their personal data with the technology.\n\"At the moment there's no official government policy on guidance on the use of AI in social care,\" Ms Green added.\nShe said: \"Whether it's going to be good for people who need support, depends on how policy is going to shape up here, it depends on what choices people will continue to have in the future, or whether they can for example opt out of having AI in their care at all, it will depend on whether there is going to be a sense in which AI technology can take over care provision and human interaction. \n\"We need to be very careful here on what choices people will have in the future and what the future of social care with AI will look like.\"\nThomas Tredinnick is the boss of AllyCares that uses sensors to monitor care home residents' rooms overnight, listening out for anything out of the ordinary.\nIt sends an audio recording of any incidents to carers on shift, who can then decide how to act.\nSpeaking from Oaklands Rest Home in Southampton, which uses the technology, Mr Tredinnick said it saves staff having to perform regular nightly checks, meaning residents can get a better sleep.\n\"The care staff are providing care to the residents that need it,\" he said.\nHe claims it has helped to reduce preventable health events leading to hospital admissions, as it spots things like falls and chest infections before they escalate.\nChristine Herbert said her 99-year-old mother Betty is one of the residents being monitored by the technology.\nShe admitted she was uncertain about the use of AI at first, comparing the technology to a \"baby monitor\".\n\"When mum came here for the first few nights I did ask for routine checks because I was concerned,\" she said.\nMrs Herbert said she came around to the technology after the home presented her with data which showed how her mother was monitored and not disturbed during the night.\nAt Elmbrook Court care home in Wantage, Oxfordshire, they are using AI to find out if residents are in pain.\nAislinn Mullee, deputy manager at the home, said: \"It can be quite difficult to identify pain in a resident that is non-verbal.\"\nUsing a smartphone app called Painchek, carers scan a resident's face for pain indicators, answer questions about the resident and then receive an instant percentage score which indicates the level of pain that person is feeling.\nMs Mullee said it has made a \"huge difference\" and they have used the information in collaboration with local GPs to assess which pain medication a resident requires.\nShe added it has also been used to reassure family members that a loved one receiving end-of-life care was not in pain.\nMs Mullee made clear the data gathered was password-protected and only visible to staff at the home.\nAt the University of Oxford's Robotics Institute they are hoping AI could also be used to train carers.\nMarco Pontin, a Post Doctoral Research Assistant, is part of a team which has created a robot which reacts to human touch.\nIt can be programmed to feel pain in different parts of its body and will physically flinch if a carer is too forceful when touching a painful area.\nIt will be trialled with students studying to be occupational therapists at Oxford Brookes University.\nMr Pontin said the team hoped to use it as a \"digital twin\" of real life patients.\nIt will be programmed with the same conditions as a human patient so that carers \"can replicate whatever they have seen in the real world but with the robot counterpart\".\nHe said: \"With an ever-growing ageing population it's harder to be there for everyone, so providing a digital twin of a patient could enable occupational therapists to know what is going on with their various patients without necessarily being there all of the time.\" \nPeople are living longer and there are an estimated 12 million people in the UK aged 67 or over, with that figure projected to rise to 13.7m by 2032.\nA report published by the House of Commons library in March stated in 2023/24, local authorities in England spent \u00a323.3bn on adult social care, which was the second biggest area of council spending after education.\nThe sector's reliance on workers from overseas is another big issue.\nHome Office statistics showed 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care, in the 12 months to December 2024.\nThis was a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules.\n\"We're reliant on migrant workers to keep social care going at the moment,\" says Lee-Ann Fenge, professor of social care at Bournemouth University.\nShe said she does not believe new technology should be used as a way of filling the gaps in the sector.\nShe said \"It needs to be seen as a tool that enhances the work that is already happening.\"\nShe added time needed to be taken to \"think about some of the ethical challenges\" that monitoring people could have.\n\"We need to prepare people better to protect themselves, so this isn't just about saying AI is wonderful, let's use it. We need to look at both the potentials of AI but also the risks that it could pose,\" she said.\nIn February, the UK and US governments refused to sign an international AI declaration in Paris, which pledged an \"open\", \"inclusive\" and \"ethical\" approach to the technology's development.\nThis comes as the government announced in March it will take a \"test and learn\" approach to funding AI in the public sector, in order to \"push innovation\".\nWhen catching up with Dr Caroline Green again she continues to promote a cautious approach to AI.\n\"It can help with some of the administrative work, some of the operation of care, but it cannot replace that human touch,\" she said.\n\"There is a potential risk that AI is going to be seen as a panacea to some of those very big problems that we are seeing in social care provision, namely that we don't have enough staff, and that there is a growing demand from an ageing population.\n\"I think here we really need to make sure that we don't just invest in AI to take over care-giving but that we keep on investing in people, in professionals who will be able to provide that care.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \"We will harness cutting-edge technology to transform social care and we are already seeing promising developments across the sector - from AI-powered fall detection systems that provide earlier interventions, to tools which automate paperwork to free up staff to focus on caring for people.\n\"Making better use of AI in social care is exactly the kind of transformation we're championing in our 10 Year Health Plan \u2013 shifting from treating sickness to preventing it, from hospital to community care, and from analogue to digital solutions.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and it is currently operating as a successful tourist site.\n\"Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,\" Trump wrote.\nThe prison would \"house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders\".\nPresident Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members there. He has also talked about sending \"homegrown criminals\" to foreign prisons. \nAlcatraz was originally a naval defence fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison. The Department of Justice took it over in the 1930s and it began taking in convicts from the federal prison system. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. \nThe prison was also made famous by the 1962 film, Birdman of Alcatraz, starring Burt Lancaster, about the convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who while serving a life sentence on the prison island developed an interest in birds and went on to become an expert ornithologist. \nIn 1979, the American biographical prison drama Escape from Alcatraz recounted a 1962 prisoner escape with Clint Eastwood starring as ringleader Frank Morris.\nIt was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz island. \nThe prison closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison website. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, largely due to its island location. \nIt would take an enormous amount of money to make Alcatraz into a functioning prison, Professor Gabriel Jack Chin from the Davis School of Law at the University of California told the BBC.  \nThe federal prison system is actually down about 25% from its peak population and \"there are a lot of empty beds\" in existing prisons, Chin said. \"So its not clear if a new one is needed.\"\nAlcatraz has \"a reputation as a tough prison\" and Trump is trying to send a message that his administration will be tough on crime, Chin added. \nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, said the proposal was \"not a serious one,\"  while the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, Scott Wiener, called the idea \"deeply unhinged\" in a post on Instagram and \"an attack on the rule of law.\"",

Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand.

When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border.

        "article_text": "A judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol foreign students.\nThe ruling came after Harvard filed a lawsuit - the latest escalation of a dispute between the White House and one of America's most prestigious institutions. \nThe university said the administration's decision on Thursday to bar international students was a \"blatant violation\" of the law and free speech rights.\nThe Trump administration says Harvard has not done enough to fight antisemitism, and change its hiring and admissions practices \u2013 allegations that the university has strongly denied.\nUS District Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order in a short ruling issued on Friday. \nThe order pauses a move that the Department of Homeland Security made on Thursday to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) - a government database that manages foreign students.\nThe next hearing will occur on 29 May in Boston.\n\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard argued in the lawsuit.\n\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Harvard President Alan Garber said in a letter.\n\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he wrote.\nIn response, White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said: \"If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with. \nAfter the restraining order was issued, Ms Jackson accused the judge in the case of having a \"liberal agenda\". \n\"These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy,\" she said. \nIt was quiet at Harvard on Friday. Classes have finished for the year and preparations are being made for commencements. Gazebos were going up on the quad as students rented their gowns and collected tickets for family members. \nFor those graduating, it should be a week of celebration. But for foreign students hoping to remain in the US, it's been a 24-hour whirlwind.\nAll morning Harvard's international student body scrambled to find out what was going to happen. Would they have to leave the US immediately? Were they now under the threat of deportation?\nCormac Savage from Downpatrick in Co Down Northern Ireland is six days from graduating with a degree in government and languages. He's taking a job in Brussels, partly because of the uncertainty in the US.\n\"You know that you're fine if you're still legally in the United States for the next 90 days, but you don't know that you can come back and finish your degree,\" he said on Friday. \"You don't know if you can stay and work in the US if you're about to graduate.\nThe order also complicates plans for students still enroled, like Rohan Battula, a junior from the UK who will rely on his visa to work in New York in June.\n\"I was worried if I went home I wouldn't get to come back,\" he told BBC, so he opted to stay on campus. \nFor a group of international students gathered on the banks of the Charles River, as rowing teams sculled by, the relief was palpable when news came in of the reprieve from the Boston court.\nMr Battula also felt relieved after Judge Burroughs issued her order. But the uncertainty still is taking a toll. \n\"It's surreal to think that even for some period of time you're unlawfully staying in a country, just because you've been to university there,\" Mr Battula said.\nThere are around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolled students this year.\nAround a fifth of them are from China, with significant numbers from Canada, India, South Korea and the UK. Among the international students currently enrolled is the future queen of Belgium, 23-year-old Princess Elisabeth. \nLeo Ackerman was set to study education and entrepreneurship at Harvard beginning in August, fulfilling a \"dream\".\n\"I was really excited, and I'm still really excited if I manage to go there,\" Mr Ackerman said. \"Having it taken away feels like a really sad moment for a lot of people.\"\nEliminating foreign students would take a large bite out of Harvard's finances. Experts say international students are more likely to pay full tuition, essentially subsidising aid for American students. \nUndergraduate tuition - not including fees, housing, books, food or health insurance - will reach $59,320 (\u00a343,850) in the coming academic year, according to the university. The total cost of a year at Harvard before any financial aid is usually significantly more than $100,000.\nIsaac Bangura, a public administration student from Sierra Leone, moved to  Harvard with his wife and two young daughters after surviving a civil war.\n\"Since yesterday, my kids has been asking, 'Daddy, I understand they are coming to return us home again.' They are referring to deportation,\" he said.\nHe said he has to be strong for them and has faith. \"I know the American people are always, whenever they are into issues, they will find ways of resolving it,\" he said.\nIn addition to Harvard, the Trump administration has taken aim at other elite institutions, not only arguing that they should do more to clamp down on pro-Palestinian activists but also claiming they discriminate against conservative viewpoints.\nOn Friday, speaking from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said, \"Harvard is going to have to change its ways\" and suggested he is considering measures against more universities. \nIn April, the White House froze $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) in federal funding to Harvard, and Trump has threatened to remove the university's tax-exempt status, a standard designation for US educational institutions. \nThe funding freeze prompted an earlier Harvard lawsuit, also asking the courts to stop the administration's actions.\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said federal courts in Massachusetts and New England, where the initial stages of the case will play out, have consistently ruled against the Trump administration. \nBut the outcome may be less predictable in the US Supreme Court, where Harvard's case may end up. \n\"These are tough issues for Harvard, but they have the resources and they seem to have the will to fight,\" Mr Tobias said. \nHarvard leaders have made concessions to the White House - including dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who came under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives. \nBut it also enlisted several high-profile Republican lawyers, including Robert Hur, a former special counsel who investigated Joe Biden's retention of classified documents.\nForeign students currently attending Harvard have expressed worries that the row  could force them to transfer to another university or return home. Being logged on the SEVP system is a requirement for student visas and, if Harvard is blocked from the database, students could be found in violation and potentially face deportation. \nSeveral British students enrolled at Harvard, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity out of fear of immigration authorities, worried their US education could be cut short. \n\"I definitely think freedom of speech is a problem on campus, but it's being actively worked on... it was an absolute shock when yesterday's announcement happened,\" said one student\n\"There's a lot of anger, people feeling like we're being used as pawns in a game.\" \nWith reporting from Kayla Epstein in New York, Bernd Debusmann at the White House and the BBC's User Generated Content team\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.\n\"Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,\" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. \n\"But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.\"\nShe had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. \nMoving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.\nLovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.\n\"Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,\" Lovina jokes. \"I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.\"\nSo she posted an open message on her Facebook account: \"Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?\"\nTo her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.\nShe quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.\n\"I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,\" she says. \"I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.\"\nLovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. \nAccording to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. \nIndians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.\nFollowing that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. \nShortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.\nLovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupra\u2060, Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. \nThey say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.\nThe community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. \nThey say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. \nA member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.\n\"The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,\" she says.\nBeyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. \nIn one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. \nNishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.\n\"The group was her first port of call,\" says Nishi. \"As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.\"\nAnother woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.\n\"I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,\" Priya says.\n\"Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused.\" \nSo she asked the group and they offered advice.\nPriya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.\n\"The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,\" says Priya. \"I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.\"\nThere has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. \nLovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.\n\"I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,\" says Lovina.\n\"I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.\"\nLovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. \nIt has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation.\nThe World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority.\nThe members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.\n\"We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,\" says Lovina. \"I think that's the biggest support system for us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Tom Cleverley played for Watford from 2017 to 2023 before moving into coaching\nWatford have sacked head coach Tom Cleverley after the team failed to reach the Championship play-offs.\nThe Hornets finished 14th in the table after taking only one point from their last five games - a 1-1 season-ending draw with Sheffield Wednesday.\nFormer Manchester United, Everton and Watford midfielder Cleverley, capped 13 times by England, was appointed as interim boss in March 2024 following Valerien Ismael's departure.\nHe was then confirmed in the post on a permanent basis the following month.\nThe 35-year-old was in charge for 60 games in total, winning 20 and losing 26.\nSporting director Gian Luca Nani said: \"The time has come for a change and to build on what we believe is a young and talented squad that will have benefited from the experience of the Championship this season.\n\"It has been a privilege to work closely with Tom; to understand how he sees the game and his enthusiasm for everything here. He deserves to be recognised for this and I'm sure he will have a bright future in the game.\"\nThe Hornets are now looking for their 10th permanent head coach since Nigel Pearson was sacked in the summer of 2020 with the club facing relegation from the Premier League.\nCleverley was the first head coach to remain in charge for an entire season since Javi Gracia in 2018-19.\nHe was unbeaten at home in his first 15 league games as boss, but results took a downturn following a 2-1 defeat by Cardiff on 29 December and they only took five points from the next nine matches.\nReports in Spain earlier this season claimed former Villarreal head coach Jose Rojo Martin, known as Pacheta, had been in talks with Watford to replace him.\nIn January, the club dismissed that as \"pure speculation\" and owner Gino Pozzo later said of Cleverley: \"We are committed to support him and look forward to the challenges ahead together.\"\nSpeaking last week, Cleverley said that hopes of achieving a play-off place had been undermined by injuries, particularly among his forwards.\n\"There's no difference in the number of goals we've conceded from pre-January to post-January, but the amount of goals we've scored has dropped significantly,\" he said.\nHe promised to learn the lessons of the campaign and added: \"We spent 10 weeks in the play-offs [places], we showed real positive signs before the turn of the year and I think we can clearly identify where and why we've run out of a bit of steam.\n\"We've got an incredibly young squad, the average age is boosted up by one or two individuals, but apart from that it's largely under 25 and the majority under 21 at the minute.\n\"The experiences they will have had this year - some bad ones - to really develop and ultimately improve from is one of the really exciting positives from this season.\"\nNo Watford manager or head coach has lasted an entire calendar year in the job since Malky Mackay in 2010.\nSince being relegated from the Premier League in 2022, they have finished 11th, 15th and now 14th.\n\"There will be no further club comment until a new appointment has been made,\" a statement on the Hornets website said.\nTom Cleverley made 146 appearances for Watford as a player\nBy Geoff Doyle, BBC Three Counties Radio sport editor\nThis is going to go down very badly with Watford fans. Tom Cleverley was a really popular head coach \u2013 probably the most popular since Javi Gracia who took the club to a Wembley FA Cup final - and supporters will be upset and angry. \nCleverley was a former player who first joined the club when he was a youngster on loan from Manchester United and then came back towards the end of his career. He then became academy manager at the club before his role as first-team head coach. \nWatford were seen as possible relegation candidates this season but Cleverley had them in and around the play-offs all season before they drifted away. \nHe also had to go through a seriously awkward situation in January where his club had to reassure him he wasn't being sacked on the day of a game when reports in Spain suggested the club had a new man lined up. \nThe Watford board feel like it's the right time for change and can point to a poor run of form in the last four months. But Watford fans' favourite song this season has been about not caring about owner Gino Pozzo and only caring about Cleverley. \nThis news isn't going to help relations between the owner and supporters.",

Tom Cleverley was a really popular head coach \u2013 probably the most popular since Javi Gracia who took the club to a Wembley FA Cup final - and supporters will be upset and angry. \"There will be no further club comment until a new appointment has been made,\" a statement on the Hornets website said.Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Tom Cleverley made 146 appearances for Watford as a player'Supporters will be upset and angry' - analysisBy Geoff Doyle, BBC Three Counties Radio sport editorThis is going to go down very badly with Watford fans.

So it's hugely significant.\"\nIn Wales, it is an offence to release beavers into open rivers without a licence, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said no licences of this type had been issued.\nIn England, where the government recently approved beavers' reintroduction to the wild, it is thought that there are about 500 of them - some in the wild and others in enclosures.\nIn Scotland, which began reintroducing beavers to the wild several years ago, it is thought that there are now more than 1,500.\n\"We had information that a beaver had been seen on this section of the River Dyfi, and we were told to get to this particular site at 18:00 and the beaver will be there,\" said Williams.\n\"We had gone out a few days before, and it poured with rain and we'd seen nothing.\n\"And I must admit, I was thinking, we're not going to get it. \n\"But then when we went on the first dry day, 18:00, and the beaver was there.\"\nWilliams said the beaver \"didn't pay us any attention at all\".\n\"It was very chill,\" he added.\n\"We were on the opposite bank, and we thought we better be quiet, don't move around. And the beaver just saw us and it just carried on feeding and swam.\"\nLocal people have reported seeing the beaver, and others, on the same stretch of the River Dyfi multiple times in recent years.\nBut exactly where they have come from remains a mystery, after a nearby beaver enclosure ruled out any escapes.\nAlicia Leow-Dyke, from Wildlife Trust Wales, said there was evidence of the semi-aquatic animals breeding along the waterway.\n\"On this occasion we know it's one family. It could be two families - one family split into two,\" she said.\n\"There has been evidence of breeding on the river. Youngsters have been spotted on the river over the years.\n\"Beavers only breed once a year and their litters are pretty small - two to three within a litter. So a beaver family could be anything from two adults, to five or eight if you include the young.\"\nLast year the Welsh government said it was considering introducing legislation to protect beavers, as wildlife charities called for them to be released into Wales' rivers.\nDr Robert Needham, from the Beaver Trust, said their reintroduction could bring substantial benefits, describing them as \"ecosystem engineer[s]\".\n\"What this means is that the sort of habitat modification that beavers can do through damming, building lodges, digging canals - this can create habitats for other species, and they can increase biodiversity,\" said Dr Needham.\n\"They can help restore our wetland habitats, which are massively lost throughout Europe, let alone Great Britain.\n\"They can help alleviate flooding with the dams that they create, particularly in headwater streams, they hold that water back, releasing it slowly. So we see a reduction in peak flow events, during storm events. But this can also be really beneficial to villages and society during summer periods, during drought conditions.\"\nBut not everyone believes that reintroducing beavers to the wild is a good thing. \nCritics say their dams can flood and waterlog fields while the animals themselves can feed on certain agricultural crops and damage trees.\n\"Fundamentally, there are issues. There are cases where river banks will fall in and the impact of flooding, particularly on good farmland as well,\" said Aled Jones, president of NFU Cymru.\n\"The management [of beavers] is crucial. We can't allow an indiscriminate approach where farming businesses are severely impacted. \n\"So we have to have control measures because this is their livelihoods. And we have to remember this is where farmers make their living, and anything negatively impacting that, if they're losing their crops because of flooding, who pays?\"\nIolo's River Valleys will be broadcast on BBC Two and BBC One Wales on 6 May at 19:00 and will also be available on BBC iPlayer.\nSign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

        "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.\nThe recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\n\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\n\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.\nIndia and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. \nThe LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. \nCeasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)\nThe LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". \nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. \nNot surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\n\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.\nViolence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.\nThe 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.\nBetween 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \n\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.\nTensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\n\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.\nMr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\n\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.\nMr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.\nHe argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \nThe hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.\nSome experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\n\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"\nIn his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \n\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.\nToday, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\n\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.\nIt was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",

        "article_text": "In 2010, Indian filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan made a striking debut at Cannes with Masaan -  a poignant tale of love, loss, and the oppressive grip of the caste system, set against the holy city of Varanasi.\nThe main lead in the film (Vicky Kaushal) performed a job assigned to one of the lowest castes in the rigid Hindu caste hierarchy \u2013 cremating dead bodies along the Ganges. Masaan played in the \"Un Certain Regard\" section at the festival, which looks at films with unusual styles and or that tells non-traditional stories. It won the FIPRESCI and the Avenir - also known as the Promising Future Prize - prizes.\nSince then, Ghaywan was in search of a story about India's marginalised communities. Five years ago in the middle of the pandemic, a friend, Somen Mishra - the head of creative development at Dharma Productions in Mumbai - recommended an opinion piece called Taking Amrit Home, published in The New York Times. It was written by the journalist Basharat Peer. \nWhat drew Ghaywan to Peer's article was that it tracked the journeys - sometimes of hundreds or even thousands of miles - taken by millions of Indians who travelled on foot to get home during the nation's strict lockdown during the pandemic. But he was also drawn to the core of the story, which focused on the childhood friendship between two men \u2013 one Muslim and the other Dalit (formerly known as the untouchables).\nGhaywan's new film Homebound, inspired by Peer's article, premiered at Cannes Film Festival's \"Un Certain Regard\" section this week, ending with a nine-minute long standing ovation. \n\nMany in the audience were seen wiping away tears. Ghaywan gave the lead producer Karan Johar a tight hug, while he and his young lead actors \u2013 Ishan Khatter, Vishal Jethwa and Janhvi Kapoor - came together in a larger group hug later. \nSince this was the biggest South Asian event at Cannes 2025, other film luminaries showed up to support the screening. India's Mira Nair (who won the Camera d'Or in 1988 for Salaam Bombay) leaned across two rows of seats to reach out to Johar. Pakistan's Siam Sadiq (who won the Un Certain Regard Jury Prize in 2022 for Joyland) was seen making a reel of the mood inside the theatre that he later posted on Instagram.\nThe film also received backing from a rather unexpected quarter. Its main producer is Johar, the leading Indian commercial filmmaker (known for blockbuster films like Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham and the recent Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani). But last month Martin Scorsese stepped in as the executive producer after he was introduced to the film by the French producer M\u00e9lita Toscan du Plantier.\nThis is the first time Scorsese has stepped in to support a contemporary Indian film. Until now he has only backed restored classic Indian films. \n\"I have seen Neeraj's first film Masaan in 2015 and I loved it, so when M\u00e9lita Toscan du Plantier sent me the project of his second film, I was curious,\" Scorsese said in a statement last month. \n\"I loved the story, the culture and was willing to help. Neeraj has made a beautifully crafted film that's a significant contribution to Indian cinema.\"\nAccording to Ghaywan, Scorsese helped nurture the film by mentoring the team through a number of rounds of edits. But he also tried to understand the cultural context which helped the exchange of ideas.\nThe context was important to Ghaywan, since he had been trying to capture the right spirit of the subject he was tackling. \nThe film's two lead characters \u2013 Mohammed Shoaib Ali (Khatter) and Chandan Kumar (Jethwa) have shared histories \u2013 the weight of centuries of discrimination at the hand of upper caste Hindus, but also similar goals to rise above the barriers imposed on them - in this case by joining their state's police force.\nGhaywan has openly shared that he was born into a Dalit family - a reality that has cast a long shadow over his life, haunting him since childhood.  \nAs an adult, he went on to study business administration and then worked in a corporate job in Gurgaon outside the capital, Delhi. He said he never faced discrimination but was acutely aware of his position in the caste hierarchy and still lives with the weight of where he was born. \n\"I am the only acknowledged person from the community who is there behind and in the front of camera in all of Hindi cinema history. That is the kind of gap we are living with,\" he says.\nA majority of India lives in its villages, but Hindi filmmakers rarely talk about bringing the villages to their stories, says Ghaywan. What also offends him is that marginalised communities are only talked about as statistics. \n\"What if we pick one person out of that statistic and see what happened in their lives?\" he says. \"How did they get to this point? I felt it was worth narrating a story.\"\nWhen he sat down to write the script, he tried to fictionalise the backstories of the two protagonists until the point that they took the journey during Covid \u2013 which is the beginning of Peer's article.\nAs a child in Hyderabad, Ghaywan had a close Muslim friend, Asghar, so he felt deeply connected to Ali and Kumar's lived experiences in the film.\n\"What appealed to me more was the humanity behind it, the interpersonal, the interiority of the relationship,\" he says, that took him back to his childhood in Hyderabad.\nIn Ghaywan's hands, Homebound has the wonderful glow and warmth of the winter sun. It is gorgeously shot in India's rural North, capturing simple joys and the daily struggles of its Muslim and Dalit protagonists. The two men, the woman one of them loves (Kapoor and Jethwa both portray Dalit characters), and their interactions offer much to reflect on and understand.\nFor the most part, Ghaywan's script keeps viewers on the edge. Back in 2019, none of us truly grasped the scale of the coming pandemic - but the film subtly foreshadows a shift, reminding us that a crisis can cut across class, caste, and ethnicity, touching everyone.\nHomebound's seamless blend of fiction and reality has produced a powerful public document, grounding its characters in authenticity. More than just moving its audience to tears, the film is bound to spark meaningful conversations - and, one hopes, a deeper understanding of those who live in the shadows. ",

The post comes days after he joked to media: \"I'd like to be Pope.\"\nTrump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida. \nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.\nThe image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. \n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,\" the group wrote.\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.\"\nLeft-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. \n\"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. \nBut the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.\n\"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nThe backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.\n\"It wasn't good,\" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. \"I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.\"\nSwitching to Italian, he called it a \"brutta figura\", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.\nAsked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - \"who knows\" and declined to speak more about it.",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

        "article_text": "Bayern's 'James Bond' - how Kane clinched his first trophy\nFor all the goals and individual accolades, Harry Kane has long been hit with criticism - that he had never won a trophy with club or country.\n\"There are many people who, throughout my career, only talk about the fact I haven't won a title yet,\" the England captain said recently, as Bayern Munich's Bundesliga crown began to look more inevitable. \"It would be nice to silence a few of them.\"\nKane even saw the irony in the fact his 15-year wait for a senior trophy might end while he watched on from the stands as Bayern faced RB Leipzig on Saturday, having been handed a one-game suspension following his fifth yellow card of the season last week.\n\"It's kind of my story that I'll miss the Leipzig game,\" said the 31-year-old. \"But no worries, I'll celebrate more than anyone else.\"\nKane even made his way to the touchline ready to join the party until a stoppage-time Leipzig leveller meant the wait was delayed by a day when second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Freiburg on Sunday.\nThat saw Vincent Kompany's side secure the German title, and means Kane has finally put to rest the notion that a glittering individual career may finish without any silverware.\nThe striker had been following the Leverkusen game with fellow England international Eric Dier and the rest of their Bayern team-mates, and posted a video on social media of them singing \"we are the champions\" after the title was confirmed.\n\"What a night, and what a celebration with the players and staff,\" Kane said in a video posted to his social media channels.\n\"I'm sure everyone is feeling it a little bit this morning. But we are here and I feel amazing.\n\"It's been a long time coming. Obviously a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication. It just feels sweet to win the title and the first one of my career.\n\"I appreciate all the support as always, it never goes unnoticed and I can't wait to enjoy these next couple of weeks. I can't wait to be at Allianz Arena on Saturday to celebrate in front of the fans.\"\n\"I'm thrilled for him because he deserves it so much,\" former Bayern Munich and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jurgen Klinsmann told BBC Sport.\n\"He has proven it throughout the last 10 years. His numbers are absolutely insane and he will do that for another couple of years because he's in top shape still, he's fit, he's hungry.\n\"I'm really happy for him. I just love to watch him.\"\nHarry Kane's debut ended in defeat by RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup\nKane's career has not followed the trajectory one might expect for England's all-time record goalscorer. As an under-14s player at Tottenham, according to former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe, he \"wasn't even on the podium\" when it came to the age-group's top talents.\nHe was still a youth player the last time Spurs won a trophy, the League Cup in 2008, but earned his breakthrough with the first-team squad and signed his first professional deal in July 2010. Then there were hard-grafting loan spells with Leyton Orient in League One and in the Championship with Millwall and Leicester, as well as with Norwich in the Premier League.\nOnce Kane established himself at White Hart Lane, he blossomed into Spurs' best homegrown player of a generation, becoming the club's all-time top scorer with 280 goals in 435 games and climbing to second in the Premier League ranks with 213, behind only Alan Shearer's 260.\nYet for all the goals, and three Premier League Golden Boots, a decade in lilywhite yielded only a series of near-misses - a Champions League final defeat by Liverpool, twice runners-up in the League Cup and beaten to the title in successive seasons by Leicester and Chelsea.\nThat story repeated itself with England, as they were runners-up at the past two European Championships and beaten in the 2018 World Cup semi-final by Croatia, despite Kane winning the Golden Boot in Russia seven years ago and finishing as joint top-scorer at last summer's Euros.\n\"I always said that if Harry leaves Spurs, he will get the opportunity to win titles,\" added Klinsmann, who also won his only league championship after leaving Tottenham for Bayern in 1995.\nIndeed, trophies seemed like a foregone conclusion when Kane joined Bayern for an initial 100m euros (\u00a386.4m) in August 2023 - a club who had won 11 successive Bundesliga titles before his arrival.\nKane even had a shot at silverware on his debut, but Bayern lost 3-0 to RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup at Allianz Arena with the England captain coming off the bench for the final half hour.\nWas he cursed? When Bayern were then knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken, some may have believed so.\nLeverkusen ran away with the league as Bayern finished third, their lowest position since 2011, while Thomas Tuchel's side were beaten by eventual winners Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals.\n\"People made bad jokes about him,\" explained Taufig Khalil, commentator for ARD Radio.\n\"Bayern Munich won the German championship 11 years in a row, Harry Kane came for 100m-plus and the next season Bayern Munich did not win a single trophy!\n\"It was tough for him. He came to Munich because he knew this is the club where you can win trophies, where you will be on top. And then he came and it was a very bad season last year.\"\nHarry Kane enjoys Munich's Oktoberfest\nKane never wavered in his desire to keep improving after becoming the Bundesliga's record signing. He spoke recently about studying the game's greats and having the drive to consistently be one of the world's best.\nHe has dealt with the pressure of essentially replacing Robert Lewandowski, who left in 2022 as Bayern's second all-time scorer behind Gerd Muller.\n\"Bayern Munich has a huge tradition of number nines,\" explained Klinsmann.\n\"There is always a special eye on them. To fill that spot is just an honour. It's something very special. He knows that he is followed closely by everyone.\"\nAnd not just in Munich - Khalil said rival fans see it as a privilege to have Kane in Germany: \"When the captain of the Three Lions is playing in the Bundesliga - wow, that's big!\"\nYet there is no superstar ego on boy from east London.\nHe is regarded as incredibly professional and a leader among the squad - a player a lot of his younger team-mates look up to and someone who is very respectful, whether that be in training or completing the many media and partner obligations that come with representing a European giant like Bayern.\n\"He has a royal approach,\" added Khalil. \"When he enters the stadium, he greets everybody, he is very friendly. If there is a moment he doesn't want to talk in the mixed zone, then he excuses himself. A lot of other players walk through with headphones on or use the telephone and try not to look in the eyes of the media.\n\"Normally he stops, he is always ready to talk. He is an absolutely leading person in that club. He gives a lot of that James Bond gratitude - he is the striker with the licence to score!\"\nKane has thrown himself into life in Munich, embracing the culture, trips to Oktoberfest, visiting supporters' clubs and taking German lessons, even if he has previously joked his kids will learn the language before him.\n\"What he's done extremely well is adapt to Bavaria with so much ease,\" said Klinsmann. \"He became part of the lifestyle, the city and his family just fit into the way of life there.\n\"It's an international place, Munich, so it's not too problematic but still, you've got to go to another country and keep your work-rate at the highest level while figuring out that your family are comfortable and having a good time.\"\nHe is popular, too. Kane quickly struck up a friendship with Bayern's all-time leading appearance-maker Thomas Muller, who will leave at the end of the season, and is known to play golf with the Germany forward and midfielder Konrad Laimer, among others.\nNaturally, he is also good friends with former Spurs team-mate Eric Dier, another player well-liked throughout the squad, with both England internationals regarded as being important to team chemistry at Bayern.\n\"The people love him,\" added Klinsmann. \"He is just himself. He is humble and down to earth. He focuses on what is important and for him, that is scoring goals.\"\nEric Dier joined England team-mate Harry Kane at Bayern in January 2024\nAfter six final defeats - three with Spurs, two with England and one with Bayern - the humble yet ruthless goal-getter's perseverance has paid off.\nKane's first German title is Bayern Munich's 34th, but there can be no doubting the Englishman's importance to Kompany's side.\n\"It helps when you have a top player who wants to run and fight for the team like a youth player,\" said the former Manchester City and Belgium captain. \"I played against him as an opponent and he has become better with age.\"\nKane is the division's top scorer with 24 goals and has 36 in all competitions this season, having scored 11 in the Champions League.\nThat was a competition in which Bayern were desperate to reach the final at their home stadium in Munich, but Kane missed a big chance in the quarter-final first leg against Inter and, despite scoring in the return in Milan, they were knocked out.\n\"At the end, we talked with him and he said, 'yeah, everybody is right to expect me to make that goal, I didn't do it, that's fate,'\" said Khalil, shrugging off critics who suggest Kane does not score in \"big games\".\n\"Whenever there are bad moments, after the match, in the mixed zone, Harry walks through and he stops, he is talking, he accepts the situation.\"\nBayern were also knocked out of the German Cup by Leverkusen, but in the Bundesliga - bar a brief wobble in March when they lost at home to lowly Bochum - Kompany's side, with Kane at its heart, have led from the front.\nHis form during this title run is a continuation of what began in his debut season, where he netted 36 times - only Gerd Muller and Lewandowski have scored more in a single Bundesliga campaign.\n\"The team clicks well with the players around him,\" said Klinsmann. \"He plays in a system that he's getting fed by attacking midfielders.\n\"He's extremely important to the Bayern side and he's done a fantastic job from day one.\"\nIn April, he became the fastest player to hit 60 goals in the competition, doing so in 60 appearances to break Erling Haaland's record by five games. He also registered 15 assists in that time to average a goal involvement every 72 minutes.\n\"He fights, he works, he scores an incredible number of goals,\" added Bayern's honorary president Uli Hoeness. \"No-one deserves it more than him.\"\nHarry Kane reached 60 Bundesliga goals in as many games, the fastest player to do so\nKhalil believes more trophies will follow for Kane, and Bayern's focus will soon switch to winning the Fifa Club World Cup in the United States this summer. \n\"The moment Bayern Munich went out of the Champions League, they started to talk about the Club World Cup,\" he said. \"It's another big trophy, an international trophy, and they would make a lot of money.\"\nThat could play a role in Kane's future and whether Bayern can afford to add widely linked, but expensive, target Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen.\n\"Everybody wants him to stay,\" said Khalil, with Kane's contract running until 2027.\n\"The question is, would Florian Wirtz together with Jamal Musiala, the two German youngsters playing side by side, work with a central box striker and how much money do you want to spend on Harry Kane for next season?\n\"For me, that's stupid, I definitely see him next year in the Bundesliga. They have to find another way to finance Florian Wirtz.\n\"I think we will see Harry Kane for at least another year.\"\nAdditional reporting by Charlotte Coates.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. \nThe picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff. \nThe New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: \"I'd like to be Pope.\"\nTrump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida. \nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.\nThe image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. \n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,\" the group wrote.\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.\"\nLeft-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. \n\"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. \nBut the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.\n\"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nThe backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.\n\"It wasn't good,\" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. \"I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.\"\nSwitching to Italian, he called it a \"brutta figura\", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.\nAsked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - \"who knows\" and declined to speak more about it.",

        "article_text": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.\nThis is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.\nAt the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to estimate that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.\nThe BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.\nSo far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.\n20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.\nAmong the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.\nThey had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.\nBairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.\nIn February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.\nOkhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.\nUnlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.\nIn total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.\nA few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.\nThere was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.\nA relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"\nIn our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.\nIn the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.\nIn 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.\nIn the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.\nIn 2023, the number rose to 37,633.\nIn 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.\nIn August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.\nHowever, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.\n\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.\nAfter almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.\nAccording to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.\nEven then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.\nThe cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.\nActual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.\nOverall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land. \nIf we assume that our figure of 45,287 confirmed deaths in 2024 is about 40% of the full number, then the total number would be closer to 112,000 fatalities last year.\nThis means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.\nRussia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.\n\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.\nOne-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.\nWe also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.\nVolunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.\nIn 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.\nOne Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.\nThe one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).\nCalculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.\nThis is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.\nThe true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.\nAn assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.\nThat would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.\nCLARIFICATION 5 May 2025: This story has been updated to make it clear that the figure of 27 losses per sq km is based on an estimated number of deaths last year of about 112,000.",

        "article_text": "On 12 June 1962, three men escaped from Alcatraz, never to be seen again. The ultimate fate of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers remains a mystery but the ingenuity and determination of their daring escape \u2013 from what was the US's most secure prison \u2013 continues to captivate. Two years later, the BBC returned to the scene of the crime.\nIn May 1964, BBC Panorama's Michael Charlton made \"the most feared journey in the criminal world\" across the churning waters of San Francisco Bay to see the infamous prison island of Alcatraz. Nicknamed \"the Rock\", the federal penitentiary had held some of the most dangerous criminals in the US. It was regarded as an impregnable fortress. But in the early hours of 12 June 1962, three men achieved what was thought impossible: they escaped.\nIn the news\nOn 4 May, US president Donald Trump said, in a post on his Truth Social site, that he would call for the reopening of Alcatraz, the once-notorious island prison which now serves as a tourist site in the San Francisco Bay. He wrote that it would become \"a symbol of law, order and justice\". Read more by BBC News's Gabriela Pomeroy, here.\nAlcatraz had originally been a naval defence fort to protect the entrance to the bay. During the US Civil War, because of the island's isolation, steep cliffs and the swift, cold currents that surrounded it, captured Confederate prisoners were held there. Early in the 20th Century it was rebuilt as a military prison. In the 1930s, as the US tried to deal with rampant organised crime that flourished during Prohibition, the Department of Justice took it over. Soon the most fearsome convicts from the federal prison system began arriving. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, as well as convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who would later become better known as the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\". \"Men too vicious and troublesome to be held in an ordinary jail,\" was the way the BBC's Charlton put it.\nFour years before Panorama travelled there, Frank Lee Morris had arrived on the island. Orphaned at the age of 11, and convicted of his first crime by the age of 13, Morris had spent most of his life in and out of various correctional facilities. Considered highly intelligent, he was a seasoned criminal, with a charge sheet ranging from drug possession to armed robbery and, perhaps most notably, prison breaks. He had been sent to the Rock in January 1960 following his escape from Louisiana State Penitentiary. As soon as he arrived on Alcatraz, he began to think about how he would leave. He was joined in his cell block by convicted bank-robbing brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Allen West, who had been an inmate on Alcatraz since 1957. All the men knew each other from previous stints in prisons together, and since they had adjoining jail cells, they were able to speak to each other at night.\nWhen the BBC's Charlton visited the site, a year after its closure, he was well aware of the prison's formidable reputation for unrelenting guards, harsh conditions and the punishing sea winds that the convicts had to endure. \"A relentless wind which never seems to stop, howls and echoes through the bars,\" he said. \"Built over the rambling passages of an old fort\u2026 the foundations today of Alcatraz are rotting and breaking up.\"\nWith Morris taking the lead, the four prisoners began to concoct an elaborate and audacious plan to escape. Over a period of several months, the men chiselled away at the salt-damaged concrete around the air vent under their sinks. Using metal spoons purloined from the dining hall, a drill made from a vacuum-cleaner motor and discarded saw blades, they dug through to an unguarded utility corridor. To mask the noise of the drill, Morris would play his accordion during the daily hour set aside when music was played to the prisoners. Once they had created a hole large enough to crawl through to the corridor, they climbed up to the empty top level of the cellblock and set up a secret workshop. To hide the cell-wall holes, they fashioned fake papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 grills from prison library magazines. Once they were in their workshop, they set about constructing a 6x14ft makeshift rubber raft and life-vests made from more than 50 stolen raincoats. To seal the rubber, they melted it using the prison's hot steam pipes. They then converted a concertina into a tool to inflate the raft and fashioned paddles out of bits of plywood.\nBut while they worked, they needed to conceal their absence from the guards who periodically made night-time checks. So, they sculpted papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 versions of their heads from soap, toothpaste and toilet paper. To make them look more realistic, they used real hair from the prison barbershop floor and painted them in flesh tones using stolen art supplies. These they would then place in their beds, with bundles of clothes and towels under their blankets in the shape of their bodies to make it look like they were asleep. As they worked on their makeshift escape gear, they were also looking for a way out. Using plumbing piping as steps, they climbed 30 feet (9.1m) and prised open the ventilator at the top of a shaft. They crafted a fake bolt out of soap to keep it in place.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How D-Day began with a death-defying mission\n\u2022 The US couple who survived the Alaskan wilderness\n\u2022 Britain's mysterious WW2 'island of death'\nFinally, on the night of 11 June 1962, they were ready to put their ingenious plan into motion. Leaving the dummy heads in their beds to fool the guards, Morris and the two Anglin brothers crawled out through the holes on the cell walls. West's escape was scuppered when he was unable to get out of his cell in time, so the others left without him. They climbed up to the cellhouse roof, ran across it\u00a0\u2013 carrying their makeshift boat, in sight of the guard tower\u00a0\u2013 shimmied down an outside drainpipe, crossed the prison yard, scaled two successive 12-ft (3.7m) barbed wire fences and scrambled down a steep embankment to the north-eastern shore of the island. At the water's edge, they inflated their boat and disappeared into the night. The alarm wasn't raised until the following morning, when the decoy heads were discovered.\nThe island was also home to the families of guards who worked at the prison. Jolene Babyak's father, who was acting warden at Alcatraz at the time, triggered the alarm. \"When I woke up, the siren was still going. It was very piercing, extremely loud, it was horrible, it was pretty scary,\" she told BBC Witness History in 2013. \"I was shocked you know, and my first thought was that can't be an escape attempt, and, of course, it was.\"\nThe prison went into immediate lockdown with an intensive search of all the buildings, including the prison officers' accommodation. Meanwhile Jolene's father launched a massive manhunt with hundreds of law enforcement personnel extensively searching the surrounding area for days. On 14 June, the Coast Guard found one of the prisoners' paddles. The same day, workers found a packet of the Anglins' personal effects, sealed in rubber. Seven days later some remnants of the raft were washed up near the Golden Gate Bridge and the following day one of the homemade life-vests was discovered. But the three fugitives were never seen again.\u00a0\nAlthough the prisoners escaped the prison, the authorities concluded they must have perished in treacherous waters attempting to leave the island. That was certainly the view of prison warden Richard Willard when the BBC interviewed him in 1964.\" Yes, we are short a few, but they are not bragging about it. In other words, that assumedly all those that we are short, drowned in the procedure. There is, to our knowledge, nobody walking the streets today bragging about having escaped from Alcatraz,\" he said. \"Why am I so sure? You hear the wind, don't you? And you see the water? Do you think you could make it?\"\nAlcatraz prison shut down in 1963, a year after the men's escape. Partly this was due to its deteriorating structure and the expense of running it but the prison's severe regime had also long been subject of controversy. As early as 1939, US Attorney General Frank Murphy had tried to close it down, saying: \"the whole institution is conducive to psychology that builds up a sinister and vicious attitude among the prisoners\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nOver the years, prisoners had killed or maimed themselves \u2013 unable to face the unrelenting conditions \u2013 and as the 1960s progressed, the US looked towards rehabilitation of inmates rather than just their punishment.\nAs for the three escapees, despite no bodies ever being found in the bay, in 1979 they were declared legally dead. The FBI closed its case and turned over responsibility to the US Marshals Service.\nBut speculation about their fate has never waned. The same year they were declared dead, the film Escape from Alcatraz was released with Clint Eastwood portraying Frank Morris. And from the moment of their escape in 1962, there were reports of alleged sightings of the men, and of messages from them.\u00a0\nIn 2018, San Francisco police revealed they had been sent a mysterious letter five years earlier, from someone claiming to be John Anglin. The letter read \"I escape from Alcatraz in June 1962. Yes we all made it that night, but barely!\" The letter maintained that the men had lived on in secret, with Frank Morris dying in October 2005, and Clarence Anglin in 2008. The letter's author said he now wanted to negotiate his surrender in exchange for cancer treatment. The FBI assessed the letter but were unable to verify if it was authentic or not.\nThe case is still open for the US Marshals Service. As recently as 2022, it released updated pictures of what the three missing Alcatraz prisoners might look like now, while appealing for any information about them, in the hope that finally it could put the mystery to bed.\u00a0\nThis article was originally published on 10 June 2024 and has been republished.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The UK and India have agreed a trade deal to make it cheaper and easier to buy and sell goods and services to one another.\nThe hope is that the deal will benefit the economies of both countries.\nThe British government said the deal was the \"biggest and most economically significant\" trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020.\nHere's a quick guide to what's been agreed and what it could mean for you.\nThe UK has lowered taxes on goods imported from India including:\nIndia has cut taxes on goods imported from the UK including: \nThe deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India.\nThe trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes.\nOver time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.\nThis deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers. \nFor example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. \nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.\nIt is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.\nHowever, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years.

        "summary": "Four things you need to know about UK-India trade deal12 hours agoShareSaveMichael Race & Jennifer MeierhansBusiness reporters, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesThe UK and India have agreed a trade deal to make it cheaper and easier to buy and sell goods and services to one another.The hope is that the deal will benefit the economies of both countries.The British government said the deal was the \"biggest and most economically significant\" trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020.Here's a quick guide to what's been agreed and what it could mean for you.What has been agreed?The UK has lowered taxes on goods imported from India including:clothing and footwearfood products including frozen prawnsjewellery and gemssome carsIndia has cut taxes on goods imported from the UK including: cosmeticsscotch whisky, gin and soft drinkshigher-value carsfood including lamb, salmon, chocolate and biscuitsmedical devicesaerospaceelectrical machineryThe deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India.What will be the impact on people in the UK and India?The trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes.Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.It is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.What does this mean for visas?One of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.The British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.But it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.This agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.The UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.Last year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India.",

        "article_text": "The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory \u2013 but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.\nThe latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called \"terrorist infrastructure\" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.\nMany of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.\nAfter India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.\nIndia reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance. \nIslamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.\n\"Losses are a part of combat,\" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets. \n\"We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,\" he added.\nIndia said it had killed at least \"100 terrorists\" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.\nA definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.\nA Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.\nSome of the experts have called this a \"DeepSeek moment\" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.\n\"The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,\" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.\nThe Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed \"China has some systems that are next to none\". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.\nOther experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.\nProfessor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.\n\"In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,\" he said.\nMr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.\nBeijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.\nCarlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.\n\"At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,\" she said.\nFor China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (\u00a337bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.\nSo, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.\nChina made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. \"It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,\" he said.\nExperts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.\nChina sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.\nReports said the Burmese military grounded several of its JF-17 fighter jets \u2013 jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 \u2013 due to technical malfunctions.\nThe Nigerian military reported several technical problems with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.\nAnother point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.\nIn 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later. \nIndia, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.\nDespite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an \"impressive breadth of targets\" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.\nThe Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.\nOne of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.\nMr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets. \nThe Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.\n\"It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,\" Mr Ladwig pointed out.\nNevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military \"lost control of the narrative thread\".\nIn response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.\nRealising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.\nBut for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.\nBeijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.\nDelhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.\nIndia and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.\nExperts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.\nFor now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. \nThe viscose yarn \u2013 a popular material that goes into making woven garments \u2013 he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month.\nThat's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; \u00a30.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports.\nWith Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets.\nIndia's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs.\nWhile China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps.\nMill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition.\n\"We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,\" he says.\nJagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are \"slowing production\". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.\nChina's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.\n\"We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,\" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.\nBut anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.\nWhile pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.\nTheir sudden inflow will prove \"very disruptive\" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.\nIn 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.\nIndia, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (\u00a375bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.\nIn response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.\nIndia also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.\nDespite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. \nThat's because the government has only had \"limited success\" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. \nWhile western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.\nIndia's burgeoning deficit is a \"worrying story\", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.\n\"This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,\" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. \n\"We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.\"\nIndia needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.\nAkash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being \"swamped by China\", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. \nWith fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.\nChina wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, \"It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny\".\nDespite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.\n\"This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Former Indianapolis 500 champion Marcus Ericsson hails from Sweden but calls Circle City home. Here are his top local recommendations ahead of the Indy 500.\nIndianapolis \u2013 known as the Crossroads of America for its critical role as a transportation hub during the US Civil War \u2013 has its fair share of attractions, from rugged outdoor experiences like the White River State Park to the public art installations scattered throughout its vibrant Mass Ave Cultural District.\nBut the Indiana state capital may be best known for its sports culture. While fans flock to the stands of Lucas Oil Stadium and Gainbridge Fieldhouse \u2013 home to the NFL's Indianapolis Colts and the NBA's Indiana Pacers, respectively\u2013 nowhere is the city's competitive spirit more electrifying than at the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which can hold up to 400,000 people. The crown jewel of the city's calendar is the\u00a0Indianapolis 500-Mile Race each May \u2013\u00a0a race that typically attracts 300,000 spectators. It's a tradition that unites generations of fans and defines the city's identity.\nThe Specialist\nSwedish native Marcus Ericsson currently competes in the NTT IndyCar Series with Andretti Global. He has won titles in British Formula BMW and Japanese Formula 3. Ericsson raced in Formula One from 2014 to 2018, primarily with Sauber. In 2019, he transitioned to IndyCar, winning the Indy 500 in 2022.\u00a0\n(Credit: Andretti Global/ Alex Frick)\nIn 2019, former Formula One driver Marcus Ericsson\u00a0relocated from his native Sweden to Indianapolis to fully immerse himself in the tight-knit and high-powered IndyCar community. In \"the Racing Capital of the World\", Ericsson fills his days with exercising, exploring, biking, running trails and dining at the city's internationally inspired restaurants.\n\"We have fun sports with the Pacers and the Colts, and obviously the IMS [Indiana Motor Speedway] and now the new museum [the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum] which is amazing,\" says Ericsson. \"There are a lot of fun little places, like restaurants and bars as well. It's a really cool city to live in.\"\nHe adds: \"People are very friendly and very open. So, for me, it felt like home very quickly.\"\nHere are Ericsson's favourite ways to experience Indianapolis.\u00a0\nIndianapolis has plenty of famous foods, like the spicy shrimp cocktail at St Elmo Steak House or the widely available pork tenderloin sandwich. For a sampling of Indianapolis' dining scene, Ericsson recommends exploring Massachusetts Avenue, a mile-long street running diagonally into downtown, lined with lively bars and restaurants. \"Ericsson and his wife love going out for dinner at Modita, an Asian fusion eatery. Located in the Bottleworks Hotel, an Art Deco boutique hotel that was once the country's largest Coca-Cola bottling plant, Modita's menu is infused with the same spirit of reinvention. Executive Chef Megan Stoller draws inspiration from several Asian food cultures to reimagine classic dishes like sushi and dim sum. Ericsson's recommendation: \"Get the bao buns, they're very, very good. I always get them every time I go.\"\u00a0\nIf you want to get out of the city centre, Ericsson suggests heading to Broad Ripple, an eclectic neighbourhood just north of downtown, where you can unwind over Neapolitan-style pizza at Diavola.\nWebsite: https://www.modita.com/\u00a0\nAddress: 850 Massachusetts Ave., Suite 110, Indianapolis, IN 46204\nPhone: 317-316-0470\nInstagram:\u00a0@modita.restaurant\n\n\"As a race car driver, I always have to stay active to be fit to drive. And that's a big part of my life. I need to be outdoors and be healthy,\" Ericsson says. \"One thing that I love about Indianapolis is that we have something called the Monon Trail, which is a trail from downtown Indianapolis all the way up to north of Indianapolis.\nTip\nIf you're attending the Indy 500, keep in mind that there's more to do than simply watch on race day. \"Something that's very famous with the Indianapolis 500 is called Carb Day (23 May this year), which is the last practice session that always runs on the Friday before the race,\" says Ericsson. \"There are always concerts on the track combined with the last practice, so it's like a big party.\"\u00a0\n\"You can jump on that trail from everywhere in the city. People spend a lot of time walking or cycling there, so it's always super busy and is a great way to stay active,\" says Ericsson.\u00a0\nThe trail began as a railroad line linking to Chicago and Louisville; today, it's a popular 41km biking and walking trail. Extending from the northern suburbs into the heart of Indianapolis, where it connects to the Indianapolis Cultural Trail and the north end of Massachusetts Avenue, the trail winds through the city's central neighbourhoods past popular wine bars and cafes.\nTo explore a little further out of the city, Ericsson ventures 20 minutes north of Indianapolis to Eagle Creek Park. \"Eagle Creek Park is the largest park in Indianapolis, and it has a reservoir and some pretty nice trails,\" he says. \"I go there in the summer, and you can rent a kayak or just walk around and get out in nature.\"\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.bikethemonon.com/\nEricsson's top pick for a wow-worthy night on the town is Vida, a chef-driven establishment housed in an unpretentious building just off Massachusetts Avenue. Helmed by Indiana native Chef Thomas Melvin \u2013\u00a0a 2024 James Beard Award semifinalist for Best Chef: Great Lakes \u2013 Vida is known for its multi-course menu of artfully plated dishes prepared with fresh, seasonal ingredients from local farms. Guests can observe the chefs in the open kitchen, which is framed by a hydroponic \"green wall\" that supplies fresh herbs. Ericsson says that because the menu changes almost daily, he never quite knows what to expect when dining there. But the ambiance and service remain the same, with the crackle of a double-sided fireplace casting a warm glow and the impressive wine vault inviting guests to sip something special.\u00a0\n\"My wife and I are kind of foodies, and when we travel, we always like trying fine dining restaurants. Vida reminds me of the high-end, Michelin-star restaurants that we go to internationally,\" says Ericsson.\u00a0 \"We usually go there for special occasions, like Valentine's Day or birthdays.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.vida-restaurant.com/\u00a0\nAddress: 601 E New York St, Indianapolis, IN 46202\nPhone: 317-420-2323\nInstagram: @vida.restaurant\nSports culture doesn't totally revolve around IndyCar in Indianapolis. \"The Pacers basketball team is really fun to go and watch live at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse,\" says Ericsson. \"When my friends are in town, we try to go down and see them.\" Designed to reflect Indiana's rich basketball heritage, it's the home court for the NBA's Indiana Pacers and the WNBA's Indiana Fever. Beyond basketball, the venue hosts big-name concerts, college tournaments and other events, including the AT&T WNBA All-Star 2025 Game in July.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite: http://www.gainbridgefieldhouse.com/\u00a0\nAddress: 125 S Pennsylvania St., Indianapolis, IN 46204\nPhone: 317-917-2727\nInstagram: @gainbridgefieldhouse\nIndianapolis has many cultural landmarks that explore artistry and achievement from different perspectives. In downtown Indianapolis, the esteemed Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art houses one of the most celebrated collections of Native American artworks, and the Soldiers and Sailors monument honours Indianians who've served from the Revolutionary War to the Spanish-American War. But one of the city's most recognisable cultural attractions is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum which preserves and interprets the history of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home to the legendary Indianapolis 500 \u2013 the world's largest single-day sporting event.\nAfter a 17-month renovation, the museum reopened in April 2025 intending to make the history and culture of racing more accessible to non-fans intrigued by the racetrack. But even for racing experts like Ericsson, the museum is a thrilling experience.\u00a0\n\"I recently went to the reopening of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum which they just put like, $60m (\u00a345.6m) into updating to make it a state-of-the-art museum,\" says Ericsson. \"I was blown away when I went there \u2013\u00a0it's really helpful to understand 100 years of history and gives you an idea of how the Indy 500 became so big and popular.\"\nLocated in the centre of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway racetrack, the museum honours more than a century of racing history. The Speedway itself, a 4km track built in 1909, is a National Historic Landmark, and daily tours allow guests to get an in-depth look at the history and significance of this sporting venue. What began with a collection of just 12 race cars has grown into one of the world's most famous motorsports collections, now featuring more than 150 vehicles and thousands of other racing artefacts. One of the museum's highlights is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame, which honours legends of racing like Wilbur Shaw, AJ Foyt and Janet Guthrie.\u00a0\u00a0\nWebsite: https://imsmuseum.org/\nAddress: 4750 W 16th St., Indianapolis, IN 46222\nPhone: 463-244-2680\nInstagram: @imsmuseum\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Grip strength is associated with a range of health outcomes, from type 2 diabetes to depression. Here\u2019s how to check yours.\nIn a world of technologically-driven longevity clinics with their increasingly sophisticated imaging scans, some of which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, it turns out that one of the best assessments of muscle strength and quality is to simply sit in a chair and squeeze a tennis ball.\u00a0\nThat's the recommendation offered by Joshua Davidson, a strength and conditioning researcher at the University of Derby who studies hand grip strength, a metric increasingly recognised as one of the most reliable markers of human health.\nWhen testing grip strength in clinical trials, scientists typically use a hand dynamometer, a device which you squeeze as hard as possible to measure the force generated by the muscles in your hand and forearm. Several companies are now attempting to take the dynamometer out of the clinic and into the home, combining easy-to-use devices with mobile apps to let anyone chart their grip strength over time.\nHowever, according to Davidson, you can still get a decent idea through a simple \"squeeze test\" with a tennis or stress ball. \"All you need is any object that you can grasp and can be deformed without causing pain or discomfort,\" he says. \"Simply squeeze it for as long as you can before your grip fatigues. Being able to maintain a maximal squeeze on something like a tennis ball for 15-30 seconds would be a good standard to strive for.\" Noting down how long you can squeeze can help you track your grip strength over time.\u00a0\nOf course, as Mark Peterson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation professor at the University of Michigan points out, having a weak grip strength alone will have relatively little impact on your everyday life directly, beyond making it a little bit harder to open cans or jars. But researchers are increasingly using grip strength as a proxy for overall musculoskeletal strength throughout the body. It can reflect whether a person is active enough or too sedentary and indicate their risk of frailty \u2013 the condition of being vulnerable as a result of a decline in one's physiological health.\nThis first came to scientists' attention through a particularly notable study of nearly 140,000 adults across high, middle and low-income countries which found grip strength was a better predictor for premature death than other more obvious indicators such as blood pressure.\nOther research has revealed that a person's grip strength can indicate their likelihood of living past 100. In one study, volunteers had their grip strengths measured in 1965-1968, when they were between 56 and 68 years old, and their survival was tracked for the next 44 years. Those who became centenarians were 2.5 times more likely to have had grip strength results in the highest third, compared to those who died before the age of 79.\u00a0\u00a0\nDarryl Leong, an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Canada, explains that your handgrip strength \u2013 and therefore your overall muscular strength \u2013 is a sum of your nutrition, physical activity and whether you have any illnesses. \"This is the reason it's associated with so many health outcomes,\" he says.\nOne study which used dynamometer testing found that grip strength scores of less than 25.5 kilograms for men and 18 kilograms for women suggests a heightened risk of sarcopenia throughout the body, the progressive loss of muscle mass and function which is linked to decreased strength and mobility in later life, and a greater likelihood of falling and developing fractures.\nGuillaume Par\u00e9, a practising physician and a professor of medicine at McMaster University, says that it's possible to tell a lot even from a simple handshake, with grip strength serving as a marker for whether someone is likely to have sarcopenia. \"Weaker handshakes where fingers struggle to close completely around my hand, or where hand muscles are emaciated, are red flags,\" he says.\nBut the links between grip strength and longevity go well beyond physical capabilities. Studies have shown that muscle is a key player in the metabolic system, acting as a reservoir which can soak up excess blood glucose and help prevent the development of insulin resistance. Because of this, a weaker grip can indicate that a person is more prone to a plethora of problems linked to metabolic dysfunction, ranging from type 2 diabetes to lower bone mineral density, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and depression.\nIf you do have a dynamometer to hand, you can use the chart above to compare your grip strength against. The results were taken from a study on the average grip strength measurements for healthy people in each sex across different age groups.\nBack in 2022, Peterson led a study which assessed the grip strength of 1,275 men and women and compared these results to an analysis of their DNA. The team found that those with lower grip strength scores showed signs of accelerated ageing. Specifically, they had differences in their DNA methylation patterns \u2013 tags associated with our DNA which can alter the way it is read over our lifetimes. Methylation patterns often change in response to environmental or lifestyle factors, such as obesity, pollution or even social stress, among many other things.\nWrist curls: Improve your grip strength\nBegin by sitting with your arms on your lap. Grip a can in your hand, with your palm facing upwards. Then slowly bring the can upwards towards your body, without moving your arm. Hold it there for a second, and carefully lower it back down. With practise, aim to build up to doing five sets of 20 repetitions.\nFor Par\u00e9 this is unsurprising, as he says he sees grip strength as a key marker of both disease resilience and likelihood of recovering from chronic illnesses. For example, research in cancer patients shows that those with poorer grip strength are more likely to experience sudden weight loss or cachexia \u2013 extreme muscle or fat loss, despite eating normally \u2013 and thus worse prognosis and survival outcomes.\n\"It means that once we have a disease, our ability to fight it is limited,\" says Peterson. \"For example, the risk of dying from a pneumonia is much increased in individuals with lower grip strength, which makes sense considering the importance of good muscular health to properly clear the airways of sputum [the saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract as a result of infections].\"\nGrip strength isn't just something to be aware of in later life, either. Researchers have even found that the average grip strength of a population tends to correlate with how many medals a country is likely to win at the Olympic Games. Meanwhile, Par\u00e9 says that teenagers and young adults who have poorer grip strength are likely to be more prone to health issues at an earlier age. One study in Brazil showed that teenagers who spent more time on their screens, either on their phones or other devices, tended to have worse grip strength.\n\"There's data supporting the association of low grip strength with poor metabolic health even in young adults,\" says Par\u00e9.\nSo, can we improve our grip strength? Certainly, says Davidson, and it's something which you can work on irrespective of your age. He suggests simply using the tennis ball test to progressively work the muscles of your hand and forehand to contract at maximal power for as long as you can. With practise, you should see steady improvements over time, he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Sit-to-stand: The simple test that reveals how you're ageing\n\u2022 The ruler drop test: Check your reaction times\n\u2022 What your fingernails can reveal about your health\u00a0\nIt also isn't just about grip. Leong recommends working on being more physically active in general and training the muscles in your lower and upper body. If you do this, he says your grip strength will improve accordingly.\u00a0\nFor older adults, Leong suggests trying the timed get-up-and-go test. \"Here, the individual records with a stopwatch, the time taken to rise from a chair, walk three metres, turn around and return to the seated position,\" says Leong. \"This is a test of lower limb strength and mobility and will help improve your total muscle strength.\"\nDavidson says that general resistance exercises to improve muscle mass and maintain bone mineral density will lead to improvements in grip strength. \"We all need to engage in regular physical activity as we age,\" he says. \"You can work out at home either using specialist equipment or just things you have around the house. Two to three sets of single arm wrist curls, with reps of between 10 and 20, is a good exercise to start with. If you have a kettlebell at home, bicep curls are also good exercises to try.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

How backchannels and US mediators pulled India and Pakistan back from the brink3 days agoShareSaveSoutik Biswas and Vikas PandeyBBC NewsReporting fromDelhiShareSaveReutersCrowds gathered in Islamabad after the ceasefire announcement In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".Behind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.However, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.Yet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.As tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\". This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.What also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.Indian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: US and UK pressureSaudi mediation, with the Saudi junior foreign minister visiting both capitalsThe direct India-Pakistan channel between the two national security advisors (NSAs)Despite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals.

        "article_text": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.\nDespite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.\nIt also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. \nIn a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.\nDelhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".\nThe IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.\nEven Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\n\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.\nIndia's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".\nAs one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.\nUnlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.\nFor example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.\n\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.\nAddressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.\nIn their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.\nFurthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.\n\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. \nThe FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\n\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"\nAs things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.\nSeparately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.\nSuch reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.\nMr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.\nHe points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.\nOn Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.\nPakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.\nAs Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.\n\"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.\nSince Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.\nPakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.  \nLaser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement. \nDrones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek.\nExperts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.\nThe Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft). \nWhile many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities. \nIndia is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.\nPakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.\nHe said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities. \nMr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.\nProf Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\".\nWhile the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.\n\"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.\nEjaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\". \n\"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.\n\nWhile drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.\n\"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi.\n\"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\"\nClearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.\n\"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek.\n\"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\" ",

        "article_text": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.\nDespite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.\nIt also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. \nIn a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.\nDelhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".\nThe IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.\nEven Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persiste\nntly seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\n\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.\nIndia's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".\nAs one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.\nUnlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.\nFor example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, most IMF decisions are made not by a formal vote, but by consensus, where voting against a proposal is not an option. In case a member is strictly not agreeable to a proposal they can abstain & register their dissent, what India did in this case.\n\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.\nAddressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.\nIn their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.\nFurthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.\n\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. \nThe FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\n\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"\nAs things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.\nSeparately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.\nSuch reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.\nMr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.\nHe points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nSharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.\nPakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nPakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.\nLate on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" was false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.\nBut Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nOn 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments.",

        "article_text": "Five men are continuing to be questioned by police over an alleged terror plot in the UK.\nThe men, including four Iranian nationals, are being held over an alleged plan to \"target a specific premises\", the Metropolitan Police said.\nThey were arrested in Swindon, west London, Stockport, Rochdale and Manchester.\nThree other Iranian men were arrested in London on Saturday in relation to a separate counter terrorism investigation.\nOn Sunday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the two operations \"reflect some of the biggest counter state threat and counter terrorism operations that we have seen in recent years\".\nAs part of the investigation into an alleged terror plot police arrested the five men - two aged 29, a 40-year-old and another aged 46 - in the early hours of Saturday morning. The fifth person's nationality and age has not been confirmed.\nThe Met said the \"affected site\" allegedly targeted in the plot had been made aware and was being supported by police.\nFootage showed armed officers taking a man from a house in Rochdale, while another man was dragged through the street in Swindon with plastic bags over his arms. It is understood military personnel were involved in the Rochdale raid.\nIn Swindon, one eyewitness told the BBC that six men entered a cafe the suspect was in and ordered coffee and donuts before they followed him out and \"jumped on him\".\nSeparately, the Met said three Iranian men - aged 39, 44 and 55 - were arrested under section 27 of the National Security Act at addresses in north-west and west London, while searches continued.\nThe act covers offences deemed a threat to national security. Section 27 grants police the power to arrest someone without a warrant if they are reasonably suspected of being involved in \"foreign power threat activity\".\nCdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, stressed that they were not linking the two investigations.\nHe said the operations were \"certainly significant and it is unusual for us to conduct this scale of activity\".\nLast year MI5 said it had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022.\nDirector general Sir Ken McCallum, said these presented \"potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents\".\nThere have previously been calls to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - a major military and political force with close ties to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.\nThis would allow tighter control of UK borders and \"severe penalties\" for those who might be supporting the group\", Nick Aldworth, a former national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing, said.\n\"It becomes quite challenging when organisations that are proscribed are effectively part of the state,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nHe added it was \"unclear\" how much support the group had in the UK.\nJonathan Hall KC, an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the public was not aware of \"how aggressive Iran is willing to be\", adding UK authorities \"undoubtedly\" need more tools to deal with this particular case.\nThe use of the internet to organise attacks should be examined \"remorselessly,\" and people made aware of the full extent of the law, he told the BBC.

It is understood military personnel were involved in the Rochdale raid.In Swindon, one eyewitness told the BBC that six men entered a cafe the suspect was in and ordered coffee and donuts before they followed him out and \"jumped on him\".Video shows terror suspect being dragged in SwindonSeparately, the Met said three Iranian men - aged 39, 44 and 55 - were arrested under section 27 of the National Security Act at addresses in north-west and west London, while searches continued.The act covers offences deemed a threat to national security. Section 27 grants police the power to arrest someone without a warrant if they are reasonably suspected of being involved in \"foreign power threat activity\".Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, stressed that they were not linking the two investigations.He said the operations were \"certainly significant and it is unusual for us to conduct this scale of activity\".Last year MI5 said it had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since January 2022.Director general Sir Ken McCallum, said these presented \"potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents\".There have previously been calls to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - a major military and political force with close ties to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.This would allow tighter control of UK borders and \"severe penalties\" for those who might be supporting the group\", Nick Aldworth, a former national co-ordinator for counter terrorism policing, said. Eight arrested in two separate anti-terror operationsMetropolitan Police ServiceCounter-terrorism \"It becomes quite challenging when organisations that are proscribed are effectively part of the state,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.He added it was \"unclear\" how much support the group had in the UK.Jonathan Hall KC, an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the public was not aware of \"how aggressive Iran is willing to be\", adding UK authorities \"undoubtedly\" need more tools to deal with this particular case.The use of the internet to organise attacks should be examined \"remorselessly,\" and people made aware of the full extent of the law, he told the BBC.",

The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.\nIn July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.\nA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.\nBy that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.\nWithin Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.\nReligion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.\nAn armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.\nIn 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.\nFor several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nTensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.\nIndia responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.\nKashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.\nIndia and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.\nIn 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.\nNawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.\nBut a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab.

Islamabad has strongly denied backing the group in question.\nThe US-brokered ceasefire agreed between the nuclear-armed neighbours at the weekend appears to have held so far.\nBoth nations say they remain vigilant.\n\"If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given,\" Modi said in his speech on Monday. \n\"Terror and trade talks cannot happen together,\" he remarked. This was most likely a reference to comments from US President Donald Trump, who said he had told India and Pakistan his administration would only trade with them if they end the conflict.\n\"Water and blood cannot flow together,\" Modi added, this time referring to the suspension of a water treaty between India and Pakistan. \nHis comments come after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that his country had \"acted as a responsible state\", adding: \"Our honour, our dignity and our self-respect are more precious to us than our lives.\"\nHe said he believed the water issue with India would be resolved through peaceful negotiations.\nEarlier on Monday, top military officials from India and Pakistan discussed finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them over the weekend.\nAccording to the Indian army, the two sides spoke about the need to refrain from any aggressive action. \n\"It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,\" it said in a statement. \nIndia also announced it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns.\nThe recent tensions were the latest in the decades-long rivalry between India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over Kashmir, a Himalayan region which they claim in full but administer in part.\nThe hostilities threatened to turn into a fully-fledged war as they appeared unwilling to back down for days.\nBoth countries have said that dozens of people from both sides died over the four days of fighting last week, partly due to heavy shelling near the de facto border.\nAnnouncing the ceasefire on Saturday, Trump said \"it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much\".\nBoth India and Pakistan declared military victory after it came into effect.\nOn 7 May, India reported striking nine targets inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to the 22 April deadly militant attack in the picturesque Pahalgam valley. \nIn the days after the first strike, India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border shelling and claimed to have shot down rival drones and aircraft in their airspace.\nAs the conflict escalated, both nations said they had struck the rival's military bases.\nIndian officials reported striking 11 Pakistan Air Force bases, including one in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad.

Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote \"Starbase, Texas is now a real city!\" on his social media platform X.\nThe new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.\nThe city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.\nSince SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.\nAbout 500 people are estimated to live nearby.\nThe possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.\nThe first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. \nThe BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.\nStarbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.\nA bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.\nCurrently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.\n\nThe result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.\nThe top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.\nIn recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.\nThe headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.\nIn contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers \u2013 most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.\nEnvironmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. \nIn 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.\nThe company has called the fines the result of \"disagreements over paperwork\" and maintains it follows environmental laws.

        "article_text": "Jannik Sinner has been the men's world number one since June last year\nWhen Jannik Sinner lifted the Australian Open trophy in late January, nobody knew we would not see him on a court again for over 100 days.\nThree weeks after his third Grand Slam triumph it was announced the world number one had accepted a three-month ban for failing two doping tests in March 2024.\nSinner had been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol.\nBut the 23-year-old Italian was subsequently told he should bear responsibility \"for [his] entourage's negligence\" and received a suspension which ends on Sunday night.\nWith Sinner set to make his comeback at the Italian Open in the coming days, BBC Sport explains how he has not been usurped at the top of the ATP rankings and what has been happening over the course of his ban.\nWhen Sinner steps back on court in Rome this week, he will still be ranked as the world's leading men's player.\nDefending the Australian Open title opened up a huge gap of 3,695 points to Germany's Alexander Zverev - the player Sinner beat in the Melbourne final.\nBut, with four Masters tournaments to be played in Sinner's absence, it appeared there was ample opportunity for Zverev or Carlos Alcaraz to dislodge him.\nFrom his ostracised position, Sinner watched both of his nearest rivals fumble the chance to significantly narrow the gap.\nBy losing another Grand Slam final, Zverev had fallen short again in his quest to finally land a major title. It weighed heavily on his mind.\nThe 28-year-old German was beaten by American qualifier Learner Tien in the Acapulco second round, by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor in the Indian Wells second round, and by France's Arthur Fils in the Miami Open fourth round.\nLosing his opening match in Monte Carlo did irreparable damage, rendering his Munich title insignificant in his pursuit of Sinner.\nZverev believes the possibility of becoming world number one did not have an impact.\n\"I was just playing bad, to be honest,\" he said.\n\"Australia did affect me and there was a lot of things that, in my mind, I was not playing well.\"\nAlcaraz, already a four-time major champion before his 22nd birthday, had even further ground to make up.\nThe Spaniard started positively by winning the Rotterdam title, but a series of defeats in Doha, Indian Wells and - most damningly - Miami halted his momentum.\nIt meant Alcaraz was unable to regain top spot, even though he went on to win Monte Carlo and reach the Barcelona final last month.\nConstant talk of chasing Sinner had a negative influence on him.\n\"Since Jannik's ban started, a lot of people asked me about how important the moment was to reach number one again,\" said Alcaraz.\n\"I was thinking too much about it, instead of playing my good tennis and enjoying the time that I stepped on the court.\"\nInstead of another dominant player emerging, Sinner's absence produced a carousel of champions - including Britain's Jack Draper and Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, who both won their first Masters titles.\nIt means Sinner returns to an ATP Tour that has been blown wide open.\nWith Alcaraz injured and 37-year-old Novak Djokovic struggling, the current landscape appears to provide an opportunity for Sinner - who reached the French Open semi-finals last year - to hit the ground running.\nInside the doping deal for tennis' world number one\nSinner does not deserve any hate - Draper\nSinner is sure to receive a hero's welcome when he returns at the Italian Open.\nSupport from his compatriots has never wavered during the doping controversy, demonstrated by the 'Sinnermania' which swept the ATP Finals in Turin last year.\nThe man from the mountains in northern Italy enjoyed the greatest season of his career in 2024 - and one of the best in recent memory - so it is little wonder he is held in high esteem at home.\nThe reception might be frostier in the locker room, however.\nSinner has talked about how he felt \"uncomfortable\" around his peers at the Australian Open.\n\"It was a bit like some players looked at me differently and I didn't like it at all,\" he told Italian broadcaster RAI.\nThree-time major champion Stan Wawrinka was among many players who criticised  the way Sinner's case was handled, while plenty of others felt the timing of his ban was convenient.\nBritish number one Draper was one of a few players who did publicly back Sinner, reiterating his support in late April and saying the Italian \"doesn't deserve any hate\".\nWhile Sinner is not allowed to play competitively until Monday, he has been able to play some tennis.\nFrom the start of the ban until 13 April, he could practise at a private training base - as long as he did not come into contact with other professional players.\nSpeculation surfaced in March he had been hitting with Dominic Thiem - the recently retired 2020 US Open champion - after the pair were pictured having dinner together in Monte Carlo.\nHowever, Thiem laughed off the suggestion.\n\"I think for him and his level, I would not be [good] enough,\" Thiem told BBC Sport.\nUnder Wada rules, Sinner could start 'official training activity' from 13 April.\nSinner invited Draper - a friend he has played doubles with on the ATP Tour - to Monte Carlo for several days of practice sessions on the clay.\nAsked about Sinner's level, Draper told BBC Sport: \"He's very consistent, he's playing great.\n\"Maybe a little rusty in some areas, but with time he's improving every day. The more points we played, the more he was getting better.\n\"It was great to be around him for a few days and get some good sparring.\"\nSinner attended a Gucci event alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour during Milan Fashion Week in February\nSinner was surrounded by his trusted team in Monaco - coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill, plus fitness trainer Marco Panichi, physio Ulises Badio and osteopath Andrea Cipolla.\nDraper said the trip was strictly business.\n\"I didn't speak to him too much to be honest,\" added the 23-year-old world number six, who lost to Sinner in last year's US Open semi-finals.\n\"On the court, Jannik is always very professional \u2013 he's number one for a reason.\n\"He seemed in good spirits, had a great team around him and great people who have supported him through a tough time.\"\nOnce Draper moved on to the Madrid Open, Sinner enlisted the help of Norwegian teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer in practice sessions.\nOff the court, Sinner has spent time with his family back in Italy and has pursued his other interests outside tennis.\nShortly after the announcement of his ban, he was pictured sitting alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Milan Fashion Week.\nAccording to a source close to Sinner, the player has been enjoying skiing, biking and go-karting between tennis sessions in recent weeks.\n\"I think he is feeling refreshed \u2013 tennis is very relentless.

        "summary": "Still number one & 'sparring' with Draper - return of SinnerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jannik Sinner has been the men's world number one since June last yearJonathan JurejkoBBC Sport tennis news reporterPublished5 hours agoWhen Jannik Sinner lifted the Australian Open trophy in late January, nobody knew we would not see him on a court again for over 100 days.Three weeks after his third Grand Slam triumph it was announced the world number one had accepted a three-month ban for failing two doping tests in March 2024.Sinner had been cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol.But the 23-year-old Italian was subsequently told he should bear responsibility \"for [his] entourage's negligence\" and received a suspension which ends on Sunday night.With Sinner set to make his comeback at the Italian Open in the coming days, BBC Sport explains how he has not been usurped at the top of the ATP rankings and what has been happening over the course of his ban.How Sinner has remained the world's bestWhen Sinner steps back on court in Rome this week, he will still be ranked as the world's leading men's player.Defending the Australian Open title opened up a huge gap of 3,695 points to Germany's Alexander Zverev - the player Sinner beat in the Melbourne final.But, with four Masters tournaments to be played in Sinner's absence, it appeared there was ample opportunity for Zverev or Carlos Alcaraz to dislodge him.From his ostracised position, Sinner watched both of his nearest rivals fumble the chance to significantly narrow the gap.By losing another Grand Slam final, Zverev had fallen short again in his quest to finally land a major title. \"I think for him and his level, I would not be [good] enough,\" Thiem told BBC Sport.Under Wada rules, Sinner could start 'official training activity' from 13 April.Sinner invited Draper - a friend he has played doubles with on the ATP Tour - to Monte Carlo for several days of practice sessions on the clay.Asked about Sinner's level, Draper told BBC Sport: \"He's very consistent, he's playing great. \"Once Draper moved on to the Madrid Open, Sinner enlisted the help of Norwegian teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer in practice sessions.Off the court, Sinner has spent time with his family back in Italy and has pursued his other interests outside tennis.Shortly after the announcement of his ban, he was pictured sitting alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Milan Fashion Week.According to a source close to Sinner, the player has been enjoying skiing, biking and go-karting between tennis sessions in recent weeks. \"I was thinking too much about it, instead of playing my good tennis and enjoying the time that I stepped on the court. \"Since Jannik's ban started, a lot of people asked me about how important the moment was to reach number one again,\" said Alcaraz.",

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.\nThe top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.\nSo much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.\nBut 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.\nBut is that accurate, or too simplistic?\nTo get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.\nBy 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.\n\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.\n\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"\nSplits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.\nDepending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.\nWestern Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.\nBut people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.\nAs a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".\n\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.\nCzechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"\nRussia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.\nFor VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.\nThe official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.\nThat invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.\n\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"\nThis is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.\nEurope has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.\nBut this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.\nFollowing WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.\nThe idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.\nMight we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.\n\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.\nThe war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.\nEurope, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.\nThe televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.\nA YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.\nIn Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.\nIf Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.\nAnd with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.\nThe message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.\nThat's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.\nThe Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.\nUrsula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"\nStill, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.\nChina, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.\nTrump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.\nWittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".\nDespite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.\nSome also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".\nPerhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.\nAnalysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. \nThis is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.\nMr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.\n\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.\n\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"\nEight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

        "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.\nThe recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\n\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\n\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.\nIndia and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. \nThe LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. \nCeasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)\nThe LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". \nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. \nNot surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\n\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.\nViolence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.\nThe 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.\nBetween 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \n\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.\nTensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\n\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.\nMr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\n\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.\nMr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.\nHe argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \nThe hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.\nSome experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\n\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"\nIn his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \n\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.\nToday, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\n\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.\nIt was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri claimed victory in Miami to make it three wins in a row, beating team-mate Lando Norris in a McLaren one-two.\nPiastri now leads the drivers' championship by 16 points from Norris.\nMeanwhile, Ferrari were embroiled in a controversy over team orders after Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc were both asked to swap positions.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions after the Miami Grand Prix.\nWhat on earth is wrong at Ferrari? - Jonathan\nAfter the Miami Grand Prix, the questions in Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur's news conference focused largely on the team orders debate between the team and drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc during the race.\nVasseur became a little frustrated with this, and in the end said: \"It's not the story of the day,\" pointing out that the only difference it made in the end was which driver finished seventh and eighth.\n\"I would be much more keen to speak about why we finished one minute behind McLaren,\" he said.\nVasseur claimed that in the race, the car's pace was a match for the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the Mercedes, but Ferrari paid the price for their poor grid positions. McLaren, he admitted, were \"on another planet\".\nCharles Leclerc qualified eighth and Lewis Hamilton 12th, Ferrari's worst qualifying result of the season, and that was largely because they were struggling to get the best out of new tyres.\nThat's why Hamilton and Leclerc ran on used tyres in the second set of qualifying. As Vasseur put it: \"Everybody improved 0.5-0.6secs between scrubbed to new and we lost 0.2-0.3secs.\"\nAsked why Ferrari struggled with tyres in Miami, he said: \"That's a good question. If I knew the answer, I would do a step forward and we would have fixed it between Q2 and Q3.\n\"You always have to operate the tyres in a very narrow window. It's different from track to track, it's different from compound to compound, from track temp to track temp. And it's always after the session that you say, 'OK, I could have done differently.'\"\nBut that was just Miami. The wider issue is that the car is not where Ferrari expected it to be at the start of this season, after running McLaren so close for the constructors' title last year. \nOther teams - especially McLaren - made more progress over the winter, and Ferrari simply need to make the car faster.\nOn average, it is the slowest of the top four teams, and Ferrari have scored only one grand prix podium, thanks to Leclerc in Saudi Arabia.\nHamilton won the sprint in China, but that seems to be a case of him and the team finding a good set-up after just one practice session, while others did not, and then benefiting from clean air at the start of the race.\nAs Leclerc put it: \"Lewis did an outstanding job. Maybe some drivers didn't put everything together in (sprint) qualifying and he managed to do that and managed to outperform the car a bit. \n\"Then tyre degradation being a big thing, when you start in front, everything comes to you a bit more. Lewis made a difference on Friday and Saturday.\"\nThere are what Vasseur calls \"some small upgrades\" coming at the next two races in Imola and Monaco. And Vasseur hopes that the stricter rules on front wing deflection that are being introduced at the subsequent race in Spain will make a difference. \n\"Everybody will have a new front wing in Barcelona,\" he said. \"By definition and by regulation. I think it will be perhaps a reset of the performance of everybody.\"\nThe implication is that McLaren are benefiting from exploiting this phenomenon. McLaren themselves say they expect it to make little difference to them.\nFerrari progressed well with upgrades in both 2023 and 2024 after difficult starts. Vasseur remains confident they can do the same this year.\nHamilton said on Sunday: \"I feel optimistic for the future. I think this car really does have performance. Something's holding us back at the moment. We've lost performance since China. And it's there, it's just we can't use it. Until we get a fix for that, then this is where we are.\"\n'Fire in my belly' led to team orders controversy - Hamilton\nVerstappen 'not racing very smart' - Norris\nIs the risk that Mercedes took bringing Kimi Antonelli into the team now rather than later paying off? \u2013 Callum\nKimi Antonelli had had a steady start to his debut Formula 1 season, as he said was his plan from the start - he wanted to build steadily and not make big errors.\nIn Miami, the 18-year-old for the first time showed a glimpse of the high potential Mercedes believed him to have, and which persuaded them to throw him in at the deep end this year.\nHe was confident in the car from the start, and he was always the faster Mercedes driver over one lap.\nPole for the sprint race was an outstanding performance, and he repeated it with third on the grid for the grand prix. Neither race went as well, but team principal Toto Wolff believes that was evidence of Antonelli's continued need to learn in the complex world of F1.\nWolff described the qualifying performances as \"another proof of his talent and a good indication of how the future can be\".\nHe added: \"In the race, challenging, because it's so difficult here to find the right reference. The medium (tyre) stint, quick enough, you know, with George (Russell) holding on in the back on the hard tyre.\n\"And then when he went into the hard, he just lacked experience managing it the right way.\n\"(We're) finding the right references and trying to guide him, but when you're in that car, it's not easy. It's just part of the learning curve.\"\nWolff always said that it would take time for Antonelli to adapt to F1, and that's the way it is working out.\nAntonelli has a long way to go before he proves he is the generational talent Mercedes - and others who have worked with him in the junior categories - believe him to be, but Miami was a good step in the right direction.\nKimi Antonelli finished sixth in the main grand prix in Miami and seventh in the sprint race\nHow can Fernando Alonso turn his season around, having not scored a single point up until now? \u2013 Andrew\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso is not having his best season, and it's highly unusual to see that he has scored no points while team-mate Lance Stroll has scored 14 points and is 10th in the championship.\nThe bottom line is that the Aston Martin is a poor car. Alonso has made a couple of mistakes, but fundamentally he has been unlucky and Stroll has benefited from circumstances.\nAlonso is still comfortably faster than the Canadian - the two-time champion is 7-1 ahead across all qualifying sessions at an average advantage of 0.321 seconds.\nHe was driving well in Australia in the wet in an impressive sixth place, but crashed on gravel at Turn Six. The chaos in the race helped Stroll, driving well, to move up and claim that sixth place.\nStroll then benefited from the disqualification of both Ferraris in China, and was promoted to ninth place. There, Alonso retired early on with his brakes on fire.\nStroll benefited again from the chaos in the Miami sprint, where Alonso was driving well and on course for points when he was taken out in a crash with Liam Lawson.\nHis spin in the grand prix, while uncharacteristic, \"didn't change anything,\" he said. \n\"I lost five seconds and then 10 laps later I catch the same group of cars and was still in the same place and then benefited from the virtual safety car. \n\"Even with that, not enough (pace) to be closer to the cars in front today. We need to get better for Imola. We are not happy being at this pace but we are all trying the best we can.\"\nAston Martin team boss Andy Cowell praised Alonso's qualifying performance in Japan as \"outstanding\" and in Jeddah as \"impressive\". But with no retirements, Alonso finished just out of the points in both races.\nThe reality is that the car is eighth fastest in qualifying on average and in Miami was the slowest of all. So scoring points is always going to be difficult.\nCowell said in Miami that Aston Martin were \"not a happy camp and we're trying to work out (what has gone wrong)\".\nAlonso was frustrated Aston Martin had rejected his calls for an earlier change to slicks in the sprint on Saturday in Miami, and said on Sunday: \"I am trying to do my best behind the wheel.\n\"I nailed Japan, P11. Jeddah was nearly perfect. As I said (before), we have three or four opportunities when chaos happens and you have the opportunity to score points.\n\"There were three already this year. Australia, and I had the mistake and went on the gravel and went off. China, with three or four cars disqualified, and I had brakes on fire on lap one.\n\"And yesterday the track was for dry tyres and we kept with the inters for too long.\n\"We missed three opportunities to score points in my case and it is going to be one or two more in the season. I guess let's hope for some more.\"\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nAlpine poised to replace Doohan with Colapinto\nAudi announces second management restructure\nMiami Grand Prix review",

The team said no further comment would be made and Oakes declined to comment when contacted.\nA source told BBC Sport that it was Oakes' decision to leave. Others said that it came as a surprise inside the team.\nOakes, who moved to Alpine from his Hitech team that competes in the junior categories, was widely considered within F1 to have little power at the team, with former Renault team boss Briatore the real controlling force.\nBriatore's controversial return to F1 as a team leader 15 years after he was found guilty of fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix as Renault team boss was orchestrated by Renault Group chief executive officer Luca de Meo in July last year. \nOakes' departure comes just a day after it emerged that Alpine were poised to drop Australian Jack Doohan after just six races this season and replace him with Argentine former Williams driver Franco Colapinto.\nOakes was appointed in July last year after Alpine, who are owned by Renault, removed their previous team principal Bruno Famin and placed him elsewhere in the company. \nAnd it continues a turbulent few years at the team that have seen a continuous flux in senior management amid a run of disappointing results for Renault's factory team. \nRenault also decided last year to end their F1 engine programme, which had been involved since 1977 with only a couple of brief breaks. Alpine will use Mercedes engines next season.\nFamin also lasted less than a year in his role as team boss after replacing Otmar Szafnauer in July 2023.

Others said that it came as a surprise inside the team.Oakes, who moved to Alpine from his Hitech team that competes in the junior categories, was widely considered within F1 to have little power at the team, with former Renault team boss Briatore the real controlling force.Briatore's controversial return to F1 as a team leader 15 years after he was found guilty of fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix as Renault team boss was orchestrated by Renault Group chief executive officer Luca de Meo in July last year. Oakes' departure comes just a day after it emerged that Alpine were poised to drop Australian Jack Doohan after just six races this season and replace him with Argentine former Williams driver Franco Colapinto.Oakes was appointed in July last year after Alpine, who are owned by Renault, removed their previous team principal Bruno Famin and placed him elsewhere in the company. Alpine will use Mercedes engines next season.Famin also lasted less than a year in his role as team boss after replacing Otmar Szafnauer in July 2023. And it continues a turbulent few years at the team that have seen a continuous flux in senior management amid a run of disappointing results for Renault's factory team.",

        "article_text": "London is Europe's wealthiest city, yet for many living in the capital, having a place to call home feels out of reach, according to the Centre for London (CfL).\nEarlier this week, the independent think tank hosted the London Housing Summit, highlighting the challenges of - and possible solutions to - the housing crisis, which it says is \"spiralling out of control\".\nExperts agree it is a complex issue, but what do figures show us about the scale of the problem?\nAccording to data collected by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), there was an 8% increase in rough sleeping in the capital on the same period in 2024.\nNew rough sleepers account for almost half (47%) of the total number of those sleeping rough, intermittent rough sleepers account for 39% and 16% of the recorded number of rough sleepers were living on the streets.\nCHAIN's latest annual report for 2024/25 reveals rough sleeping in London has reached an \"all time high\".\nThe Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in London by 2030, and in January 2025 he announced an additional \u00a310m investment in a bid to achieve this goal.\nThe money will go towards expanding the network of its Ending Homelessness Hubs, which provide 24/7 specialist support for people new to rough sleeping and prevention services.\nCouncils have legal duty to house local people who become homeless. Typically, they put people up in hotels or hostels until more permanent arrangements can be made.\nSo, as homelessness has increased in recent years, so therefore has the financial burden on local authorities. \nThe umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is \"unsustainable\" and puts many councils at risk of becoming \"effectively bankrupt\", creating \"massive uncertainty\" to the future of local services.\nLondon Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by \u00a3330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.\nAccording to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.\nThis includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.\nThe human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.\nSpeaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a \"growing concern\" that people in temporary accommodation were \"internalising an issue that is a structural crisis\".\nLondon Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an \"emergency\" that was \"devastating the lives of too many Londoners\".\nThe organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions \u2013 like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change.\n\"We are providing \u00a31bn for crucial homelessness services so councils can support families faster. This is an increase of \u00a3233m from 2024 - 25, and London Boroughs have had a funding uplift by more than \u00a378m. \n\"We are also tackling its root causes by building 1.5 million new homes, boosting social and affordable housing and abolishing section 21 no fault evictions.\"\nThe private rental sector in London has shrunk, as landlords increasingly decide to sell their properties.\nAccording to analysis by Trust for London, 45,000 homes were lost from the sector in this way between April 2021-December 2023, equating to a net reduction of 4.3%.\nThe charity also said the sector was shrinking at a much faster rate the most affordable areas to rent in, which it believed had a \"particular impact\" on the ability of low-income households to access private rented homes.\nThe National Residential Landlords Association said \"uncertainty over proposed tax and regulatory changes is leading many landlords to consider leaving the market\". \nThe association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.\nLondon's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nPolling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.\nBoth the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.\nThe upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester. \nThe think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.\nThis comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is \"no time to waste\" and that it's \"crucial\" to \"get Britain building\".\nWhile targets are in place for new homes \u2013 delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London. \nCentre for London's polling revealed a third of Londoners have experienced damp and mould and over a quarter were unable to keep their homes warm.\nHousing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa uses social media to campaign on issues related to damp and mould and told Eddie Nestor on BBC Radio London, the situation is \"horrific\", adding \"there are times when I ask myself surely it cannot get worse than this?\".\nDuring the mayoral election campaign of 2024, Sir Sadiq pledged his support for a rollout of high-tech mould sensors, which City Hall said would provide an \"early warning system\". \nIndustry leaders have warned there is a 'dire shortage' of construction workers. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that there are over 35,000 job vacancies and employers report that over half of vacancies cannot be filled due to a lack of required skills \u2013 the highest rate of any sector.\nThe additional requirement of 160,000 construction workers applies specifically to meeting the need of Labour's housebuilding targets. Ahead of the government's pledge to build 1.5m new homes, the CITB had already estimated there would need to be a quarter of a million new construction workers to meet the country's housing demands.\nBefore the 2025 spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced \u00a3600m worth of investment to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers, and education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has committed to 'skills bootcamps' in the construction sector being expanded, with \u00a3100m to train, upskill and develop workers.\nSo what's the plan for London?\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Sir Sadiq Khan had made the capital's housing crisis a \"a key priority for his mayoralty\".\nIn 2018, City Hall established the Mayor's Construction Academy (MCA), a scheme aimed at helping Londoners gain the skills needed to enter the construction industry. \nThe mayor's office said it hoped the MCA would help address the need for more skilled construction workers in London.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

        "article_text": "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.\nIt was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".\nFor someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something. \nI recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline. \nWhile this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell. \nCarney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\". \nHis supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey. \n\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"\nAt his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.\n\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.\nIn normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.\nWhen I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.\n\nMr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.\nIt was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him. \nThis bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.\nThe election result was staggering. \nEntering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls. \nPierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide. \nBut then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened. \nThen after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.\nThe election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump. \nPoilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government. \nCarney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump. \nAnd incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.\n\nCarney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier. \nHe also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere. \nCanada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.\nIn any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards. \nHe seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.\nOn Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.\nAll roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.\nAssuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world. \nIt is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.\nAll of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process. \nJapan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations. \nThe EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.\nIt comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.\nThere is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions. \nThe flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.\nAs a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.\nBut Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue. \nHe will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US. \nThe Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.\nThis is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.",

        "article_text": "On Wednesday, a cache of dazzling jewels linked to the Buddha's mortal remains, which have been hailed as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era, will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.\nFor over a century these relics, unearthed from a dusty mound in northern India in 1898, have sat largely unseen, cradled by a private British collection.\nNow, as the gems prepare to leave the custody of their keepers, they are stirring not just collectors' appetites but also some unease.\nThey come from a glittering hoard of nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, topaz, sapphires, and patterned gold sheets, first glimpsed deep inside a brick chamber in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India, near the Buddha's birthplace.\nTheir discovery \u2013 alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself \u2013 reverberated through the world of archaeology. Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia and worldwide head of Asian Art, believes this is \"among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time\".\nYet as these relics now face the glare of the auction room, experts tell the BBC that a question hangs heavy: can the sale of treasures so intimately woven into India's sacred past be considered ethical?\nIn 1898, William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, where the Buddha is believed to have been born. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago. \nHistorians agree these relics, intact until then, are the heritage of both the Buddha's Sakya clan descendants and Buddhists worldwide. The bone relics have since been distributed to countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where they continue to be venerated. \n\"Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?\" wonders Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian. \"And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?\n\"Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask \u2013 custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?\"\nChris Pepp\u00e9, great-grandson of William, told the BBC the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".\nJulian King, Sotheby's international specialist and head of sale, Himalayan Art, New York told the BBC the auction house had made a thorough review of the jewels.\n\"As is the case with any important items and collectibles that are offered for sale at Sotheby's, we conducted requisite due diligence, including in relation to authenticity and provenance, legality and other considerations in line with our policies and industry standards for artworks and treasures,\" King said.\nAshley Thompson, of Soas University of London, and curator Conan Cheong, both experts in Southeast Asian art, have more questions. In a joint statement they told the BBC: \"Other ethical questions raised by the sale are: should human remains be traded? And who gets to decide what are human remains or not? For many Buddhist practitioners around the world, the gems on sale are part and parcel of the bones and ash.\"\nThe sale of the relics has also sparked concern among Buddhist leaders.\n\"The Buddha teaches us not to take other people's possessions without permission,\" Amal Abeyawardene of London-based British MahaBodhi Society, told the BBC. \"Historical records indicate that the Sakyamuni clan were granted custody of these relics, as the Buddha emanated from their community. Their wish was for these relics to be preserved alongside adornments, such as these gems, so that they may be venerated in perpetuity by the Buddha's followers.\"\nChris Pepp\u00e9 has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins. That's when he began researching their discovery by his great-grandfather.\nThe Los Angeles-based television director and film editor wrote he had found 1898 newspaper reports - from Reuters to the New York Tribune - announcing the find of Buddha's remains.\n\"The colonisation of India by the British had been a source of some cultural shame for me [and continues to be] but, amidst the treasure hunters who hauled their finds back to England, there had also been people focused on the pursuit of knowledge,\" Chris Pepp\u00e9 writes.\nHe noted his research revealed a lot about his ancestors who he had dismissed as \"prejudiced Victorians from a bygone era\".  \n\"I learned that Willie Pepp\u00e9's first wife chose to travel around India for her honeymoon and loved the country and its culture. Sadly, she died from an unspecified illness. I learned that my grandmother was outraged at the land laws that applied to Indian women.\n\"And I learned that the excavation of the stupa was an attempt by Willie Pepp\u00e9 to provide work for his tenant farmers who had fallen victim to the famine of 1897.\"\nHe writes his great-grandfather's \"technical diagrams of ramps and pulleys suggest that he was also a trained engineer who couldn't resist a project\".\nWilliam Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.\nOnly a small \"portion of duplicates\", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the Pepp\u00e9 family, he notes. (Sotheby's notes say Pepp\u00e9 was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)  \nSources told the BBC the auction house considers the \"duplicates\" to be original items considered surplus to those donated, which the \"Indian government permitted Pepp\u00e9 to retain\". \nOver the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The Pepp\u00e9 family has also launched a website to \"share our research\".\nSome scholars argue Buddha relics should never be treated as market commodities. \n\"The Sotheby's auction transforms these highly sacred materials into saleable objects, in continuation of acts of colonial violence which extracted them from a stupa and called them 'gems' and 'objects of interest to Europeans', creating a false division with the ash and bone fragments they were consecrated with,\" say Thompson and Cheong. \nChris Pepp\u00e9 told the BBC that in all the monasteries he had visited \"no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics\".\n\"A few Buddhist academics\u00a0at western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such.\u00a0It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,\" he said.\nPepp\u00e9 said the family \"looked into donation [of the relics] to temples and museums and they all presented different problems on closer scrutiny\".   \n\"An auction seems the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists and we are confident that Sotheby's will achieve that.\" \nSome also point to The Koh-i-Noor, seized by the British East India Company and now part of the Crown Jewels, with many Indians viewing it as stolen. Should the Buddha's jewels be next?\n\"Repatriation, I believe, is seldom necessary,\" says Ahuja. \"Such rare and sacred relics that are unique and which define a land's cultural history, however, deserve the government's exceptional attention.\"",

I had a clear vision for my life.\"\nBujumbura, located on the north-eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, is the commercial capital of a nation which is one of the world's poorest in terms of GDP per capita, according to the World Bank.\nBorn in the Buyenzi area of the city, Ndayishimiye is the eldest of three siblings and has another five half-siblings. His family later moved to the \"dumpsite neighbourhood\" of Buterere.\nHis skills on a football pitch helped him stand out even if, on occasion, he had to train barefoot.\nWhen bigger clubs came calling, he would even have to deal with bouts of jealousy from his peers.\n\"One day I had to borrow boots from a friend when a second division club, Les Lierres, had agreed to sign me,\" he said.\n\"I was devastated when he refused to lend me the boots [for a trial], but I didn't give up.\"\nAfter a spell playing for Aigle Noir in Burundi's southern province of Makamba, Ndayishimiye got his big break in Europe in January 2020 when he joined Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor.\nJust a year later he was on the move again, sealing a switch to Istanbul Basaksehir.\nThe defender is now well settled on the Cote d'Azur as vice-captain of Nice.\nHe has two children under five, is a committed Muslim, and retains links to his homeland with his support of Burundian musicians, whom he regularly listens to at home and in his car.\nThe centre-back says his story should serve as an inspiration to others.\n\"I knew that there was no other way to help me get out of this life than through football,\" he said.\n\"You should not lose hope. Look at the homes you grew up in, look at your destitute families, then wake up early and work hard to get your families out of poverty.\n\"So, it is vital for the youth to keep hope, respect God and work hard. None of us were born with the success we've reached.\"\nNdayishimiye's message about resilience will be important over the next few months, as he could be out of action until 2026 after rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in training last week.\nNdayishimiye spent two years playing in Turkey before joining Nice\nNdayishimiye's performances in his first full Ligue 1 campaign with Nice were strong enough to see him nominated for the Prix Marc-Vivien Foe Award, an award handed to the best African footballer in France.\nBefore suffering his injury, Ndayishimiye was leading from the front in the club's bid to reach the Champions League and, while wearing the captain's armband, he netted the killer third goal against Paris St-Germain last month.\nThat header kept his side in the hunt for a place at Europe's top table and ended PSG's hopes of becoming the first team to complete an unbeaten season in the French top flight.\nWhile usually taking acclaim from the stands at the Allianz Riviera, Ndayishimiye is well aware that playing in Europe comes with its downsides.\n\"Some of my team-mates here have been racially abused,\" he said.\n\"I always tell them 'let's focus on the job that brought us here. Let's shut those jealous people up with our performances'.\n\"Frankly, racism is like a pandemic - undefeatable anytime soon.\"\nNdayishimiye is proud of being black, but feels there is little he can do to combat discrimination in the game.\n\"Even before us, Yaya Toure tried his best, Samuel Eto'o tried but they couldn't succeed,\" he said.\n\"I can't do anything about it. I have no power.\n\"If I'm abused, it won't affect me because I know why I came \u2013 just to play football.\"\nBurundi's sole appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations came at the 2019 edition, when the side lost all three group games\nEven if Ndayishimiye makes his bow in the Champions League next season, he is still waiting to play at a major international tournament.\nHe was \"heartbroken\" to miss out on a place in Burundi's squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation (Afcon) as a 20-year-old, and the Swallows have not managed to qualify for the finals since.\nHowever, he is bullish about the country's chances of returning to Afcon in the near future \u2013 and going far at the tournament.\n\"There might be some challenges we don't always talk about, internal hurdles that we have to overcome, but ahead are three Afcons I want to lead my team to,\" he said.\n\"I'm now confident that I'll lead the Swallows to the upcoming 2027, 2029 and 2031 tournaments - and I believe that we will lift one of them.\"\nMeanwhile, Ndayishimiye is remembering his roots as he looks to the future.\nHe has ambitions to set up a football academy back in Burundi to support children from underprivileged families.\n\"A football career has a limited time span and I know that I have to make some savings, keeping in mind my poor background, so that I do not return to that life.\n\"That's advice I give my team-mates - manage your good salaries wisely so that we don't end up in regret.\n\"That's why, once I retire, I plan to open a school named after me.\"",

        "article_text": "Lando Norris won the Miami sprint race on Saturday before the qualifying session\nMiami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Date: 4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nMcLaren's Lando Norris said he was \"very happy\" after qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix, despite losing out on pole position to Max Verstappen.\nNorris ended up 0.065 seconds from the Red Bull driver and, while his satisfaction was mixed with some frustration, it was based on his feeling that he has made progress with some of the problems with which he has been struggling this season.\nThe Briton has been open about the fact he finds his McLaren car does not 'talk to him' in the way he would like when being pushed to the absolute limit on a qualifying lap.\nAnd while he again made a mistake that he felt cost him pole position, their communication has been better this weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium.\nNorris, who won Saturday's sprint race, said that \"Max did a Max lap once again and I can't fault him\". So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well. So yeah, I just expect a tough race from all accounts.\"\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

        "article_text": "Invented to satiate pregnancy cravings, Dubai chocolate is a rare combination of creativity, flavours and social media success that has broken all industry records.\nIt was a cold, damp evening in Munich in December 2024, but the festive tunes and the twinkling fairy lights at the Marienplatz Christkindlmarkt (Christmas market) lifted my spirits. With a mug of gl\u00fchwein (hot mulled wine) in hand, I made my way to the candy stall to get my usual supply of German Christmas cookies. But I stopped in my tracks when I realised that the longest queue was not for lebkuchen (gingerbread biscuits baked for Christmas) or the traditional stollen fruit bread, but for a new kid on the block: Dubai chocolate.\nThat was my first encounter with the viral chocolate in a land far from its birthplace. But by then, Dubai chocolate had already become a global sensation: a rich, sticky and unapologetically extra chocolate bar that had shattered industry records, won millions of hearts and was spreading like wildfire across the world.\nA decadent milk chocolate bar filled with silky pistachio cream, earthy tahini and crunchy shards of knafeh pastry, the original Dubai chocolate was launched by Dubai-based FIX Dessert Chocolatier in 2022 when its British Egyptian founder, Sarah Hamouda, had an urge to create something unique to satisfy her pregnancy cravings for knafeh and pistachio. FIX called their creation \"Can't Get Knafeh Of It\".\nCan't Get Knafeh Of It took the world by storm when TikTok influencer Maria Vehera posted a rapturous video of herself trying the chocolate bar inside her car in December 2023. The video quickly went viral, attracting more than 125 million views and scores of fans around the world who were willing to do anything to grab a bite. The bar became a craze and was promptly christened \"Dubai chocolate\".\nIn an interview with the BBC earlier this year, Yezen Alani, co-founder of FIX, described the international spotlight as \"flattering and humbling\". However, despite FIX's plans for global expansion, its Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar remains solely available in the UAE, pushing independent chocolatiers and multinational brands such as Lindt and \u00dclker to mimic the original and produce their own versions to meet global demand. These imitations, also known as \"Dubai chocolate\", have inundated supermarkets and neighbourhood bodegas all over the world.\nToday, Dubai chocolate can be found everywhere, from the online shelves of UAE's food delivery apps and the brimming counters of Istanbul's sweet shops to the packed aisles of London's Lidl stores and the chaotic alleyways of Mumbai's flea markets. Global demand continues to skyrocket, resulting in worldwide stockouts and an international pistachio shortage. It has spawned waitlists at chocolate counters across Europe and the United States and inspired limited-edition collaborations with major brands like Shake Shack and Starbucks. Supermarkets have begun rationing Dubai chocolate, and people have been caught smuggling the prized bars. In short, the Dubai chocolate craze has shaken the global chocolate industry.\nThis has opened up a whole new market for artisan confectioners worldwide, including the renowned Maison Samadi in London. Maison Samadi, one of the UK's oldest chocolatiers with roots in Lebanon, was the first to introduce their version of the viral Dubai chocolate bars, named \"Dubai Viral Style Chocolate\" in London. For Nabil Chehab, business development director at Maison Samadi, making Dubai Viral Style Chocolate was a natural segue in their chocolate-making journey. \"We were already working on our heritage collection when we discovered the viral Dubai chocolate. It fitted perfectly because it combined a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, the knafeh, which was a tribute to the Samadi family heritage, with chocolate, our core expertise,\" says Chehab.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nChehab tells me that the demand for their Dubai Viral Style Chocolate bars has far exceeded their expectations, likely due to the interesting concept behind it. \"It's remarkable how the FIX team came up with this innovative idea of having a 'dessert in a chocolate bar' that has now become more enjoyable and satisfying than just a regular chocolate bar,\" enthuses Chehab. For centuries, food lovers have relished knafeh on its own. Now, Dubai chocolate allows them to sample this well-known dessert inside a chocolate shell, making the experience even more intriguing and exciting.\u00a0\n\"The real success of Dubai chocolate stems from its texture,\" agrees leading Turkish food writer Aylin \u00d6ney Tan. \"The velvety gooeyness of the pistachio cream doesn't just feel good on your palate; it is also visually attractive. Additionally, the crunchy texture of the kadayif pastry from the knafeh makes the dessert even more irresistible.\"\n\"Chocolates with a palpable crunch, such as Swiss Toblerone and Ferrero Rocher, have always done well in the market,\" explains \u00d6ney Tan. \"Same with Dubai chocolate. Only in this case, the crunch goes an extra mile and primes the chocolate bar for social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\" As Vehera bites into the paint-splattered chocolate bar in her TikTok video, decadent pistachio cream oozes out and crunchy ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) sounds fill the foreground, making it a clear social media winner.\nHowever, \"although Dubai chocolate's instant growth has been fuelled largely by social media, the exclusivity of the original bar has kept the interest going,\" says Monique Naval, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. The original Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar is only available online at 14:00 and 17:00 through online food delivery app Deliveroo in the UAE. FIX produces around 500 bars every day, and they sell out fast. The limited availability, both temporal and geographical, creates a fear of missing out, further increasing interest and demand.\n\"Having Dubai in the name also adds to the chocolate's popularity and hype,\" says Naval. When people think of Dubai, they think of lavish hotels, glitzy malls, luxurious cars and gold-dusted desserts. Similar \"feelings of indulgence drive the success of Dubai chocolate,\" she adds.\nBeyond its viral fame, Dubai chocolate's resonance also lies in its deep Middle Eastern roots \u2013 tapping into family traditions of sharing sweets, gifting edible treats and the nostalgic flavours of knafeh and pistachios woven into daily life across the region.\nFor Chehab, the connection runs deep.\n\"When my wife's great-grandfather, Muhieddine Samadi, started Al Samadi Sweets in Beirut in 1872, knafeh was one of the first sweets he ever sold,\" he reminisces. \"I grew up in Beirut. As a kid, I remember taking the famous Lebanese shared taxi to Al Samadi Sweets daily, picking up a plate of knafeh for breakfast and eating it on my way to my father's shop. Little did I know [at that time] that I would be marrying Samadi's lovely great-granddaughter,\" he adds, with a twinkle in his eyes.\nIn an interview with Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said, \"I wanted the FIX experience to be different. I wanted people, from that first bite, to relive moments of their past.\" And for many fans around the world, that first bite delivers exactly what Hamouda intended: an edible journey back to bustling Middle Eastern souks, where merchants sell delicious local sweets and the air is dense with the aroma of pistachios.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0The baffling purple honey found only in North Carolina\n \u2022 The world's true cradle of chocolate\n \u2022\u00a0A beauty mogul's guide to luxury self-care in Dubai\n\"Sixty-eight percent of the world's consumers want to experience cultures other than their own and that includes a willingness and desire to try new flavours and ingredients,\" explains Naval. Pistachios \u2013 a Middle Eastern staple \u2013 are riding this wave too, billed as the next big seasonal flavour globally, and appearing in everything from lattes to liqueurs.\nAt the same time, Middle Eastern tourism is booming and Dubai has emerged as a culinary destination in its own right, with some visitors flying in just to taste the viral chocolate firsthand. What began as a simple chocolate bar in a Dubai dessert shop has evolved into a global sensation.\n\"I am not surprised,\" says Chehab, reflecting on the chocolate's meteoric rise. \"It is the perfect amalgamation of taste, texture, indulgence and nostalgia. It was born to be a champion.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

        "article_text": "Lando Norris won the Miami sprint race on Saturday before the qualifying session\nMiami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Date: 4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nMcLaren's Lando Norris said he was \"very happy\" after qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix, despite losing out on pole position to Max Verstappen.\nNorris ended up 0.065 seconds from the Red Bull driver and, while his satisfaction was mixed with some frustration, it was based on his feeling that he has made progress with some of the problems with which he has been struggling this season.\nThe Briton has been open about the fact he finds his McLaren car does not 'talk to him' in the way he would like when being pushed to the absolute limit on a qualifying lap.\nAnd while he again made a mistake that he felt cost him pole position, their communication has been better this weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium.\nNorris, who won Saturday's sprint race, said that \"Max did a Max lap once again and I can't fault him\". So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well. So yeah, I just expect a tough race from all accounts.\"\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

Could they be signs of a special kind of black hole?\nAstronomers had never seen anything like it before \u2013 something vast, in the depths of space, went boom. Telescopes on Earth picked up the astonishingly bright and unusual explosion in 2018, watching as it played out 200 million light years away.\nThe blast brightened rapidly and brilliantly, far more than one would expect for a regular star explosion, a supernova, before it disappeared. Given the label AT2018cow, the weird-looking blast \u2013 which was about the same size as our solar system \u2013 soon become known by a more memorable nickname: \"the Cow\".\nSince this dazzling event, astronomers have detected a handful of other, similar explosions across the cosmos. Described as luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBots), they all share the same characteristics.\n\"They are very luminous,\" says Anna Ho, an astronomer at Cornell University in New York, hence the L in LFBot. The blue colour is a result of the explosion's extraordinarily high temperature of around 40,000C (72,000F), which shifts light to the blue part of the spectrum. The last letters in the acronym, O and T, refer to the fact these events appear in the visible light spectrum (optical) and are short-lived (transient).\nInitially, scientists thought LFBots might be failed supernovae, stars that tried to explode but instead imploded, forming a black hole at their core that subsequently consumed them from the inside-out.\nHowever, another theory is gaining traction \u2013 that cow flares are triggered when an undiscovered class of mid-sized black holes, known as intermediate mass black holes, swallow up stars that stray too close to them. A research paper published in November last year described fresh evidence for this idea, suggesting that it might be the preferred explanation. \"The general sentiment is shifting in that direction,\" says Daniel Perley, an astronomer at Liverpool John Moores University.\nIf this turns out to be correct, it could provide vital proof of the existence of this elusive type of black hole \u2013 a missing link between the smallest and largest black holes in the Universe and a vital clue to one of its biggest mysteries, dark matter.\nThe original cow flare in 2018 was detected by a robotic survey of the sky that uses Earth-based telescopes called the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (Atlas). This system caught the explosion occurring in a galaxy about 200 million light-years from Earth. Noticeably, it was up to 100 times brighter than a regular supernova, and it came and went in just a few days. Normal supernovae take weeks or even months to run their course. This explosion also had a strange, flat structure, according to a observations by researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK.\nSince then, astronomers have identified about a dozen similar events. Most have also become known by animal-themed nicknames loosely based on the letters they are randomly assigned by the astronomical survey that discovers them. ZTF18abvkwla, also witnessed in 2018, is called the Koala. ZTF20acigmel, spotted in 2020, is known as the Camel. AT2022tsd, found in 2022, is the Tasmanian devil. And 2023's AT2023fhn is called the Finch or Fawn.\nAstronomers have increasingly been using telescope surveys to study large portions of the sky in an effort seek out these events. When one flares up, they can then send an alert out to other astronomers on services such as the Astronomer's Telegram, a kind of online message board for astronomical events. Such alerts aim to prompt other telescopes into action, pointing them towards the event in the hope of observing it in detail before the blast fades from view.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Where do Earth-threatening asteroids come from?\n\u2022\u00a0The search for our Sun's missing twin\n\u2022\u00a0Stupendously large: How big can black holes get?\nIn November, Ho and Perley discovered another new LFBot, this time designated AT2024wpp, but has yet to gain a nickname. \"We were thinking 'the Wasp',\" says Ho. This explosion was particularly interesting because it was the brightest LFBot observed since the Cow, and it was also discovered very early on in its brightening phase, meaning astronomers could train lots of telescopes on it \u2013 including the Hubble space telescope \u2013 in order to learn more about it. \"It's the best one since the Cow itself,\" says Perley.\nEarly observations hint that the Wasp was not caused by a failed supernova. In that theorised scenario, a star would collapse in on itself while in the process of exploding. Inside the star's shell, a black hole or a dense neutron star would then form, and blast out jets of radiation through the shell, creating what's called a central engine. This would explain the brief cow flare that was visible on Earth.\nBut the Wasp seemed to lack any sign of material flowing away from the explosion that scientists would expect from such an event, says Perley. However, he notes that current findings are preliminary. \"We're still analysing the data,\" he says.\nIn September 2024, Zheng Cao at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research and colleagues re-examined the first detected LFBot, and also found evidence that challenged the failed supernova theory.\nBy studying X-ray observations of the event, they found what appeared to be a disk of material surrounding the explosion. After making a computer model of the disk, they found that it looked like the remnants of a star that was being eaten by an intermediate mass black hole, one about 100 to 100,000 times the mass of our Sun. Larger black holes could have a mass millions or even billions of times greater than our Sun. (Find out just how big black holes can get in this article about the largest black holes in the Universe.)\u00a0\nAs the star was eaten, it would occasionally cause the black hole to suddenly brighten as larger chunks of the star were consumed, producing the Cow flares spotted by astronomers on Earth.\n\"I believe our study supports the intermediate mass black holes nature of AT2018cow and similar LFBots,\" says Cao.\nAnother idea is that LFBots are actually a class of giant stars called Wolf-Rayet stars that are being torn apart by much smaller black holes only 10 to 100 times the mass of our Sun. Brian Metzger, a theoretical astrophysicist at Columbia University in New York, is among those who support this idea. He says these could form in a similar way to pairs of black holes \u2013 which have been detected by the gravitational waves they produce \u2013 except on this occasion only one of the stars becomes a black hole.\nThe intermediate mass black holes theory is perhaps the most alluring and favoured idea at the moment, though. If correct, it would mean that LFBots are a unique opportunity for us to study mysterious mid-sized black holes. While astronomers are reasonably confident that intermediate mass black holes exist in the Universe, no-one has yet found definitive proof for them.\nAnd they could be extremely important, acting as the missing link between the smallest black holes in the cosmos and the largest, supermassive black holes such as the one at the centre of our own galaxy. LFBots could reveal the locations of intermediate mass black holes, and how common they are.\n\"The intermediate mass black hole model is the most exciting,\" says Perley. \"It is still kind of debated in the community whether intermediate mass black holes really exist. The evidence has been quire sparing.\"\nTo find out for certain what LFBots are, we really need a much larger sample of them. \"Unfortunately, they're really rare,\" says Perley. Data on around 100 of them would be an ideal next step, he adds. We might get a little closer to that number next year, when an Israeli orbital telescope called the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite (Ultrasat) is set to launch. It is expected to find many more LFBots among other cosmic transients, thanks to its very large field of view of 204 square degrees, equivalent to seeing 1,000 full Moons.\nOther space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), could gather more data about singular LFBots so long as they could be trained in the direction of an explosion while it is brightening. \"JWST would be perfect,\" says Metzger. However, getting time on the telescope to do such observations has proved difficult. \"I proposed this two times,\" says Ho, but she had no luck. \"I'll try again this year.\"\nUntil more data arrives, the mystery of these strange explosions will linger. What is clear is that LFBots have proved far more unusual than anyone expected.\n\"I thought this was going to be a fun, one-off project,\" says Perley. \"But it turned out to really be this completely separate type of phenomenon. They have become more and more interesting.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\". \nThe strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.\nPakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. \nIslamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. \nThis sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.  \nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nExperts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.\nIndia says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. \nAmong the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. \nThe deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. \nPakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.\n\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.  \n\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.\nThe India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.\nAjay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".\n\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nIndian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".\n\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.\n\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\" \nThe majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.\n\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.\n\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"\nPakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".\nDr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.\n\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".\nChristopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.\n\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.  \n\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.\nDespite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.\n\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.\nHowever, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.\nExperts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.\n\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.\n\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"\nDr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.\n\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.\n\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.\n\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"\nIndia is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. \nShortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.\nThis mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. \nThe crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week.",

        "article_text": "To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.\nThe recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.\n\"Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,\" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.\n\"Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,\" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.\nIndia and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. \nThe LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. \nCeasefire violations here can range from \"low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes\", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)\nThe LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a \"border drawn in blood, forged through conflict\". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, \"carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account\". \nSuch wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. \nNot surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.\n\"The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,\" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.\nViolence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.\nThe 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.\nBetween 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. \n\"During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,\" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.\nIt's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.\nTensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.\n\"This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,\" says Mr Krishna.\nMr Jacob says for some \"curious reason\", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.\n\"It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,\" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.\nMr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.\nHe argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. \nThe hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.\nSome experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.\n\"The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,\" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.\n\"For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.\"\nIn his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: \"A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished.\" \n\"I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,\" he told the BBC.\nBetween 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.\nToday, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.\n\"You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,\" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.\nIt was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield.",

        "article_text": "It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.\n\"Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,\" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. \n\"But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.\"\nShe had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. \nMoving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.\nLovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.\n\"Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,\" Lovina jokes. \"I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.\"\nSo she posted an open message on her Facebook account: \"Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?\"\nTo her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.\nShe quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.\n\"I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,\" she says. \"I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.\"\nLovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. \nAccording to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. \nIndians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.\nFollowing that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. \nShortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.\nLovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupra\u2060, Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. \nThey say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.\nThe community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. \nThey say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. \nA member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.\n\"The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,\" she says.\nBeyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. \nIn one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. \nNishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.\n\"The group was her first port of call,\" says Nishi. \"As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.\"\nAnother woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.\n\"I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,\" Priya says.\n\"Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused.\" \nSo she asked the group and they offered advice.\nPriya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.\n\"The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,\" says Priya. \"I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.\"\nThere has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. \nLovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.\n\"I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,\" says Lovina.\n\"I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.\"\nLovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. \nIt has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation.\nThe World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority.\nThe members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.\n\"We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,\" says Lovina. \"I think that's the biggest support system for us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

I can't believe it. There was big pressure and big nerves. I knew if I missed he could come back quickly,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"I was so nervous tonight. Mark is still a top player and put me under so much pressure. He's the best.\"\nAlong with the \u00a3500,000 top prize, he will climb to 11th in the world rankings when he returns to the main professional tour next season.\nZhao, who won the UK title in 2021, is the first amateur to triumph at the Crucible. He also becomes only the third qualifier after Terry Griffiths and Shaun Murphy to claim snooker's biggest prize since the tournament's 1977 move to Sheffield.\nHis achievement is all the more extraordinary given he was still suspended from the sport 12 months ago, with his burgeoning career abruptly halted when he was one of 10 Chinese players sanctioned in 2023 following an investigation into match-fixing.\nWhile Zhao did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself, and for those offences he received a 20-month ban.\nHis win over Williams was his 47th from 49 matches this term and vindicated the bookmakers' decisions to install him as one of the favourites before the tournament even got under way.\nTrailblazer Zhao set to take snooker to 'another level' in China\nMatch-fixing scandal to Crucible champion - fall and rise of Zhao\nWorld Championship: Results, schedule & roll of honour\nThis video can not be played\nI can't believe what I have achieved this month - Xintong\nZhao's win over Williams was a long-awaited moment for China, nine years on from Ding Junhui's 18-14 defeat by Mark Selby in the 2016 final.\n\"It is very good for Chinese snooker and I am very happy I have done this for them.\n\"I can't believe I could become world champion in such a short time [after the ban] so I am so proud of myself. It was nearly two years playing no competition, so my first target was to qualify. \n\"Now this will give them [children in China] power and in the future many Chinese players can do this.\"\nIt simply looked like a match too far for Williams, who overcame well-documented eye problems to reach a fifth final.\nHe appeared drained at times, following his semi-final success against world number one Judd Trump.\nThe 'Welsh Potting Machine' lost the two afternoon sessions by an aggregate score of 13-3 - a margin that proved too wide in a match which is sure to be viewed as a changing-of-the-guard moment.\n\"Unfortunately I was just never in the final from day one. I was behind from the start and could not get into it,\" said Williams.\n\"I said that if I could get out of the first session at 5-3 down it would have been a result, but I was 7-1 down and it was a bit far for me to get back. \n\"I've got nothing but admiration for what he's done, coming through the qualifiers.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'You can't feel sympathy' - Besiktas' Solskjaer discusses Man Utd woes\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer bounces in as light and airy as the summer room Besiktas have allocated for our interview.\n\"I came here to get away from people like you,\" he laughs, explaining the joke to club officials through his Turkish interpreter.\nHis mood is relaxed and jovial.\nOver the next 30 minutes, Solskjaer, who is 2,000 miles from his spiritual home in Manchester and 1,700 from his actual home in Norway, reflects on the lack of contact with former United colleagues, reveals his shock at the sale of Scott McTominay and worry over what's happening to his \"family\" at Old Trafford.\nBut this is not his priority right now. He must concentrate on a massive and highly pressurised managerial role and his first experience of an Istanbul derby away from home, when Besiktas face Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce on Sunday.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has won seven of his 14 games in charge of Besiktas\nIt is an important game. Besiktas need a result to maintain hopes of a third-place finish which, depending on who wins the Turkish Cup final, offers a Europa League play-off spot rather than a place in the second qualifying round.\n\"That's the deal I have made,\" Solskjaer says. \"It is more important than an extra few quid. If we get third, the players get an extra week off in the summer.\"\nFenerbahce are chasing the third - and currently dominant - Istanbul team, Galatasaray, for the title. Heading into the weekend, they are five points behind, with five games left. They cannot afford to slip up. Who knows what Mourinho has in store to turn the situation his way.\nIt is against this backdrop that Solskjaer has agreed to speak at length to BBC Sport for the first time since he lost his job at Manchester United in October 2021. Like Mourinho before him, the Norwegian paid the price for regression the season after he finished second.\nBesiktas are very much his club now. But events at Old Trafford are never far from his mind.\n\"Man United is my family and will always be part of me,\" he says.\n\"In football, you don't feel sorry for anyone because we are privileged, absolutely 100% privileged to be able to work in clubs like this.\n\"But for me, it is hard to watch because it is your family that is struggling. It is never easy at the weekend when you look at the table.\"\nHe is talking with incredulity about the fact United, at the time of this meeting, are 14th in the Premier League.\nThey were seventh when he was dismissed after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Two months before that they had been third, behind leaders Chelsea on goal difference.\nBut a terrible run of results, including a record 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool and 2-0 loss to Manchester City at Old Trafford where the scoreline massively flattered United, meant Solskjaer knew what was coming as the Watford debacle unfolded.\nIt has taken him a long time to return. Why Besiktas?\n\"You have not been here long enough,\" he says with a smile.\n\"The club is fantastic. I spoke to a lot without doing anything about it. This was the only one I spoke to where I looked back afterwards and thought 'I wish I was there' because there is so much potential.\n\"You feel the identity and culture in the club is aligned with you; the values about honesty, community work. We were the first club in Turkey to go abroad to play. It is very similar to Man United in that sense. It just reminded me of Man United when I was there.\"\nThe pay-off is telling.\nSolskjaer signed Maguire and made him captain at United\nAt United, Solskjaer had tried to instil the 'look after everyone' mentality he knew so well from Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\nHe took that approach from the first day he returned to United's Carrington training ground after taking an SOS call from then executive chairman Ed Woodward in December 2018.\nWoodward wanted Solskjaer to bring a smile back to the face of a club that had turned toxic as Mourinho's tenure drew to a close amid rancour and recrimination.\nThe new boss handed out chocolate bars to staff members \u2013 something he used to do in his own playing days. Beloved receptionist Kath Phipps was the first recipient. Solskjaer flew in for Phipps' funeral in January 2025. He went on to the wake, which was populated by so many of the old guard.\nSolskjaer noted that day, as did so many others, there seemed to be a disconnect between United's current leadership and the past.\nWe meet a day after United have beaten Atletico Bilbao to plant one foot into the Europa League final. His elation for players he knows well comes with a shocking revelation given his knowledge of the club and the advice he could offer, plus the elevated position he holds from his playing days, which goes far beyond a single \u2013 iconic \u2013 goal at the Nou Camp.\n\"For me, Harry [Maguire] has always been a leader and a fighter,\" Solskjaer says.\n\"I was never in doubt when I signed him and he walked in the door he would be captain for us.\n\"There is another captain there in Bruno [Fernandes]. The two of them are top human beings. I was so happy for them last night.\n\"Those two and Victor [Lindelof] are probably the only ones still at the club that I have heard from since I left. You want the best for them.\"\nHe doesn't say it \u2013 and wouldn't because by his nature he is not one to take cheap shots and he will never alter the fundamentals he took from his parents and has tried to pass on as a husband and father \u2013 but the lack of communication hurts.\nAn example of his values is shown a few minutes later when he is walking across from the Besiktas training ground from the summer house to the main building to get his lunch.\nTwo young supporters spot him and ask for autographs and selfies. Not only does he oblige, he stops 19-year-old Ecuador winger Keny Arroyo, a \u00a36.4m February arrival, who is about to walk past, to make sure he does the same.\nScott McTominay has helped Napoli lead Serie A with a flurry of goals since his move from Manchester United \nThere is a strong Manchester United undercurrent to the next game for Solskjaer.\nWorking with him at Besiktas is former United goalkeeping coach Richard Hartis and Tom Green, who left his job at United's senior performance analyst in February to take on the head of analysis role at the Turkish club.\nPlaying for Mourinho is former United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat and also a player Solskjaer knows very well in Fred, the Brazilian half of United's one-time 'McFred' midfield axis, alongside Scott McTominay.\nTalking about this offers an opportunity to despair at the recruitment and sales decisions his old club have taken, including allowing McTominay to join Napoli.\n\"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%,\" Solskjaer says.\n\"How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"\nMourinho and Solskjaer last met in 2021 when the Portuguese was manager of Tottenham\nSolskjaer assesses the work ahead of him in a pragmatic way. From a detached perspective, it seems many of the challenges he is facing are similar to those Ruben Amorim is experiencing at United.\nTo that end, a Europa League win could be crucial in buying Amorim time. It is something United came within a missed David de Gea penalty of achieving when Solskjaer's team were beaten by Unai Emery's Villarreal in the 2021 final.\n\"Everyone knows you need time to shape a team into what you want it to look like,\" said Solskjaer.\n\"But you have to manage it the best you can, not as you wish it was. There are things I want my team to do that this one can't. We have come into a difficult financial period because in the past the club has spent money, maybe not so wisely.\"\nI point out that is an observation I have heard about another club close to his heart. Solskjaer is about to answer but checks himself.\n\"Yes. But that's, you know when you\u2026\u2026.actually, I don't have to say that,\" he said.\n\"Look, recruitment is probably the most important thing in football.\n\"You need the structures right and you need to get the right people in.\n\"When you manage two, three, four or five different managers' players, it is hard to make it balance into a team you want to see. Everyone knows you need continuity and patience to get success, but not too many get it.\"\nSolskjaer has not spoken to Mourinho since his arrival in Turkey and says he is looking forward to meeting him again.\nI remind him of their spat in April 2021 \u2013 a week before Mourinho was sacked by Tottenham \u2013 when the Portuguese reacted badly to Solskjaer claiming Son Heung-min had cheated to ensure a United goal was disallowed.\n\"I would not feed my son if he behaved like that,\" chided the Norwegian at the time. Mourinho's response was classic: \"Sonny is very lucky his father is a better person than Ole. As a father, you always have to feed your kids, even if you have to steal.\"\n\"I remember that one,\" shrugs Solskjaer. \"You look after your own team.\n\"He has all the charisma of course and I don't think any of us change a lot when we have come this far.\n\"It will be good to see him again and hopefully the headlines will be about the team and the football that is played and nothing else.\"\nBesiktas beat Galatasaray on 29 March but have won just once in four games since.\nSolskjaer knows the atmosphere at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium will be white hot.\n\"I saw from Gala, when you are at home and winning these games there is nothing better,\" he says.\n\"If you are at home and you don't win, there is nothing worse.\n\"Football is decided by moments. You see last night [Thursday], Athletic had two or three massive chances and Victor saves one on the goal line. Then it all changes.\n\"The margins between winning and losing in football are so close. It is better to be lucky than good sometimes.\n\"Hopefully, it will be one of Jose's bad nights.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.\nThis is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.\nAt the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to establish that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.\nThe BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.\nSo far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.\n20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.\nAmong the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.\nThey had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.\nBairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.\nIn February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.\nOkhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.\nUnlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.\nIn total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.\nA few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.\nThere was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.\nA relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"\nIn our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.\nIn the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.\nIn 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.\nIn the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.\nIn 2023, the number rose to 37,633.\nIn 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.\nIn August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.\nHowever, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.\n\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.\nAfter almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.\nAccording to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.\nEven then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.\nThe cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.\nActual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.\nOverall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land. This means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.\nRussia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.\n\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.\nOne-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.\nWe also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.\nVolunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.\nIn 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.\nOne Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.\nThe one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).\nCalculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.\nThis is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.\nThe true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.\nAn assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.\nThat would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.",

        "article_text": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.\nYet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.\nEven scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. \nSix years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. \nAs the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.\nPresident Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\n\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.\nIndia and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.\nThe bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \n\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.\nOne reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.\nSince testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. \nIndia, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.\nFurther ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.\nIn 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.\nIn his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.\nAround the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. \nFormer Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \n\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.\nBut nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.\nIn March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)\nYet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \n\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \n\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\n\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.\nAt the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. \nWith new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  \nAnd as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.\nDespite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.\nYet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\n\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\n\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\"",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead \"accountable\".\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nPakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims. \nPakistan's military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said at least 26 people were killed and 46 injured. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.\nPakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of \"targeting terrorist camps\" is false.\nThe strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.\nThe 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.\nIt was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status in 2019.\nFollowing the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists visiting the region.\nThe killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country would hunt the suspects \"till the ends of the Earth\" and that those who planned and carried it out \"will be punished beyond their imagination\".\nHowever, India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam and it remains unclear who did it. \nBut Indian police have alleged two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.\nIn the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. \nBut many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.\nKashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.\nThe countries have fought two wars over it.\nBut more recently, it has been attacked by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nNeither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. \nUN chief Antonio Guterres quickly called for \"maximum restraint\" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged \"dialogue\" and \"de-escalation\".\nUS President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting \"ends very quickly\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments.",

India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.Where did India hit?Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.It said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.Why is Kashmir a flashpoint between India and Pakistan?Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.The countries have fought two wars over it.But more recently, it has been attacked by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink.",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

        "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.\nHe believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.\nSir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"\nThe ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.\nA blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.\nA host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.\nToby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.\nThe film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.\nSir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"\nSince then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.\nOcean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.\nThe new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.\n\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.\nThe process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.  \nSir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".\nSir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.\nIt is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.\nJust one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"\nBut in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.\nOne of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"\nDespite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"\nSir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.\nHe believes that could be transformational. \n\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"\nA healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.\n\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.\nAs he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.\nOcean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.\nYet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.\nEven scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. \nSix years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. \nAs the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.\nPresident Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a \"nuclear conflict\". On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.\n\"Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,\" Modi added.\nIndia and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.\nThe bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. \n\"India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,\" he told the BBC.\nOne reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the \"time or money\" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a \"clear qualitative\" edge in naval nuclear capability.\nSince testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. \nIndia, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.\nFurther ambiguity emerged in 2016, when then\u2013defence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel \"bound\" by the policy, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)\nThe absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.\nIn 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that \"nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India\", and would only be used if \"the very existence of Pakistan as a state\" was at stake.\nIn his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.\nAround the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official issuing a stark warning to India: \"I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surprise\u2026 You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.\"\nDuring the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not \"hesitate to use any weapon\" to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment.\nBut there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. \nFormer Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan \"knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory\" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. \n\"Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,\" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.\nBut nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.\nIn March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental firing of a missile\".)\nYet, the danger of nuclear war remains \"relatively small\" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. \n\"So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he said. \n\"In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy.\" ('Use it or lose it' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)\nSumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that \"neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo\".\n\"Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,\" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.\nAt the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. \nWith new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  \nAnd as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.\nDespite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.\nYet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.\n\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.\n\"The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large.\"",

        "article_text": "Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (\u00a3756m) bailout to Pakistan \u2013 a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.\nDespite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.\nIt also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to \"climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters\", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. \nIn a strongly worded statement India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.\nDelhi questioned the \"efficacy\" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's \"poor track record\" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for \"state-sponsored cross-border terrorism\" \u2013 a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to \"reputational risks\" and making a \"mockery of global values\".\nThe IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.\nEven Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persistently seeking the IMF's help \u2013 getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 \u2013 without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.\n\"Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,\" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.\nBut addressing Delhi's other concerns \u2013 that the IMF was \"rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism\" thereby sending a \"dangerous message to the global community\" \u2013 is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.\nIndia's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was \"circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities\".\nAs one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.\nUnlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions \u2013 a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.\nFor example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, IMF rules do not allow for a vote against a proposal - board members can either vote in favour or abstain \u2013 and the decisions are made by consensus on the board.\n\"This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,\" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.\nAddressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.\nIn their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the \"Global North\" and the \"Global South\". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.\nFurthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.\n\"It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,\" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.\nIf India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. \nThe FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.\n\"Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,\" said Mr Haqqani. \"If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF \u2013 as has happened with Pakistan earlier.\"\nAs things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.\nSeparately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.\nSuch reforms \"would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power\", said Mr Sharma.\nMr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using \"bilateral disputes at multilateral fora\", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.\nHe points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook",

        "article_text": "Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. \nBut why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?\nKashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.\nEven before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.\nUnder the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.\nThe maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.\nA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.\nIn July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.\nA second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.\nBy that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.\nWithin Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.\nReligion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.\nAn armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.\nIn 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.\nFor several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nTensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.\nIndia responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.\nKashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.\nIndia and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.\nIn 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.\nNawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.\nBut a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab.

Four key questionsLIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killingsHow old is this conflict?Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.Kashmir profile - TimelineA war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.What about hopes for peace?India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.GettyPakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered KashmirIndian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond?",

However, they reached lunch with a 20-point haul by no means secure at 109-4, needing 76 more.\nBut they were able to move into the top three places in the Division One table midway through the afternoon tea thanks to first-class debutant Zen Malik, who finished 49 not out off 73 balls, including a pulled six off George Hill to win it.\nWhile Warwickshire won their second game in four at the start of this season, Yorkshire have now lost two from four and are in the top flight's bottom three.\nThe hosts will be mightily frustrated at the fact they were unable to capitalise on the one-game availability of England batting duo Harry Brook and Joe Root.

        "article_text": "India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir have unleashed a wave of misinformation online, with unrelated videos purporting to be from the strikes gaining millions of views.\nDramatic clips debunked by BBC Verify have claimed to show attacks on an Indian army base and an Indian fighter jet shot down in Pakistan.\nOne video, which had more than 400,000 views on X at the time of writing, claiming to show an explosion caused by a Pakistani response was actually from the 2020 Beirut Port explosion in Lebanon.\nAn expert told BBC Verify that in moments of heightened tension or dramatic events, misinformation is more likely to spread and fuel distrust and hostility.\n\"It's very common to see recycled footage during any significant event, not just conflict,\" Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigations website, said.\n\"Algorithmic engagement rewards people who post engaging content, not truthful content, and footage of conflict and disasters is particularly engaging, no matter the truth behind it.\"\nOne of the most viral clips, which gained over 3 million views on X in a matter of hours, claimed to show blasts caused by the Indian strikes on Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A search for screengrabs from the video on Google found the footage actually showed Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip on 13 October 2023.\nWhile much of the debunked footage has purported to show the immediate aftermath of the Indian strikes, some clips analysed by BBC Verify appeared to be trying to portray the Pakistani response as being more severe than it actually was.\nOne video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the \"Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters\". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month.\nElsewhere, one set of photos purported to show an operation carried out by the Pakistan Air Force targeting \"Indian forward air-bases in the early hours of 6 May 2025\". The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3.\nThe Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views. \nBut two widely shared images actually showed previous Indian air force jet crashes - one from an incident in Rajasthan in 2024 and another in the Punjab state in 2021. Both crashes were widely reported.\nProf Indrajit Roy of York University said that the images \"are being generated with a view to get support for the military in Pakistan\".

In the aftermath of the deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, AI images circulated - with some seeking to dramatise actual scenes from the attack.\nVedika Bahl, a journalist with France 24, said the Pahalgam attacks had prompted a sharp \"uptake in misinformation from both sides surrounding the conflict\".\n\"Lots of this misinformation begins on X,\" she said. \"Eventually this trickles down over time from X to WhatsApp which is the communication tool which is most used in South Asian communities.\"\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.\nThat will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.\nIf businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax. \nIn India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.\nThis deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.\nHowever it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.\nThe UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.\nThe EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.\nLast year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.\nIt is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.\nHowever, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.\nThe UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.\nOne of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.\nThe British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.\nBut it does includes a three-year exemption on the social security paid by Indian employees working in the UK, on short-term visas.\nThis agreement, known as the Double Contribution Convention, designed to ensure social security contributions are not made in more than one country, was one of the elements India had pushed for during negotiations.\nThe UK's Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal would make it easier for people with certain skills to work in the UK temporarily.\n\"It opens up a small number of visas from an existing route for chefs and musicians and yoga teachers, very, very small, about 1,800.\"",

        "article_text": "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.\nHe believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.\nSir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"\nThe ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.\nA blue carpet will be rolled out at the film's premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall.\nA host of celebrities are expected to attend including Chris Martin and Coldplay, Benedict Cumberbatch, astronaut Tim Peake, Geri Halliwell-Horner and Simon LeBon.\nToby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.\nThe film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.\nSir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"\nSince then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.\nOcean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.\nThe new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. The trawlers are often after a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.\n\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.\nThe process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.  \nSir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".\nSir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.\nIt is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.\nJust one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"\nBut in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.\nOne of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"\nDespite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"\nSir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.\nHe believes that could be transformational. \n\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"\nA healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.\n\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.\nAs he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.\nOcean will be in cinemas across the country from Thursday.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

        "article_text": "London is Europe's wealthiest city, yet for many living in the capital, having a place to call home feels out of reach, according to the Centre for London (CfL).\nEarlier this week, the independent think tank hosted the London Housing Summit, highlighting the challenges of - and possible solutions to - the housing crisis, which it says is \"spiralling out of control\".\nExperts agree it is a complex issue, but what do figures show us about the scale of the problem?\nAccording to data collected by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), there was an 8% increase in rough sleeping in the capital on the same period in 2024.\nNew rough sleepers account for almost half (47%) of the total number of those sleeping rough, intermittent rough sleepers account for 39% and 16% of the recorded number of rough sleepers were living on the streets.\nCHAIN's latest annual report for 2024/25 reveals rough sleeping in London has reached an \"all time high\".\nThe Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in London by 2030, and in January 2025 he announced an additional \u00a310m investment in a bid to achieve this goal.\nThe money will go towards expanding the network of its Ending Homelessness Hubs, which provide 24/7 specialist support for people new to rough sleeping and prevention services.\nCouncils have legal duty to house local people who become homeless. Typically, they put people up in hotels or hostels until more permanent arrangements can be made.\nSo, as homelessness has increased in recent years, so therefore has the financial burden on local authorities. \nThe umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is \"unsustainable\" and puts many councils at risk of becoming \"effectively bankrupt\", creating \"massive uncertainty\" to the future of local services.\nLondon Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by \u00a3330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.\nAccording to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.\nThis includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.\nThe human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.\nSpeaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a \"growing concern\" that people in temporary accommodation were \"internalising an issue that is a structural crisis\".\nLondon Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an \"emergency\" that was \"devastating the lives of too many Londoners\".\nThe organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions \u2013 like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change.\n\"We are providing \u00a31bn for crucial homelessness services so councils can support families faster. This is an increase of \u00a3233m from 2024 - 25, and London Boroughs have had a funding uplift by more than \u00a378m. \n\"We are also tackling its root causes by building 1.5 million new homes, boosting social and affordable housing and abolishing section 21 no fault evictions.\"\nThe private rental sector in London has shrunk, as landlords increasingly decide to sell their properties.\nAccording to analysis by Trust for London, 45,000 homes were lost from the sector in this way between April 2021-December 2023, equating to a net reduction of 4.3%.\nThe charity also said the sector was shrinking at a much faster rate the most affordable areas to rent in, which it believed had a \"particular impact\" on the ability of low-income households to access private rented homes.\nThe National Residential Landlords Association said \"uncertainty over proposed tax and regulatory changes is leading many landlords to consider leaving the market\". \nThe association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.\nLondon's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nPolling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.\nBoth the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.\nThe upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester. \nThe think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.\nThis comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is \"no time to waste\" and that it's \"crucial\" to \"get Britain building\".\nWhile targets are in place for new homes \u2013 delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London. \nCentre for London's polling revealed a third of Londoners have experienced damp and mould and over a quarter were unable to keep their homes warm.\nHousing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa uses social media to campaign on issues related to damp and mould and told Eddie Nestor on BBC Radio London, the situation is \"horrific\", adding \"there are times when I ask myself surely it cannot get worse than this?\".\nDuring the mayoral election campaign of 2024, Sir Sadiq pledged his support for a rollout of high-tech mould sensors, which City Hall said would provide an \"early warning system\". \nIndustry leaders have warned there is a 'dire shortage' of construction workers. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that there are over 35,000 job vacancies and employers report that over half of vacancies cannot be filled due to a lack of required skills \u2013 the highest rate of any sector.\nThe additional requirement of 160,000 construction workers applies specifically to meeting the need of Labour's housebuilding targets. Ahead of the government's pledge to build 1.5m new homes, the CITB had already estimated there would need to be a quarter of a million new construction workers to meet the country's housing demands.\nBefore the 2025 spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced \u00a3600m worth of investment to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers, and education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has committed to 'skills bootcamps' in the construction sector being expanded, with \u00a3100m to train, upskill and develop workers.\nSo what's the plan for London?\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Sir Sadiq Khan had made the capital's housing crisis a \"a key priority for his mayoralty\".\nIn 2018, City Hall established the Mayor's Construction Academy (MCA), a scheme aimed at helping Londoners gain the skills needed to enter the construction industry. \nThe mayor's office said it hoped the MCA would help address the need for more skilled construction workers in London.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

A search for screengrabs from the video on Google found the footage actually showed Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip on 13 October 2023.\nWhile much of the debunked footage has purported to show the immediate aftermath of the Indian strikes, some clips analysed by BBC Verify appeared to be trying to portray the Pakistani response as being more severe than it actually was.\nOne video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the \"Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters\". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month.\nElsewhere, one set of photos purported to show an operation carried out by the Pakistan Air Force targeting \"Indian forward air-bases in the early hours of 6 May 2025\". The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3.\nThe Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views. \nBut two widely shared images actually showed previous Indian air force jet crashes - one from an incident in Rajasthan in 2024 and another in the Punjab state in 2021. Both crashes were widely reported.\nProf Indrajit Roy of York University said that the images \"are being generated with a view to get support for the military in Pakistan\". One clip circulated by the Pakistani military itself was later withdrawn by news agencies after it turned out to be from an unrelated event. \n\"We have jingoists on both sides of the border, and they have a huge platform on Twitter (X). You can see how fake news, as well as some real news, gets amplified, distorted and presented in ways designed to generate hostility, animosity and hatred for the other side.\"\nThe conflict in Kashmir has long attracted a high degree of misinformation online. In the aftermath of the deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, AI images circulated - with some seeking to dramatise actual scenes from the attack.\nVedika Bahl, a journalist with France 24, said the Pahalgam attacks had prompted a sharp \"uptake in misinformation from both sides surrounding the conflict\".\n\"Lots of this misinformation begins on X,\" she said. \"Eventually this trickles down over time from X to WhatsApp which is the communication tool which is most used in South Asian communities.\"\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.\nHours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\nThe strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.\nPeople living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.\nMaria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.\nIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,\" Maria says.\nShe adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border. Are we not humans?\" she asks.\n\"Now, whether there is a war or ceasefire, our children will not come back.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook\nALSO READ:",

He's very good at finding really cool people,\" says Jennifer.\nGuillaume more modestly attributes his success rate to Covid - people looking for a creative outlet - and also \"massive luck\".\n\"It's always the same story,\" he says. \n\"I have a list of 15 people to contact and I'm like: 'Okay I'm probably going to get maybe no one at all'.\n\"And every time the first one is like: 'Yeah, let's do it'.\"\nBut Guillaume does admit that he targeted people who seemed to be \"in line with the direction\" he wanted to take the project.\n\"Lorien, when we discussed the game for the first time, we had exactly the same references,\" he says.\n\"We loved the same thing. We watched the same things. The discussion was so fluid.\"\nExpedition 33 has also been widely praised for its production values - rivalling those of games worked on by hundreds, even thousands of staff.\nGuillaume attributes some of this to recent advances in tools used to make games, which allowed the team to work more efficiently.  \nHaving the backing of Kepler allowed the studio to attract actors including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis, and video game actors Jennifer English and Ben Starr.\nAnd while Sandfall did call on extra input from support studios, musicians and other specialists, Jennifer and Guillaume say the core team ended up \"wearing a lot of different hats\".\n\"And so we all pitch in and do different parts, things that may be outside of our traditional role,\" says Jennifer, who was also in charge of translating the game into different languages. \n\"We have, I think, an amazing team mostly of junior people but they are so incredibly invested in the project and talented,\" says Guillaume.\n\"Somehow it worked, which still makes no sense to me after all these years.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Northampton Saints beat Leinster to reach their first Champions Cup final since 2011\n\"We punched them in the face.\"\nAlex Mitchell's reference to an act of violence after 80 minutes of compelling European rugby at Aviva Stadium may have delivered an element of surprise.\nIt was, however, an emotive reflection which suitably matched a Northampton Saints performance that left Leinster with more than a bloodied nose in their Investec Champions Cup semi-final. \nFuelled with vengeance for last year's defeat at the same stage and a quiet confidence amid a backdrop of external doubt, the reigning Premiership champions produced the knockout blow to end Leinster's pursuit of a fifth star on the jersey with a stunning 37-34 win.\n\"A couple of pundits were saying they're going to win by 20-30 points and that Saints won't score a point,\" Saints and England scrum-half Mitchell told RTE.\n\"We showed up today and were a bit more fearless this time around. Last year, we were waiting to see what Leinster were going to do.\n\"We showed up today and the first 20 minutes, we punched them in the face. They weren't really expecting that. Credit to the boys, we got the result.\"\nConfidence in Leinster reaching a fourth consecutive final from fans and pundits alike was well-founded.\nThe Irish province pitched up at their vociferous Dublin home without having conceded a point in thumping knockout victories over Harlequins and United Rugby Championship title-holders Glasgow Warriors.\nSaints, though, had not read the script. \nEngland wing Tommy Freeman scored a first-half hat-trick to extend his tally to seven tries in three Champions Cup appearances and further strengthen his claim for British and Irish Lions selection, while Henry Pollock's star continues to rise after his searing try.\nThe hosts responded after half-time, but, somewhat uncharacteristically, lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead, while Saints were able to negate Leinster's blitz defence once more as James Ramm scored their fifth try.\nIreland wing James Lowe dragged his side to within three points to set up a thrilling finale but, after referee Pierre Brousset awarded Leinster a late penalty instead of a try, Northampton salvaged possession with a last-gasp turnover camped on their own line before kicking the ball dead.\nSaints director of rugby Phil Dowson was a member of the playing squad the last time the club overcame Leinster in 2013, but the former back row's masterminding of their latest victory is perhaps the greatest of his coaching career.\n\"Lots of people wrote us off and we understood we were underdogs but the belief within the group was outstanding,\" Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton. \n\"I would hate to think what my blood pressure was doing at the end but the last defensive set spoke volumes about our group, about the lads coming on and their impact. We got the turnover, killed the clock and cue the wild scenes in the coaching box.\n\"We have had experience before of playing into a press defence. We had practised playing through it and we revisited those principles. There were more opportunities we could've taken but we took enough to get on the scoresheet.\"\nNorthampton stun Leinster in Dublin to reach final\nWhen is the British and Irish Lions squad named?\nSaints' biggest test remains against either Bordeaux-Begles or six-time winners Toulouse in this season's showpiece in Cardiff, but if this victory underlines Dowson's era so far, his greatest servant could yet prove to be the influential Pollock, who is still remarkably in his debut campaign as a senior player.\nThe young back row, 20, has broken into Northampton's side, made his England Test debut and is a contender for Lions selection just 12 months on from watching last season's defeat at Croke Park in fancy dress as a supporter. \n\"That was a battle. I have never played in a game that hard in my life,\" Pollock told Premier Sports.\n\"That is what dreams are made of. \n\"As a boy I grew up watching this competition and to get to the final with my boyhood club, I'm emotional speaking about it. \n\"After the last two performances these Leinster boys had, to come here with no fear, we have been saying all week, 'Why not us?'.\"\nPollock's all-round performance belied his level of experience, while his try demonstrated the physical prowess of a back as he launched on to Mitchell's flat pass from a standing start to glide through a hole in Leinster's defence, before sprinting around final defender Sam Prendergast.\nAsked about applying two fingers to his neck in celebration, an enthused Pollock added: \"I was just feeling that pulse. \n\"This is why you play the game, because you love it. The fans, the sport, going up against the best back row in the world was amazing. Bring on Cardiff.\"\n'I want to get under their skin' - arch-pest Pollock aims for Leinster",

        "article_text": "Manchester United only needed a point against Manchester City to qualify for Europe\nMelvine Malard celebrated her equaliser like it was a stoppage-time winner and the Old Trafford crowd gave an outpouring of adulation. It reflected the significance of this result for Manchester United.\nNot only did they come from 2-0 down - and with 10 players after Aoife Mannion was sent off - to secure a point against bitter rivals Manchester City, it confirmed Champions League football for next season.\nFour points clear with one game left, United ended City's own hopes of playing in Europe.\nMarc Skinner's side can now prepare for a new future, looking at unique recruitment strategies and eyeing up financial gains, while City will assess where it all went wrong. \nSimply put, the 2-2 draw on Sunday was really a victory for United. \n\"To go 2-0 down, then come back, then go down to 10 players and then to see the game out... it absolutely feels like a win,\" said manager Skinner. \n\"It obviously secured Champions League football so it is a huge moment for this young team. They haven't faced many moments like that. To do it, is very special.\"\nMan Utd comeback against Man City seals Europe spot\nMan City 'fall short of standards' to miss out on Europe\nWhat's gone wrong for Man City in trophyless season?\nManchester United will compete in a third successive FA Cup final this month\nUnited have been in this position before in 2023, when they secured a Champions League spot, but failed to progress from the qualifying rounds a few months later.\nWomen's Super League champions Chelsea will go straight into the group phase of the competition next season, while second and third place go into the qualification rounds, meaning United will still have to navigate that.\nBut they want to go one step further and will attempt to attract the biggest names in Europe to compete in the competition. \nFinancially, there are rewards. Reaching the group stages of the Women's Champions League means they would receive just over \u00a3430,000 as a starting fee and bonus payments on top, depending on results.\n\"It's huge. The next step is that we have to recruit the right way,\" added Skinner.\n\"In order to go into the depths of the Champions League - and from our perspective actually qualify for the group stages - we have to add the quality of depth. \n\"Champions League gives you that. People want to come to a Champions League team. Hopefully it opens that market for us.\"\nEuropean football also gives United an elevated status in the women's game. \nThey no longer need to rely on the brand of Manchester United as a club - but the success of their performances as a team.\nIt is also a boost in their efforts to convince United co-owner, Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his staff that the women's team are worth investing in. \nSkinner added: \"The club has a big status but the women's team has a young status. We qualified [for Europe] two seasons ago but now we have done it again and that does give us a big status.\n\"When we have recruitment calls, it's always about whether we get to the Champions League - that is what the agents are saying. \n\"That status opens up more doors to give us better conversations.\"\nWhile United are planning for bigger things, they must prepare well for the crucial transfer window Skinner has constantly referred to.\nWhen they last got into Europe, United signed World Cup Golden Boot winner Hinata Miyazawa, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Brazilian winger Geyse.\nBut American Tullis-Joyce did not break into the first team until this season, alongside Miyazawa consistently, while Geyse is now on loan at Gotham FC. \nThey needed more physicality and experience, said Skinner, but the challenge this time around is to recruit players who can make an instant difference.\n\"I have not stopped all year to be honest in terms of our recruitment. We haven't just waited,\" said Skinner.\n\"We have that moment now to reflect - but it will be a big summer for us, for sure.\"\nHow will United make sure it's a successful window?\nThe club are developing their own analysis system which looks at data and statistics to help them talent spot the players who are right for them. \nTechnical director Jason Wilcox and women's head of recruitment Harvey Bussell are working together to lead the task.\n\"It's becoming much more robust. It's still in its infancy, but that's, I think, the strategy route we will go down,\" added Skinner.\n\"We've spoken as a team, we get Champions League, then we have to look at the budget and how we progress in the market. \n\"We're in a competitive market. So I've got to try to find, with my expertise, how I can make a player better.\n \"Those are the little details that we'll have to work through.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Rohit Sharma's abrupt retirement from Test cricket has jolted Indian fans, leaving the team without its captain and most seasoned opener just weeks before a pivotal five-Test series starts in England.\nIndia haven't won a Test rubber in England since 2007. To lose their captain and most experienced opening batter will compel a rethink of selection strategy for the tour.\nA charismatic leader and dashing batter, Sharma is widely regarded as a modern day great. \nHis stats in Test cricket \u2013 4,301 runs in 67 matches at an average of 40.57 are not imposing. \nBut the aplomb and authority, tactical acumen and lead-from-the-front derring-do which he has displayed has won him admiration and respect all over the cricket world.\nSharma's decision to retire from Test cricket, announced via a subdued Instagram post, has sparked widespread speculation. While various factors may have influenced his choice, his prolonged slump in Test form appears to be the primary catalyst.\nIn his last six Tests - three against New Zealand at home, three against Australia Down Under - Sharma's form was woeful. In 10 innings in these matches, he could muster a paltry 122 runs.\nTo compound the problem, India lost all these Tests. Being whitewashed by New Zealand 3-0 at home - unprecedented in Indian cricket - put Sharma under harsh scrutiny in the ensuing Border-Gavaskar series in which too he found no relief. He took the laudable, but extreme step of dropping himself from the playing XI for the last Test at Sydney.\nSince then, India won the ODI Champions Trophy in which Sharma's form was impressive. \nThe first few weeks of the ongoing IPL were disappointing but Sharma rediscovered his touch, playing important knocks to put his team Mumbai Indians strongly in the running for a place in the knockouts. But success in white-ball cricket is not necessarily an index to similar form being replicated in red-ball cricket.\nSharma is 38. His recent Test form has been ungratifying. The next World Test Championship cycle would take two years to complete. Did he have the physical wherewithal, the mental bandwidth, motivation and mojo to continue playing Test cricket? Questions he likely asked himself before calling it quits.\nSharma was the first among a clutch of talented batters emerging from the Under-19 pipeline in the first decade of this century. \nThe others were Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane. These four were to take over the mantle of India's batting responsibility from Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Saurav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag.\nIronically, while Sharma got the India cap first, in an ODI against Ireland in 2007, he was the last among this quartet to play Test cricket.\nHe was part of MS Dhoni's team which won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, but a Test place, which came relatively easily to Kohli, Pujara, Dhawan and Rahane, eluded him until Tendulkar's farewell series in 2013.\nOn debut at the Eden Gardens, Sharma made 177. In Tendulkar's swan song next match at the Wankhede, he made 111. These centuries were obscured by the overflowing of sentiment for Tendulkar, but Sharma's sublime skills, which often raised batsmanship to an art form, was not lost on experts.\nRavi Shastri, who was to have a huge influence on his Test career later by making him opener, likened him to a \"Swiss Watch\" for the precision timing in his strokeplay. Dilip Vengsarkar, former India captain who spotted him for India, highlights his ability to play late which helps in judging length of the ball quicker and better and also enables improvisation.\nThe style and finesse which made the likes of VVS Laxman and Mark Waugh so wonderful to watch were manifest in Sharma's batting from his earliest days as Test player.\nWeaned on the \"Bombay School'' of batting which boasts exemplars of orthodox technique like Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, Sharma's batting carries that strain. \nBut growing up in a post-modern milieu when risk-taking has become fundamental to batting in every format, Sharma shifted into higher gears far quicker, often from the start in Tests too once he was secure of his place.\nHe did not exhibit the bravado of a Sehwag, but when in full flow, he has often shown up the destructive ability of Viv Richards, especially when playing horizontal bat shots like hook, pull and cut.\n\nIt was not until 2019, when the then chief coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli coaxed and cajoled him to open the innings that Sharma's career in red-ball cricket bloomed.\nBy this time, he had smashed three ODI double centuries \u2013 apart from a spate of match-winning scores in T20 - establishing him as a Goliath in white-ball cricket.\nWhen he became India captain in 2021, Sharma set his sights on bagging a hat-trick of ICC trophies, and recast the team's playing strategy for each format accordingly.\nA genial, fun-loving bearing, marked by endearing earthiness helped him bond with his players easily and strongly. But he was no lax or loose on the field. He was astute, perceptive, intuitive in reading match situations, and particularly good in handling bowlers.\nFive IPL titles for Mumbai Indians bespoke his leadership credentials even before he got the job for the national team.\nUnder Sharma, India reached the World Test Championship final in 2023, only to lose to Australia. \nIn the ODI World Cup the same year, his blazing batting as opener, and his strategy of \"total attack\" in which the batsmen would go after runs unrelentingly, took India into to the final where their dreams were dashed by an inspired Australian side. Winning the T20 World Cup a few months later, was some recompense, but not complete redemption.\nIt is pertinent that Sharma, who quit T20 cricket after winning the World Cup last year, hasn't retired from ODI cricket yet.\nNot being part of an ODI World Cup winning team has been festering in him since 2011 when he was not selected in the squad under Dhoni that was to bring India glory after 28 years.\nIn an interview with podcaster Vimal Kumar released a few days back, he said that his desire to be part of an ODI World Cup winning team remains alive.\nThe next ODI World Cup is in 2027. Whether Sharma can sustain fitness and form over the two years will be followed with interest in the cricket world. \nBut that is hardly the concern of India's selectors. Right now, their worry is to find an opener and a captain to step into Sharma's big boots.",

        "article_text": "Indian writer-lawyer-activist Banu Mushtaq has scripted history by winning the International Booker prize for the short story anthology, Heart Lamp.\nIt is the first book written in the Kannada language, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, to win the prestigious prize. \nThe stories in Heart Lamp were translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi. \nFeaturing 12 short stories written by Mushtaq over three decades from 1990 to 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.\nMushtaq's win comes off the back of Geetanjali Shree's Tomb of Sand - translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell - winning the prize in 2022.\nHer body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.\nIt is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plot-lines.\n\"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention \u2014 to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.\nMushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school. \nBut her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada. \nMushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression. \nShe began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.\nIt would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.\nHer short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.\nIn an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".\nIn the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house. \nThen, a shocking act of defiance set her free.\n\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox.

Judges praised her characters as \"astonishing portraits of survival and resilience\".\nFeaturing 12 short stories written by Mushtaq between 1990 and 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.\nThe stories were selected and translated into English from Kannada, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, by Deepa Bhasthi who will share the \u00a350,000 prize. \nIn her acceptance speech, Mushtaq thanked readers for letting her words wander into their hearts.\n\"This book was born from the belief that no story is ever small; that in the tapestry of human experience, every thread holds the weight of the whole,\" she said.\n\"In a world that often tries to divide us, literature remains one of the last sacred spaces where we can live inside each other's minds, if only for a few pages,\" she added.\nBhasthi, who became the first Indian translator to win an International Booker, said that she hoped that the win would encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.\nManasi Subramaniam, Editor-in-chief of Penguin India, the book's publisher in India, told the BBC that the award was a significant win for regional literature.\n\"Following Tomb of Sand's landmark win in 2022 [Geetanjali Shree's book was translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell], Heart Lamp's triumph this year is a powerful reminder that literature in India's many languages demands our full attention. We owe it our ears,\" said Subramaniam\nMushtaq's body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.\nIt is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plotlines.\n\"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" a review in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.\nMushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school. \nBut her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada. \nMushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression. \nShe began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.\nIt would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.\nHer short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.\nIn an interview with Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\".\nIn the another interview to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house. \nThen, a shocking act of defiance set her free.\n\"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine.\nIn Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.\n\"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors \u2014 silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument.

        "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.\nThe top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.\nSo much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.\nBut 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.\nBut is that accurate, or too simplistic?\nTo get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.\nBy 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.\n\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.\n\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"\nSplits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.\nDepending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.\nWestern Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.\nBut people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.\nAs a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".\n\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.\nCzechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"\nRussia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.\nFor VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.\nThe official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.\nThat invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.\n\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"\nThis is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.\nEurope has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.\nBut this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.\nFollowing WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.\nThe idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.\nMight we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.\n\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.\nThe war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.\nEurope, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.\nThe televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.\nA YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.\nIn Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.\nIf Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.\nAnd with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.\nThe message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.\nThat's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.\nThe Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.\nUrsula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"\nStill, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.\nChina, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.\nTrump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.\nWittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".\nDespite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.\nSome also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".\nPerhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.\nAnalysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. \nThis is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.\nMr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.\n\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.\n\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"\nEight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

        "article_text": "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\". \nThe strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.\nPakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. \nIslamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. \nThis sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.\nIn 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.  \nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nExperts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.\nIndia says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. \nAmong the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. \nThe deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. \nPakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.\n\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.  \n\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.\nThe India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.\nAjay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".\n\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nIndian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".\n\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.\n\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\" \nThe majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.\n\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.\n\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"\nPakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".\nDr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.\n\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".\nChristopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.\n\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.  \n\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.\nDespite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.\n\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.\nHowever, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.\nExperts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.\n\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.\n\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"\nDr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.\n\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.\n\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.\n\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"\nIndia is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. \nShortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.\nThis mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. \nThe crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week.",

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

        "article_text": "Gianluigi Donnarumma made two superb saves to keep out Arsenal last week - this stop from Gabriel Martinelli, and another to deny Leandro Trossard\nA calamity keeper or the human wall? Arsenal's Champions League fate could be decided by which version of Gianluigi Donnarumma they face in France on Wednesday.\nWill they be thwarted again by the shot-stopper extraordinaire we saw in last week's semi-final first leg, when the giant Italian's long arms ensured Paris St-Germain escaped Emirates Stadium with a 1-0 win?\nOr could we see the return of the error-prone flapper who was left clutching at thin air as the Gunners scored from two crosses in a group-stage victory in October, where the 26-year-old put in the kind of unconvincing display that has put his entire future at the club in doubt?\nArsenal have to score at Parc des Princes or they are out, so it probably doesn't help them that Donnarumma's form has improved at the same rate the rest of the PSG team has during their thrilling Champions League campaign.\nHis supposed weaknesses have lingered longer in PSG's domestic season, however, with another mistake coming in their loss at Nice last week which ended their hopes of an unbeaten Ligue 1 campaign with only four games to go.\nStill, if you support England, or even other English teams, you may be wondering why anyone doubts Donnarumma - after all, he has already been the scourge of Liverpool and Aston Villa in Europe this season, and showed the world his prowess at stopping penalties when he helped Italy overcome the Three Lions in the shoot-out that settled the final of Euro 2020.\nThis video can not be played\nItaly win in penalty shootout against England to become European champions\nHe has performed plenty of heroics down the years, but PSG fans don't just remember Donnarumma for his big saves because, since he arrived on a free transfer from AC Milan in 2021, there have been plenty of bad errors too.\nIn any case, much more is expected of a modern-day goalkeeper than just keeping the ball out of the net, and his distribution with his feet is seen as another weakness.\nSo, does that drop him down the pecking order when we consider who is the best keeper on the planet, or is he just more proof that the perfect all-round player in his position does not exist?\nBBC Sport spoke to former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson about what makes Donnarumma special, and asked French football journalist Julien Laurens why PSG are considering replacing him this summer.\nGianluigi Donnarumma saved two penalties in the shootout that saw PSG get past Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League\nAt 6ft 5in, Donnarumma's sheer size makes him an imposing figure, physically.\nThat clearly helps when he is facing a penalty - just ask Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Darwin Nunez or Curtis Jones - but it is where he puts his enormous frame when he is dealing with shots or onrushing strikers in open play that impresses Robinson more than anything else.\n\"He's massive, but his positional awareness in his box is excellent,\" Robinson told BBC Sport. \"That's down to the depth perception he has when he is reading a through ball and his understanding of where his line is.\n\"A lot of goalkeepers get sucked into rushing off their line to try to close down the angle and to close down the shot, and they think they are in a better position further away from the goal. It is something I did myself sometimes, and you find the shot is past you before you are ready.\n\"What Donnarumma does instead, very cleverly, is stay closer to his line, maybe two or three yards away. Because of his size he knows he can cover most of his goal from there anyway.\n\"The save he made low down with his left hand from Trossard's shot last week was the perfect example of that, and of him knowing exactly where he is in relation to his line.\n\"As Trossard runs into the box, if Donnarumma is three or four yards further forward, like a lot of goalkeepers would be, that shot goes past him. Instead, he holds his position, and makes the save on the angle.\n\"It is a brilliant save and it is his physique that allows him to make it, but also down to his technique and his positional awareness, which is second to none.\"\nWhile his form has fluctuated, Donnarumma's contract situation is the main reason why his future is uncertain.\nHe has one year left on the five-year deal he signed when he joined PSG, and has reportedly been in talks about an extension.\nAccording to his agent, Enzo Raiola, Donnarumma wants to stay - but he has been also been linked to a summer return to Serie A, and Milan, with Inter, while it appears PSG may have alternatives in mind too.\n\"The club are taking their time to decide what to do,\" explained French football journalist Laurens.\n\"They like Lucas Chevalier at Lille a lot and Luis Campos (PSG's football advisor in charge of recruitment) knows Chevalier well from when he was there.\"\nChevalier was reported to be one of Manchester United's targets before they signed Andre Onana as David de Gea's replacement. He helped Lille beat Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the group stage of this season's Champions League before the French side lost to Borussia Dortmund in the last 16\nChevalier, 23, is known for his passing proficiency as well as his saving ability and is seen as the future of French goalkeeping. He broke into the senior squad for the first time at the end of 2024, although he is yet to make his senior debut for Les Bleus.\n\"PSG have not made their minds up,\" added Laurens. \"Can they really get an upgrade on Donnarumma and, if so, is Chevalier that player?\n\"Any money they get for Donnarumma \u2013 maybe \u00a325-30m - would be pure profit, but then it would probably cost around \u00a350m to get Chevalier, so what do they do?\n\"The problem they have with Donnarumma is not on his line, where he is great - everyone at the club recognises that. It is just I think (PSG boss) Luis Enrique would rather have a good goalkeeper who is better with the ball at his feet.\n\"Still, it is a difficult decision. Of course it is ideal if you can get everything you need in a goalkeeper, but I am not sure Chevalier has everything yet.\"\nPSG were in complete control of their last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022 until Benzema caught Donnarumma in possession and scored. He went on to score a 17-minute hat-trick to send Real into the quarter-finals\nIt is Donnarumma's mistakes that have led some PSG fans to lose patience with him, and seen him targeted by the French media, with one performance in particular proving hard to forget.\n\"He got some criticism recently for Harvey Elliott's goal against Liverpool, which was bad, then he made a mistake when they lost to Nice too, when their first goal went under his arm,\" Laurens said.\n\"For a long time, though, he has been seen as just not being good enough at crosses or set-pieces.\nKai Havertz put Arsenal ahead in their group-stage win over PSG in October, capitalising when Donnarumma failed to deal with a Leandro Trossard cross\n\"He has tried to work on that, just like he has tried to improve with the ball at his feet, but I don't see much of an improvement with any of his weaknesses.\n\"I think also he still carries with him his worst moment, the Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid in 2022.\n\"PSG were 1-0 up at the Bernabeu with 30 minutes to go after winning the first leg 1-0 too, but then Karim Benzema kind of barged into Donnarumma, got the ball off him and scored - and then Benzema scored two more goals quickly and PSG were out.\n\"A lot of fans remember that moment, and they feel that there is another mistake coming somewhere, but every time we see him doing well, that surely gets him more points to stay and have his contract extended than the other way around.\"\nDonnarumma may have his detractors but the stats are on his side - new data ranks him higher than any other goalkeeper in the world.\nThe CIES Football Observatory Index takes into account the level of games played plus results, and also measures the quality of chances faced at domestic level to look at the how the number of expected goals from those chances compare to how many were conceded.\nIt places Donnarumma above Yann Sommer of Inter Milan and Real Madrid's Thibault Courtois at the top of a list which has a couple of notable omissions - Liverpool's Alisson and Manchester City's Ederson both fail to make the top 20.\nDonnarumma has won 72 caps for Italy and played 251 games for AC Milan before joining PSG in 2021. He has played 151 games all competitions for the French side, and has won Ligue 1 four times\nRobinson used a different criteria, including his eyes, to come up with an alternative top three where Alisson does appear, along with Donnarumma.\n\"For me, Alisson is the best in the world, because he hasn't forgotten the fundamentals of goalkeeping, which are to keep the ball out of the net,\" Robinson explained.\n\"Commanding your box, communicating with your back four, stopping shots and dealing with one on ones are all part of that, but he can adapt to the modern way of playing out from the back too, without taking it to the next level like Ederson does.\n\"Ederson is the best with his feet but for the all-round package there is Alisson, Jan Oblak at Atletico Madrid and Donnarumma, and you can put those three in the same bracket.\n\"To be the very best you need the right mindset too, and Donnarumma has that. He has played so many games since his debut for AC Milan aged 16 that he is much more experienced than most keepers his age.\n\"That maturity means he is comfortable on the biggest stage, and can make a difference the way he has done so many times already.\n\"There is this uncertainty about where he will be next year but I bet PSG are glad they have got him at the moment - if they go on to win the Champions League this season, he will play a huge part in that.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.\nHours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\nThe strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.\nPeople living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.\nMaria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.\nIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,\" Maria says.\nShe adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border.

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York with jury selection on Monday. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on Monday.\nThe first days of the trial will consist of jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial will take place in front of US District Judge Arun Subramanian at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.\nThe trial is expected to be open to the public, but won't be streamed online.\nCameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.\n\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "Nothing has convinced Sabine Zetteler of the value of using AI.\n\"I read a really great phrase recently that said something along the lines of 'why would I bother to read something someone couldn't be bothered to write' and that is such a powerful statement and one that aligns absolutely with my views.\"\nMs Zetteler runs her own London-based communications agency, with around 10 staff, some full-time some part-time.\n\"What's the point of sending something we didn't write, reading a newspaper written by bots, listening to a song created by AI, or me making a bit more money by sacking my administrator who has four kids?\n\"Where's the joy, love or aspirational betterment even just for me as a founder in that? It means nothing to me,\" she says.\nMs Zetteler is among those resisting the AI invasion, which really got going with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022.\nSince then the service, and its many rivals have become wildly popular. ChatGPT is racking up over five billion visits a month, according to software firm Semrush.\nBut training AI systems like ChatGPT requires huge amounts of energy and, once trained, keeping them running is also energy intensive. \nWhile it's difficult to quantify the electricity used by AI, a report by Goldman Sachs estimated that a ChatGPT query uses nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query.\nThat makes some people uncomfortable.\nFor Florence Achery, owner of Yoga Retreats & More, the environmental impact is one reason why she vows to stay away from AI.\n\"My initial reaction was that AI is soulless and is a contradiction with my business, which is all about human connection,\" says Achery, based in London.\n\"However, I found out that the environmental impact was awful with all the energy consumption required to run the data centres. I don't think that people are aware of that.\"\nWhile Ms Zetteler admits she respects AI for all the social-good it can achieve, she says she's concerned about the wider impact on society.\n\"I'm happy that AI exists for blind people if they can have articles translated by AI and anything that is truly beneficial. But in general, I don't think it will benefit us long-term.\"\nIs she worried it might have a knock-on effect on her business, especially if rival companies are using AI?\n\"Like everything, I could save money by sending our agency to Milan on EasyJet flights rather than the train.\n\"Already my profit margins look unsuccessful if that's how you measure success, but how about if you measure success by how much you're contributing to society and how well you sleep?\"\nSierra Hansen, who lives in Seattle and works in public affairs, also refuses to use AI. For her, she's concerned that the use of AI is harming our ability to problem solve.\n\"Our brain is the thing that helps organise what our days look like, not going to AI Copilot and asking it to tell it how to manage my schedule.\n\"Our job as a human is to apply critical thinking skills, and if you are feeding simple tasks into ChatGPT then you're not solving on your own. It's doing the thinking for you. If I want to listen to music, I don't need AI to create the perfect punk rock album for me.\"\nBut not everyone has the luxury of opting out of AI.\nJackie Adams (not her real name), who works in digital marketing, resisted AI initially on environmental grounds, and because she thought using it was lazy.\n\"I heard about the energy needed to power data centres and the amount land they take up, and it didn't sit right with me. I didn't understand why we needed it,\" she says.\nHowever, about a year ago her three colleagues at the marketing firm she works for started adopting AI, for tasks such as copywriting and idea generation.\nSix months ago Ms Adams had to follow them, after being told she had to cut her budget.\n\"Then it was out my control,\" she says. She feels that continuing to resist would have hurt her career.\n\"I started playing with it a bit more after reading job descriptions asking for AI experience. I recently realised that if I don't implement it into my ways of working, I'm going to get left behind.\"\nNow, she says, she doesn't view tapping into AI as laziness anymore.\n\"It can elevate my work and make some things better,\" adding that she uses it to refine copywriting work and for editing photos.\nThe moment to opt out of AI has already passed, says James Brusseau, a philosophy professor specialising in AI ethics at Pace University in New York.\n\"If you want to know why a decision is made, we will need humans. If we don't care about that, then we will probably use AI,\" he says.\n\"So, we will have human judges for criminal cases, and human doctors to make decisions about who should get the transplant. But, weather forecasting will be gone soon, and anesthesiology too,\" says Prof Brusseau.\nMs Adam has accepted using AI at work, but she still feels despondent about AI's growing influence.\n\"Even when you do a Google search it includes an AI overview, while some emails have a topline summary, So now it almost feels like we have no control. How do I turn all that off? It's snowballing.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK? Sign up here.",

        "article_text": "The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.\nOn Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.\nPakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.\nAs Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.\n\"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.\nSince Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.\nPakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.  \nLaser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement. \nDrones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek.\nExperts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.\nThe Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft). \nWhile many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities. \nIndia is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.\nPakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.\nHe said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities. \nMr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.\nProf Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\".\nWhile the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.\n\"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.\nEjaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\". \n\"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.\n\nWhile drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.\n\"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi.\n\"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\"\nClearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.\n\"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek.\n\"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\" ",

        "article_text": "At a time when women's participation in the film industry was frowned upon, a young woman dared to dream differently.\nIn 1920s pre-independence India, PK Rosy became the first female lead in Malayalam-language cinema, in what is now the southern state of Kerala.\nShe starred in a movie called Vigathakumaran, or The Lost Child, in the 1920s. But instead of being remembered as a pioneer, her story was buried - erased by caste discrimination and social backlash. \nRosy belonged to a lower-caste community and faced intense criticism for portraying an upper-caste woman in Vigathakumaran. \nAlmost a hundred years later, there is no surviving evidence of Rosy's role. The film's reel was destroyed and the cast and crew have all died. \nOnly a few pictures of the film from a contested press release dated October 1930 survive, along with an unverified black-and-white photo popularised by local newspapers as Rosy's only portrait.\nEven a Google Doodle celebrating her 120th birthday used an illustration similar to the woman in the photograph. But Rosy's nephew and others who have researched her life told the BBC that they could not conclusively say that it is her in the picture.  \nPK Rosy was born as Rajamma in the early 1900s in the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, now Kerala.\nShe belonged to a family of grass cutters from the Pulaya community, part of the Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's harsh caste hierarchy and have been historically oppressed.\n\"People from the Pulaya community were considered slave labour and auctioned off with land,\" says Malavika Binny, a professor of history at Kannur University. \n\"They were considered the 'lowliest'. They were flogged, raped, tied to trees and set on fire for any so-called transgressions,\" she adds. \nDespite the dire social challenges, Rosy chose to dream differently. \nShe was supported by her uncle, who was a theatre artist himself, and with his help Rosy entered the field of entertainment. \n\"There are few available facts about Rosy's life, but it is known that she was popular for her performances in local plays,\" says Vinu Abraham, the author of The Lost Heroine, a novel based on Rosy's life.\nWhile her acting skills earned admiration, it was rare for a Dalit woman to take up acting at the time.\n\"She was likely aware of the fact that this was a new arena and making herself visible was important,\" says Prof Binny.\nShe soon became a well-known figure in local theatre circles and her talent caught the eye of director JC Daniel, who was then searching for a lead actor for his film - a character named Sarojini. \nDaniel was aware of Rosy's caste identity and chose to cast her in the role. \n\"She was paid five rupees a day for 10 days of filming,\" said Mr Abraham. \"This was a substantial amount of money in the 1920s.\"\nOn the day of the film's premiere, Rosy and her family were barred from attending the screening.\nThey were stopped because they were Dalits, Rosy's nephew Biju Govindan says. \nAnd so began a chain of events that pushed Rosy out of the public eye and her home.\n\"The crowd that came to watch the movie were provoked by two things: Rosy playing an upper-caste woman and the hero picking a flower from her hair and kissing it in one scene,\" said Mr Abraham.\n\"They started throwing rocks at the screen and chased Daniel away,\" he added.\nThere are differing accounts of the extent of the damage to the theatre but what is clear is the toll the incident took on both Rosy and Daniel.\nDaniel had spent a lot of money to establish a studio and gather resources to produce the film, and was heavily debt-ridden. Facing immense social and financial pressure, the director, who is now widely regarded as the father of Malayalam cinema, never made another film. \nRosy fled her hometown after an angry mob set her house on fire.\nShe cut all ties with her family to avoid being recognised and never spoke publicly about her past. She rebuilt her life by marrying an upper-caste man and took the name Rajammal.\nShe lived the rest of her life in obscurity in the town of Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, Mr Abraham says.  \nHer children refused to accept that PK Rosy, the Dalit actor, was their mother, Rosy's nephew Mr Govindan says. \n\"Her children were born with an upper-caste Kesavan Pillai's identity. They chose their father's seed over their mother's womb,\" he says. \n\"We, her family, are part of PK Rosy's Dalit identity before the film's release,\" he said.\n\"In the space they inhabit, caste restricts them from accepting their Dalit heritage. That is their reality and our family has no place in it.\" \nIn 2013, a Malayalam TV channel tracked down Rosy's daughter Padma, who was living in financial strain somewhere in Tamil Nadu. She told them that she did not know much about her mother's life before her marriage but that she did not act after that. \nThe BBC made attempts to contact Rosy's children, but their relatives said they were not comfortable with the attention.\nProf Binny says that the erasure of Rosy's legacy shows how deeply caste-based trauma can run.\n\"It can be so intense that it shapes or defines the rest of one's life,\" she says, adding that she is glad Rosy eventually found a safe space.\nIn recent years, Dalit filmmakers and activists have sought to reclaim Rosy's legacy. Influential Tamil director Pa Ranjith has launched a yearly film festival in her name which celebrates Dalit cinema. A film society and foundation have also been established. \nBut there is still a haunting sense that while Rosy was ultimately saved, it was at the cost of her passion and identity.\n\"Rosy prioritised survival over art and, as a result, never tried to speak publicly or reclaim her lost identity. That's not her failure - it's society's,\" says Mr Govindan.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.\nHours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\nThe strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.\nPeople living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.\nMaria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.\nIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,\" Maria says.\nShe adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border.

        "article_text": "In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".\nBehind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.\nHowever, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. \nIndia accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing \"responsibility and restraint.\"\nBefore Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.\nAfter a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. \nThe rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.\nTanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".\n\"There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.\n\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.\nThis isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an India\u2013Pakistan crisis.\nIn his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.\nFormer Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.\nBut diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.\n\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.\nYet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.\nAs tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's \"fundamentally none of our business\".\n\"We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, \" he said in a television interview. \nMeanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".\nEjaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.\n\"The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.\nExperts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent \"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. \nThe NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. \nThis was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.\n\"The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,\" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.\nWhat also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.\nIndian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after Pulwama\u2013Balakot in 2019: \nDespite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. \nWhether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.\nDoubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.\n\"This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,\" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. \n\"Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment.\"",

He's very good at finding really cool people,\" says Jennifer.\nGuillaume more modestly attributes his success rate to Covid - people looking for a creative outlet - and also \"massive luck\".\n\"It's always the same story,\" he says. \n\"I have a list of 15 people to contact and I'm like: 'Okay I'm probably going to get maybe no one at all'.\n\"And every time the first one is like: 'Yeah, let's do it'.\"\nBut Guillaume does admit that he targeted people who seemed to be \"in line with the direction\" he wanted to take the project.\n\"Lorien, when we discussed the game for the first time, we had exactly the same references,\" he says.\n\"We loved the same thing. We watched the same things. The discussion was so fluid.\"\nExpedition 33 has also been widely praised for its production values - rivalling those of games worked on by hundreds, even thousands of staff.\nGuillaume attributes some of this to recent advances in tools used to make games, which allowed the team to work more efficiently.  \nHaving the backing of Kepler allowed the studio to attract actors including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis, and video game actors Jennifer English and Ben Starr.\nAnd while Sandfall did call on extra input from support studios, musicians and other specialists, Jennifer and Guillaume say the core team ended up \"wearing a lot of different hats\".\n\"And so we all pitch in and do different parts, things that may be outside of our traditional role,\" says Jennifer, who was also in charge of translating the game into different languages. \n\"We have, I think, an amazing team mostly of junior people but they are so incredibly invested in the project and talented,\" says Guillaume.\n\"Somehow it worked, which still makes no sense to me after all these years.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.\nHours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.\nThe strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.\nPeople living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.\nMaria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.\nIndia has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.\nOn 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.\nIt wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.\nTerrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.\n\"My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,\" Maria says.\nShe adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.\nSince his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.\nMaria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.\nOn 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.\nRameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.\nAfter the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.\n\"The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,\" she says.\n\"If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,\" says Maria. \n\"We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border.

        "article_text": "Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. \nThe city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. \nThree people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday.\nBengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. \nMany parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. \nThis is \"rare\" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. \nApart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. \nIn one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee.\nVideos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. \nAuthorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to \"rectify\" the situation. \n\"There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,\" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. \nBut officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. \n\"No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,\" a user wrote on X.\nAnnu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. \n\"Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,\" she said. \nItty, who works in public policy, says a \"lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits\", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. \nKarnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.\nThe BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, \u00a387.5m) for relief operations.\nThe state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.\n\"The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,\" Shivakumar said.\nFloods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.\nAnanda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused \"discomfort and inconvenience\" for businesses. \n\"Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,\" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure. \n",

        "article_text": "Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\nThe Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named \"Operation Sindoor\" - were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead.\nBut Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in that attack, described the strikes as \"unprovoked\", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the \"heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished\".\nSharif on Wednesday said the Pahalgam attack \"wasn't related\" to Pakistan, and that his country was \"accused for the wrong\" reasons.\nPakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.\nPakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.\nLate on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a \"reply from our side to them\".\nDelhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.\nIt said these sites were \"terrorist infrastructure\" - places where attacks were \"planned and directed\". \nIt emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its \"actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature\".\nIn the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab.

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

It was incredibly winding.\"\nHe was diagnosed so early in the UK Aids epidemic that he was named Patient L1 at the hospital, and his story was featured in the 2014 film Pride.\nRecalling the early days of diagnosis, he told BBC London \"every single lymph node in my body had just erupted\". \nAfter undergoing tests in hospital, he was kept in a side ward for two days.\nJonathan, who is now 76, said he was told by doctors he would be given \"palliative care when the time comes\" - to which he thought: \"I'm 33, do I really want to hear about palliative care?\"\nHe added: \"I have been living with this virus and literally just trying to live every day. Never thinking that I will have a life, it's always been there.\"\nHIV is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.\nAids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is when a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses happen when the immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.\nWhile Aids cannot be transmitted from one person to another, the HIV virus can.\n\"It really wasn't until 2015, when they first announced 'U = U', 'Undetectable = Untransmittable', that I was no longer this kind of leper - that I had this poisoned blood, that I could infect anybody,\" Jonathan said.\nThe term means that if someone has an undetectable viral load, they cannot sexually transmit HIV to others.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust charity reports that by 1999, 33m people were living with HIV worldwide while the World Health Report listed Aids as the fourth biggest killer worldwide, 20 years after the epidemic began.\nAccording to the National Aids Trust, 2023 was the highest year for people receiving HIV care with 107,949 treated - an increase of 27% across the last 10 years.\nJonathan said: \"HIV is this forgotten epidemic. It is never talked about and it's so important it is. \n\"A lot of that is to do with stigma.\"\nHe added: \"I was on effective medication, because we have an amazing NHS. I am so fortunate that I have had access to the medication.\n\"The most important thing to do is know your status, be brave, get tested.\n\"The developments that are happening are extraordinary - even though there is no cure,\" he continued.\n\"I'm living proof.\"\nJonathan attended the launch on Wednesday of the report Getting to zero by 2030: HIV in London at the site of the future\u00a0HIV/Aids Memorial which is planned to be placed in Fitzrovia.\nIn 2018, the London mayor, London Councils, Public Health England and NHS England signed up to the Fast-Track Cities Declaration to reach zero new HIV infections, zero HIV-related stigma and zero HIV-related deaths by 2030.\nThe report, by the London Assembly Health Committee, found that despite progress in attitudes towards HIV, HIV-related stigma remained prevalent in London and the UK.\nLondon has historically had, and continues to have, higher rates of HIV than the rest of the country. \nHowever, the London Assembly said the city was leading the way globally to end new HIV cases and was seen as a leading international example through its HIV prevention and treatment programmes.\nThe Assembly added that \"concerted action\" would be required to increase testing, improve access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), ensure that everyone with HIV could access the care they needed and that services must reach people and communities who were currently missing out on them. \nRecommendations in the report included:\nChair of the\u00a0London Assembly Health Committee, Krupesh Hirani,\u00a0said London was \"a long way off\" reaching its 2030 target.\n\"After many years in which there was a year-on-year decline in new HIV cases, there has been an increase in cases in London and England since 2020. We would like to see the mayor take further action,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the mayor said Sadiq Khan would respond to the Assembly's report in due course.\nThey added: \"The current government has committed to commissioning a new HIV action plan and the mayor looks forward to working closely with ministers to help end HIV cases by 2030, as we build a fairer and healthier London for everyone.\" \nIn December 2023, the mayor announced \u00a3130,000 of funding from the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm towards the construction of a permanent HIV and Aids memorial in London. \nAids Memory UK, which is behind the project, said the memorial would be unveiled at the end of 2027 and the artwork would take the form of a felled tree.\nAmbassador of Aids Memorial UK, Mzz Kimberley, also known as Kim Tatum, said: \"The memorial is going to be a place where people can go and reflect, educate themselves, feel peace, talk to people.\n\"This memorial will mean that everyone who lost their life had meaning. \n\"It's a dedication to all the people around the world who've lost their life, or the injustices that society has brought to them.\"\nThe memorial means a lot to Jonathan, saying it would help \"create a community - I am so proud to be part of this HIV community.\n\"I've lost lots of friends - some very, very early but some more recently, and it still hurts.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

A drone then bombed a local market, MSF said.\nThe hospital is the only one in Fangak county, which has a population of more than 110,000 people, MSF said, and all its medical supplies were destroyed. \nThe charity called the attack, which left 20 people injured, a \"clear violation of international humanitarian law\".\nMSF spokesman Mamman Mustapha told the BBC's Newshour programme the charity was still trying to establish the facts, but local witnesses had said the aircraft were \"government forces helicopters\".\n\"The hospital is clearly marked as 'hospital' with our logo,\" he said. \"We have shared also our coordinates for all the warring parties in the area so the hospital should be known to both parties as a hospital.\"\nThere was no immediate comment from South Sudan's government. The BBC has contacted the foreign affairs ministry.\nIn recent weeks, Nicholas Haysom, who leads the UN mission in South Sudan, has warned the country is \"teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war\".\nThose worries have been stoked by an escalating feud between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.\nHours before the hospital bombing, the head of the army, Paul Majok Nang, promised punitive strikes after several barges on a river were hijacked.\nHe blamed those attacks on a militia linked to Vice-President Machar, who has not commented on the claim.\nMachar was arrested in March along with several of his associates, and accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.\nThe government has recently listed counties it considers to be hostile - in other words allied to Machar. \nThat increased the suspicion that South Sudan could be headed for another conflict involving the country's two largest ethnic groups.\nSouth Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but two years later, a civil war erupted when President Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\nThe ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes \u2013 more than a fifth of the population.\nA peace deal was reached in 2018 and a unity government forged with the same two men at the helm, but elections that were supposed to have been called since then have not happened.\nThe peace deal was also meant to see the end of all the militias and the formation of one united army \u2013 but that has not happened and many armed groups are still loyal to different politicians.\nThe current crisis was sparked earlier this year when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir.\nThen, in March, a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general.\nRights groups have been calling for the military to stop bombing civilian areas.\nAdditional reporting by Yemisi Adegoke & Nichola Mandil\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. \nThe city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. \nThree people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday.\nBengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. \nMany parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. \nThis is \"rare\" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. \nApart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. \nIn one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee.\nVideos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. \nAuthorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to \"rectify\" the situation. \n\"There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,\" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. \nBut officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. \n\"No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,\" a user wrote on X.\nAnnu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. \n\"Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,\" she said. \nItty, who works in public policy, says a \"lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits\", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. \nKarnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.\nThe BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, \u00a387.5m) for relief operations.\nThe state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.\n\"The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,\" Shivakumar said.\nFloods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.\nAnanda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused \"discomfort and inconvenience\" for businesses. \n\"Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,\" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure. \n",
